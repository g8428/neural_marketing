      "Squid game is an entertaining series with a great plot and a lot of scenes that kept you watching.\n",
      "I beleive this TV series is hardly a normal one. It also has some illogical concepts and sequences like \"scanning masks in order to uphold security\".\n",
      "Squid Game: Season 1 offers an exciting character-driven drama, but is unable to avoid some filler content.\n",
      "There were logic errors from time to time but end of all chapters were intriguing and surprising.I really liked\n",
      "Literally cannot pick a single flaw in this show. Second best series I've ever watched behind Breaking Bad. The whole show is basically a masterclass on plot twists and character development.\n",
      "Pues no está mal, es entretenida, pero sobrevalorada más allá de cualquier límite.\n",
      "One of the greatest shows ever made. I believe it is absolutely flawless. The characters, the screenplay, the plot, the pacing, the drama, the horror. Bravo\n",
      "Definitely the best spent time procrastinating. I don’t even think I’ll be able to get this show out of my head for at least a month.\n",
      "Totally worth it. It is one of the best narratives I have seen in years. Of course, you have to watch it in Korean to really appreciate the acting.\n",
      "Great and very deep show. Of course there are a lot of haters giving the show low ratings, they don't like the truth. And the truth is Squid Game is an excellent distillation of how predatory capitalism works.\n",
      "Do they have to scream in every scene?! Like, all the time??? (The \"Fly Me to the Moon\" cover is good, though.)\n",
      "It's a pretty decent netflix show, but honestly, i think it's kinda overrated.\n",

      "An incredible series. Such a level of tension and interest has not been caused for a long time by TV series and, in principle, everything that has been in pop culture for a long time. Applause for the creators!\n",
      "Took a few episodes for me to be hooked in, but when I finally was, it took off. From loving a character to absolutely hating them, this show made you feel. This being my first Korean show watch, I will never regret it. Episode 6, tears galore.\n",

      "Very addictive to watch. I binge watched it. Only the dubbed version can be a bit weird when it comes to voice lines.\n",
      "One of the best series i have every watched! It gives you suspense, drama and exciting moments. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. The characters are well established, the performances are exceptional. Please do watch it!\n",

      "I've seen it multiple times, and I still enjoy it. It's very emotional. I would recommend anyone watch it if you think you're into these kinds of shows.\n",
      "What will you do for money? is the main idea of Squid Game. Netflix's global hit is well-deserving, but is not 'perfect', hopefully we can get more answers in S2.\n",
      "Massively overhyped nonsense. CGI is fairly poor quality. Storyline isn't great and the characters aren't very engaging. I wouldn't recommend this, and certainly wouldn't compare it to squid game!\n",
      "Big surprise of the year, ‘Hellbound’ breaks several barriers, exposes the worst of humanity, ending its first season in a glorious and dark way. A work of the highest level.\n",
      "First season itself is a bit too fragmented. But still very thrilling. High expectations on season 2 to bring it back together.\n",
      "This series was a waste of potential. Intriguing premise but squandered with a weak script, shock value, and a barrage of disturbing imagery and behavior. Presents humanity at its worth to the point of absurdity.\n",
      "Один из самых тупых сериалов. Никаких объяснений, одна глупость героев, сюжета и абсолютно неинтересные персонажи.\n",
      "This is a amazing show, alot of action, twist and turns. I really thinkthis deserves a 10/10.\n",
      "The show is close to a 10, highly addictive and bingey, not cringey. I am not one of those blindly love everything Korean people but I just found this highly entertaining. Better than Squid Game.\n",
      "Very entertaining thrilling\n",
      "Some minor flaws but overall binge worthy\n",
