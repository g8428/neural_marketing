Squid game did great in creating specific games, music and characters relationships. Now the negatives. Squid Game did terribly in doing the layout of story. There are many unrealistic moments just to keep the important characters alive. Story can be chaotic and you can get easily lost. Ending of 1st season is terrible and unrealistic. You will just look at it and wonder how could someone come up with this nonsense. Squid Game is little bit overhyped show. Its not bad and I really enjoyed many parts but that storywriting, oh boy.',\n",

I’ll confess that I fast forwarded thru some of the character dialogue scenes. They really weren’t that interesting, plus the perilous situations provide the fun and in later episodes the violence. This international phenomena is certainly unique, but more a curiosity for the weirdness than any kind of important drama.

              " 'Squid Game is of the Puzzle-Adventure-Mystery-Survival-Drama genre. This is a plot type that has been used many times and recently in Asian films.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line: I\\'ll watch season 2 if it is developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acting ranges from good to not-good. The writing is good accept the basic premise of the plot seems somewhat contrived and not believable. The \"games\" may feel silly and not believable. The VIP characters seemed badly developed with poor acting - in my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirecting, editing and other technicals are of professional quality. Casting seemed mostly appropriate. Squid Game is a film series that you don\\'t appreciate until the last episode. If you only watch the first view episodes you will not be able to appreciate what it has to offer. Take that into consideration as many film reviewers only watch the beginning of films.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the English language audio dubs were not good. I do not speak Korean - but, after the second episode I used the original Korean audio track (with English subtitles) and found the acting much more enjoyable. If you are American and if you are not familiar with Korean, you may find the long-vowel sounds that Koreans use for emphasis to be annoying - but, there is less of that in the later episodes and your ear will attenuate after a few episodes. The social commentary was relevant - in my opinion. Many years ago I listened to a radio talk show involving personal debt crisis. People\\'s lives had been destroyed by credit card debt, student loan debt, spending too much on their car and spending too much on their home, etc. The host of the radio program would help people put together a plan to drastically reduce their spending (often by selling their \"luxury car\" and sometimes by selling their home) and pay off their debts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a lot of over the top, over-speculation in the symbolism within this film. The director has been clear that symbolism (involving the colors of red and blue, for example) were not his intent.',\n",
              " 'One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is \"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children\\'s games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake\". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother\\'s card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the same can\\'t be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don\\'t feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game. Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.',\n",

Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me.

We've seen the same basic premise in dozens of other movies and TV shows that have come before it. Second, with the exceptions of Lee Jung-Jae and Park Hae-Soo. But even their decent performances couldn't save a show in which the majority of the acting is something that belongs either in a daytime soap opera, the characters are one-dimensional caricatures, and the dialogue is overwhelmingly cliche. In fact, the acting is so over the top and melodramatic that I repeatedly found myself laughing at moments that were meant to be tragic, depressing, or shocking. The trophy for bad-acting, however, should go to the foreigners who were hired as English-speaking actors to play the roles of VIP clients. I've seen better acting in elementary school plays, and that is not hyperbole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, if you're into cheap plot twists, and you know that you enjoy other Korean dramas that ooze melodrama and hackneyed tropes, then this might be up your alley.

I like how it incorporates today's pandemic scenario and protocol into this show. It makes a lot of sense and after all it's about virus. The show also has a main villain, the boss, that is unusual and unique. Each episode is a story gripping. Characters are well developed and each of them are unique individuals. Their interactions are very interesting to watch especially when they are all kept getting stuck in a confined space and trying to figure out how to escape. Consequently that is when their deep personalities reveal. There are many other supporting characters that are uniquely told and developed. This show is like mix bags of Escape Room, World War Z, Resident Evil and one other popular movie (don't want to spoil). Surprisingly this show is actually based on a Webtoon, Korean online graphic novel. That's how good this is for it to be converted into live action. It has high potential for season 2 like Squid Game but somehow it has better and thorough ending (can be stand alone without season 2) and it doesn't leave you hanging like Squid Game. Highly recommended. It's absolutely entertaining to watch. Just don't overly analyze things and after all it's just fictional show\",\n",

I almost binged it and it left me wanting for more and now wish I could forget it and watch again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan, this series was cast really nicely and there\\'s almost every single stereotypical student/adult archetype you can think of. Each actor/actress played their role so well and it was really well acted. There\\'s a ton of action, even more gore, with enough humour to separate it from other zombie series, with the added bonus of undertones that permeates through to the real world like how unforgiving the world can be, how we treat one another in times of crisis, what we can choose to do when every moment there\\'s the possibility of death, and so on. No episode felt like filler, and with 12 episodes there\\'s a lot of time to flesh out characters and the plot nicely. My favourite characters are Dae-su, Su-hyeok, Mijin and Jae-Ik. Dae-su and Mijin are priceless. Certain characters have such relatable personalities. Don\\'t think anyone was \\'annoying\\' at all. Music is okay-good but the sound effects are *chef\\'s kiss*.

Les personnages sont bien caractérisés et leur parcours permet de mettre en lumière les graves problèmes du harcèlement scolaire et la dureté de l’enseignement si l’on veut espérer intégrer une université…\\r\\n\\r\\nMais nos lycéens ont rapidement d’autres chats à fouetter, notamment des hordes de zombis à dérouiller… et parfois à tuer, car le zombi coréen est beaucoup plus brutal, retors et difficile à tuer que le zombi américain. Cela étant, la série reprend à son compte tous les clichés du genre : la survie impitoyable, les gentils et les salopards, les traîtres et les lâches… et tutti quanti.\\r\\n\\r\\nMais le rythme reste toujours très élevé sur les 12 épisodes d’une heure chacun en moyenne et on reste happé d’un bout à l’autre, du début à la fin.

Quelques choix scénaristiques étonnent (le père puis le militaire par exemple) tandis que les romances font décidément très « manga »… dans ce lycée coréen qui a tout d’un lycée… japonais !\\r\\n\\r\\nPar ailleurs, si la guimauve peut sembler maladroite, elle reste de bien meilleure qualité que ce qu’on peut voir dans les séries hollywoodiennes, notamment ces merdes comme les Walking Dead et dérivés.

              " 'I\\'m a sucker for these zombie movies and shows. They always manage to pull me into watching it. Korea somehow manages to make zombies more interesting compared to western movies and shows. For example, Train to Busan was absolutely stellar. My hope was that this show was on the level of that movie. So does Korea deliver another excellent zombie action or is it a big miss?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s get the obvious out of the way first, the zombie action is indeed exciting to watch. There are some exciting and creative sequences in this show such as the dining hall sequence which is filmed like one shot. There are some other creative sequences such as one involving a fight between two individuals on top of bookcases while zombies are underneath. Another is where the characters build a giant wall to hold off zombies while they escape the other way. Another is where they create a circular wall while getting from point A to B. All these sequences feel very original and I certainly enjoyed watching them. I also have to give a lot of praise to the makeup artist as the zombies look frighteningly good. The zombie actors also do a good job as well in making them feel inhuman and unnatural. The zombies here are definitely quite scary and that is quite a feat considering how oversaturated zombies are in media.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actors all do a phenomenal job in their portrayal. They all manage to give their characters distinct personalities even if they are just minor characters. The actors who die and become zombies also do a great job as zombies. The story is also quite engaging despite just being mostly about surviving. The story focuses on the dynamic and relationship of the surviving school students. We see them work together but also argue and fight but it never feels over the top or anything. What the story does the best is in delivering on the emotions and there is definitely some emotional stuff. We also got a more interesting origin for the virus that is also quite sympathetic and we got some special zombies that give the situation more spice to it. They also spend a fair amount of time with the military in the series to give the audience an understanding of their response to the virus. There is also quite a bit of romance in this and it surprisingly works well despite the situation not being the exact best for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a lot of characters in this show and honestly maybe too many. The show doesn\\'t just focus on one group of survivors and instead multiple groups which lead to a lot of characters to pay attention to. What can be annoying is that a fair amount of these characters have nothing interesting to them but the series still spends a fair amount of time on them. If a character doesn\\'t have an interesting backstory or personality then they are probably going to die which results in predictable deaths. There are also some characters that are just in the series for no reason such as a streamer that I felt added nothing to the plot apart from taking screen time away from actual interesting characters. Additionally, there are so many moments in this series where a character makes a really stupid decision that is frustrating to watch. Also, the characters not going for the head is a big annoyance. It also gets annoying when some characters stand around instead of helping their friend who is being attacked. The series is also a bit too long and can feel a bit exhausting to watch. It is 12 episodes but after watching, it definitely felt like the series could at least be cut down by 2 episodes. There is a lot of sequences where it does just feel like they are padding for time. For example, we will have scenes where we watch characters stand around or just building and not talking or a scene where they share chocolate and it all feels too long and pointless. There is a \"villain\" in the show and that person is WAY too overused and gets defeated in the same way like 4 times, to the point that it is kind of laughable. There are also some potentially interesting plot lines that they could\\'ve explored but it is never utilized or explored. There are also some characters that just die for shock value which sucks as it feels like the show would be more interesting if they were kept alive. Overall, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling and exciting zombie show that unfortunately stumbles on all the subplots created. I did come out a little disappointed that they didn\\'t utilize everything the show introduced effectively but it was still a really good time. It does end with a potential tease for season 2 and it might resolve some of the remaining plot threads from season 1. The ending is also quite interesting and it does make me wonder what direction they could go in. Thus I am hopeful for a season 2 despite the show\\'s shortcomings.',\n",
              " 'Some of the contrivances in this are just insane. Your suspension of disbelief must be at an all-time high to excuse some of the characters ridiculous/poor decisions. That doesn\\'t make it a bad show though. However, it does mean you\\'ll be sat there saying things like: \"Omg would you just close the door behind you ffs\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Omg would you run, run, like seriously! RUN! You have so much time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just tell her! Omg just tell him! Talk to each other ffs!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why are you still standing there? Omg do something!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can no one see that? It\\'s right there, are these people blind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait at the end of the last episode he was about to... How is he... what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if you can ignore all the times you\\'ll feel this way, WHICH WILL BE A LOT, it\\'s an okay zombie show. Initially I was worried about teen angst, I don\\'t like teen drama, its usually boring and revolves around people not saying things that could easily solve 90% of any and all problems. Luckily the show splits its focus from time to time, and we get to see different groups of people dealing with very different situations. It\\'s a good break from the Teen angle and lets us see glimpses of how the world is reacting to this situation. I think if this were written a bit better, with less contrivances, and characters I actually cared about, I could\\'ve given it a higher score.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think if people are overly positive about this it\\'s the whole K-pop vibe people are on... Essentially, anything Korean gets a pass due to pop culture favouritism. Whereas, if people are overly negative, it\\'s potentially due to the cliched teen drama, contrivance filled writing and dumb character decisions that they can\\'t overlook for the sake of entertainment. Look, it\\'s no Kingdom. It\\'s no Train to Busan (THE 1ST ONE OMG that second movie was baaaad). But it\\'s an okay watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, one last thing... Too many episodes.',\n",

              "'Squid Game is average show. Average actors, average characters etc. Only reasons why im not voting for 4 is that there are some well made plots and its an original show. Squid game did great in creating specific games, music and characters relationships. Now the negatives. Squid Game did terribly in doing the layout of story. There are many unrealistic moments just to keep the important characters alive. Story can be chaotic and you can get easily lost. Ending of 1st season is terrible and unrealistic. You will just look at it and wonder how could someone come up with this nonsense. Squid Game is little bit overhyped show. Its not bad and I really enjoyed many parts but that storywriting, oh boy.,If you’ve seen Asian game shows or TV challenge competitions; you know how wacky they can be. This Korean series goes a step further. A group of people who have extreme debts are whisked away to an undisclosed location for a series of trials and competitions. If they win, they get big bucks, but losers are killed. I’ll confess that I fast forwarded thru some of the character dialogue scenes. They really weren’t that interesting, plus the perilous situations provide the fun and in later episodes the violence. This international phenomena is certainly unique, but more a curiosity for the weirdness than any kind of important drama. (Nine 45-minute episodes in Korean with subtitles or dubbed in English),Its not bad, Just over-rated. I think that people everywhere have been saying that this show is one of the best shows ever made and I think I would have to dissagre. Its not bad but its not all that.,Squid Game is of the Puzzle-Adventure-Mystery-Survival-Drama genre. This is a plot type that has been used many times and recently in Asian films.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line: I\\'ll watch season 2 if it is developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acting ranges from good to not-good. The writing is good accept the basic premise of the plot seems somewhat contrived and not believable. The \"games\" may feel silly and not believable. The VIP characters seemed badly developed with poor acting - in my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirecting, editing and other technicals are of professional quality. Casting seemed mostly appropriate. Squid Game is a film series that you don\\'t appreciate until the last episode. If you only watch the first view episodes you will not be able to appreciate what it has to offer. Take that into consideration as many film reviewers only watch the beginning of films.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the English language audio dubs were not good. I do not speak Korean - but, after the second episode I used the original Korean audio track (with English subtitles) and found the acting much more enjoyable. If you are American and if you are not familiar with Korean, you may find the long-vowel sounds that Koreans use for emphasis to be annoying - but, there is less of that in the later episodes and your ear will attenuate after a few episodes. The social commentary was relevant - in my opinion. Many years ago I listened to a radio talk show involving personal debt crisis. People\\'s lives had been destroyed by credit card debt, student loan debt, spending too much on their car and spending too much on their home, etc. The host of the radio program would help people put together a plan to drastically reduce their spending (often by selling their \"luxury car\" and sometimes by selling their home) and pay off their debts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a lot of over the top, over-speculation in the symbolism within this film. The director has been clear that symbolism (involving the colors of red and blue, for example) were not his intent.,One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is \"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children\\'s games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake\". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother\\'s card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the same can\\'t be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don\\'t feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game. Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.,Squid game is a very entertaining show that surprises viewers with fun twists and interesting, intense characters. You can tell the writers spent a lot of time putting the story and world together with lots of little details and storylines. Having said that, it\\'s not a perfect show and does suffer from some cliches and strange character choices.,Great sound track in the show. Everything else is pretty mediocre. Average at best writing, tons of huge plot holes, and awful English voice over for English speaking characters (I watched the show in Korean). First three episodes were pretty good but then it\\'s downhill from there and fast. Last episode was quite terrible. All-in-all this is just a Battle Royale rip-off with extra steps.,Some episodes are absolute masterpieces, but the last episode is absolute trash and it is even worse when the writer of this show says he does not want a second season but wrote a open ending and did not finish the show with a clear ending which feels it is really over and the story is finished, but that was not the case, very strange.,I think there may be a cultural misunderstanding here with the show for us western audience. The reason I say this is because the way some of the characters act is very annoying and pathetic. People don\\'t act in this fashion in our societies. I understand it is a tv show, but it still is over to top emotional acting. Nonetheless, there are plenty of logical fallacies and plot holes, but there are some good portions too. 5/10.,No show or movie has made me feel this many emotions in a long time and for that, screw you, Hollywood! This is how you write a show! Flawed characters with relatable goals! We interpret the story and apply any lessons learned to our own lives. No woke or political agendas shoved down our throats.,Obra maestra, los mejores personajes en muchos años, tanto en cine como en formato serie,It is the best series I have watched after Game of Thrones. It is really entertaining series that you want to watch twice.,There was a new Korean series on Netflix and I didn\\'t really care. But it didn\\'t take long before I started hearing about it from all sides, and only in a good way. So I decided to watch this series and I don\\'t regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn\\'t take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children\\'s games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn\\'t anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it.,It\\'s an entertaining series, but the hype doesn\\'t justify it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout going into spoiler:\\r\\n- Most of the characters (both players and the rest) didn\\'t have any depth or impact throughout the story;\\r\\n- Being an oriental series, I expected a stronger social critique that would leave us thinking (like Parasite movie);\\r\\n- Argument with lots of plot holes (probably, they will use some of these holes to fill season 2);\\r\\n- The games themselves were entertaining, but lack a psychological impact and the outcomes were obvious and predictable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the controversy regarding its violence, those who were bothered by this series, never saw the Japanese movie Battle Royale (much more disturbing and violent) https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266308/ or other movies (eg: Saw, Tarantino movies, Hunger Games...).,Squid game is an entertaining series with a great plot and a lot of scenes that kept you watching.,It is a very ordinary and mediocre series that has been exaggerated too much. Despite some interesting sequences and a relatively good plot, but with a repetitive idea and ignoring the exaggerations and meaningless sequences that were made just for excitement, there is no point in considering this work a masterpiece \\u200c . The good thing about the series is that it is fun while not vulgar.,I beleive this TV series is hardly a normal one. It also has some illogical concepts and sequences like \"scanning masks in order to uphold security\".,Squid Game: Season 1 offers an exciting character-driven drama, but is unable to avoid some filler content.,Dark and different, disconnected and connected, Squid Game makes one really wonder about the \"human\" \"race\". Totally dystopian, it has an interesting plot and good characterization. The acting is flawless.\\r\\nEnjoyable even if one doesn\\'t like dark dramas.,This series just doesn\\'t live up to the hype. I really wanted to like Squid Game. As someone who is a big fan of solid Korean cinema (Parasite, Mother, Old Boy, Memories of Murder), I was intrigued by a TV series that had generated so much buzz and promised to be violent and dark. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, I was disappointed because the plot was nothing new. We\\'ve seen the same basic premise in dozens of other movies and TV shows that have come before it. Second, with the exceptions of Lee Jung-Jae and Park Hae-Soo. But even their decent performances couldn\\'t save a show in which the majority of the acting is something that belongs either in a daytime soap opera, the characters are one-dimensional caricatures, and the dialogue is overwhelmingly cliche. In fact, the acting is so over the top and melodramatic that I repeatedly found myself laughing at moments that were meant to be tragic, depressing, or shocking. The trophy for bad-acting, however, should go to the foreigners who were hired as English-speaking actors to play the roles of VIP clients. I\\'ve seen better acting in elementary school plays, and that is not hyperbole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, if you\\'re into cheap plot twists, and you know that you enjoy other Korean dramas that ooze melodrama and hackneyed tropes, then this might be up your alley. If you\\'re someone who takes TV and film seriously, though, then you should skip it.,There were logic errors from time to time but end of all chapters were intriguing and surprising.I really liked,This series on Netflix is filed with needless violence and death. For what? There is nothing to enjoy while watching. It is stressful and unnecessary. I thought this types of “entertainment” fizzled out back in the 2000s with Saw, Hostel, and Hunger Games, but it looks like it is coming back. At least Hunger Games wasn’t as bad as Squid Game. Why this series caught on I will never understand.,Una de las mejores series originales de Netflix, si es que no es la mejor. Aplaudible guion, impresionante e innovadora trama, personajes entrañables, actuaciones impecables. Una serie atrapante que mantiene al espectador con cara de preocupación y asombro en cada momento. Un balance perfecto entre drama y suspenso, sin escenas de sexo innecesarias o puestas a la fuerzas. Es de felicitar y ovacionar con entusiasta fervor el magnánimo trabajo hecho por el guionista y también director por esta obra maestra de la televisión.,Literally cannot pick a single flaw in this show. Second best series I\\'ve ever watched behind Breaking Bad. The whole show is basically a masterclass on plot twists and character development.,Pues no está mal, es entretenida, pero sobrevalorada más allá de cualquier límite.,One of the greatest shows ever made. I believe it is absolutely flawless. The characters, the screenplay, the plot, the pacing, the drama, the horror. Bravo,Definitely the best spent time procrastinating. I don’t even think I’ll be able to get this show out of my head for at least a month.,It cannot avoid the similarities to other different works, even aesthetically, but I was entertained.\\r\\nBit overlong and repetitive but still ok.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems to be having a good reception and will probably have a second season.\\r\\nI don\\'t see the point of it, because either they repeat the same concept, which would be very boring, or they change the idea of the original story, which also defeats the purpose of what it made it appealing in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can watch it on Netflix.,Squid Game is the type of show you might sleep on when you read the description or see that it is a non english show. Do not sleep on Squid Game.\\r\\n\\r\\nSquid game is a survival thriller puzzle drama comedy. The show jumps from thought provoking social drama to comedic or thriller moments flawlessly. This is helped by a trope of believable characters expertly portrayed by talented actors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s because of these actors that I highly recommend watching with subtitles. Not doing so will numb the impeccable comedic timing of the shows lead or the raw and contagious kindness of my favorite character Ali. If you like bloody fun, this show has it in spades, or triangles, or whatever symbol you want to put on the cards this show plays. There is more death than you may be comfortable with. But the deaths are rarely gratuitous. They are quick to the point deaths, save a few unlucky players. However, do expect plenty of blood and guns. I consider myself to be a picky person when it comes to shows, which is why I was so shocked to love Squid Game. Best show of the year so far.,As the classic said - This series is STUPID **** STUPID ****.\\r\\nI didn’t burn with Russian vyser as much as with the stupidity of this mishandled series.\\r\\nThe characters in this series are simply amazing with their stupidity, their actions and phrases are often illogical.\\r\\nthe branch with the policeman is just **** a whole branch of one of the main characters just evaporated (Bondarchuk\\'s gun?).\\r\\nthe result of all his actions is my leading brother.\\r\\nand ... what and why and why? what\\'s next? what about your call to the cops and the sent photo video? nothing.\\r\\non the basis of the film, we are given names several times. who say absolutely nothing to the audience. although this moment is exposed as if the viewer should experience a shock. and one of the series ends just at the fact that we were called SOME UNKNOWN NAME. and the next episode starts by putting the dick on it. **** this move!\\r\\nThe protagonist is a dumb, disgusting, hysterical, spineless idiot.\\r\\nwhich in the end gives out such crap that you feel ashamed.\\r\\n1 - A WHOLE YEAR, for a whole year he simply does nothing. took 10,000 won and that\\'s it. What about creditors and debts? but nothing he just walks and drinks, continuing to borrow money ... mmm ...\\r\\n2 - meeting an old man cannot listen and understand what he says to him, continues to be hysterical and angry.\\r\\n3 - he seems to appreciate and feel sorry for his friends, but he also scored a year for their requests. Well, the type of FSUs I\\'m sad because of you, but I will not do at least something for you. even vloooom and generally I\\'m depressed.\\r\\n4 - friends, it\\'s time to do what I promised you! and our hero just shoots two birds with one stone with a genius move ... took the child, how? just? the documents? legal procedure?\\r\\nso after that he also shags it off to the old woman, it\\'s okay, you just take the child from the orphanage and just shake it off to the old woman. look after him ... two decades.\\r\\n5 - having soaped up to fly away, he meets a man that he invited to the game and in a rage runs after him, WHAT IS A **** ?! for what? ask something? you ****ing talked to the FOUNDER AND HE TOLD YOU WHAT FOR WHY but you\\'re too stupid to listen. to kick it off? um ... first of all, that dude that you defended had the only chance, you yourself voluntarily returned to the game. FOR GOOD WILL. knowing what is happening there and what you are going for. could just give this dude some money or tell him what\\'s there. but there is no GG in the old fashioned way, just hysterical and that\\'s it ...\\r\\n6 - here they show us again that he is on the plane and has almost flew to the usa and happy end, enjoy life next to your daughter and make sure that all this is not in vain.\\r\\nBUT NO, this is a weakling solution.\\r\\nlet me call back these **** from the game (for a second it looks like one of the most influential people in at least that area) and say TOBY PUSSA FLOW WITH THE CITY!\\r\\nYOUR MOTHER LIKE YOU STUPID!\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually I stay away from what is unheated, for me this is a sign that this is SELECT **** and it is better to stay away. but once, guided by this method, I missed a series that became my favorite, breaking bad. and so I thought, okay, let\\'s see, mb ... people were not mistaken.\\r\\nGod, how wrong I was ...\\r\\ndecided to see what kind of score on the metacritic, mb do people also feel cheated? no 7.6 on metcriticism ...\\r\\nAnd then I remember J. Karlin - PEOPLE PZDTS WHAT STUPID,Totally worth it. It is one of the best narratives I have seen in years. Of course, you have to watch it in Korean to really appreciate the acting.,If you put Joon-ho Bong, David Fincher and John Carpenter in a blender, and added a heaping helping of Battle Royale, you have an idea behind the look and the themes of Squid Game. Desperate characters are looking to better their lives by surviving \"kids games\" with a lethal twist, in a chance to be awarded a life changing fortune. The beauty of the production design, from the Eisher inspired stairways of the game complex, the bright candy colored game arenas, to the grungy Korean cityscape, is f\\'n brilliant. And of course it\\'s brutally violent. Lives are obstacles to be beaten (ahem, killed) to survive the game. There is one sequence I must mention. The honeycomb game is paced and edited brilliantly. Switching from character to character, showing different techniques and strategies. A master class in wringing tension and suspense. Afterward I paused and noticed the time remaining at the start of the \"ten minute\" sequence and the end. It timed out to ten minutes in real time to the second. Again. BRILLIANT.,Great and very deep show. Of course there are a lot of haters giving the show low ratings, they don\\'t like the truth. And the truth is Squid Game is an excellent distillation of how predatory capitalism works.,Do they have to scream in every scene?! Like, all the time??? (The \"Fly Me to the Moon\" cover is good, though.),It\\'s a pretty decent netflix show, but honestly, i think it\\'s kinda overrated.,If North Korea gives a show two thumbs up, (https://www.indiewire.com/2021/10/squid-game-north-korea-salutes-critique-south-korea-1234671661/#!)\\r\\n\\r\\nthen one should be morally obligated to give it two thumbs down.,A fairly basic storyline with some average to very poor acting. However the character development was decent in some cases, and it maintained a level of interest throughout.,jgkyukjhkuyjktugkjuyjktugyjutyjtuyjujghghjghjtuyjunj6y7ututytyut7666ghfghhg,Squid game is a fenomenal show with a lot of excitement. The plot is a very good idea and worked out good. The only disappointment is the VIP\\'s terrible acting. They were kind of funny though.,The show is great if you want to sleep. There\\'s one or two unusual plots, but in general it\\'s more generic than I imagined. Honestly, I only recommend it if you\\'re looking to see deaths, and it\\'s still worth another compilation. This grade was because I didn\\'t have 4,5...,Starts strong, interesting premise. Not recommend for the faint of heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American VIPs were incredibly douchey and cringey. (who talks like that?)\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat voice acting. Subs > dubs. Plot gets more formulaic as it drags on. I\\'m not that excited for the sequel.,Squid Game is an overrated series. The series is based only on the brutal games presented and the situations submitted to the characters. Character development is poorly worked, actuations, personalities and dialogues are artificial and silly, the story is very simple, the conflict has easy solutions, some actions end up repeating so much that we can predict future events and the outcome is unnecessary. While these flaws exist, I admit that there are positive points, albeit few. We can cite, for example, photography, which combines the intention of brutal childrens games, and the soundtrack.,It\\'s interesting! Holy cow what a novel concept. There is a lot of criticism I\\'m seeing about missing out on statements about social inequities. Who cares. Squid Game is cool. Exists in it\\'s own world and does so with depth, emotion, and decent acting. It\\'s also brutal and unflinching in that brutality which will turn a lot of people off. Love it or hate it, it doesn\\'t care about what moral conundrum you were hoping it would solve; the first flagstone of a decent creative concept.,Entertaining and fun show, let down by mediocre writing and annoying, simplistic characters.,It\\'s rare that I enjoy a new show these days and this one really shows and ended up being really good.\\r\\nOutside of a few nitpicks I ended up getting more into finding Easter Eggs and rewatching episodes in both English and Korean voices. Definitely love the tone of the show and the cast they chose for it.,The dialogs are poor, the story is kind nonsense but somehow you want to see the games that are the only good part of the game,Un mélange de Koh Lanta, d’Intervilles (mais sans la vachette) et de Battle Royale impromptue dans cette série coréenne indéniablement percutante et fort brutale puisqu’au fil des jeux (d’une cruauté souvent sans précédent), les perdants quittent définitivement la partie… avec une balle dans la tête. Les autres survivront jusqu’à la prochaine épreuve et il n’en restera qu’un ou qu’une pour remporter le pactole !\\r\\n\\r\\nUne série très bien réalisée et de temps en temps cyniquement drôle mais aussi une critique sociale de la Corée du sud contemporaine qui a subi elle aussi les effets de la crise économique avec ses laissés pour compte, sur le carreau, endettés jusqu’au cou, perdus pour la société et prêts à tout pour faire du fric…\\r\\n\\r\\nLeurs motivations sont diverses, leurs parcours sont variés, allant du criminel endurci au col blanc poursuivi pour fraude en passant ici et là néanmoins par pas mal de clichés ambulants, il faut bien le dire aussi. Toutefois, la guimauve (qui peut être exacerbée dans nombre de productions coréennes) s’avère ici assez contenue, presque sobre si j’ose dire.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn peut regretter également quelques facilités dans le scénario, notamment tout ce qui concerne le flic à dire vrai… mais on a vu pire en la matière. Enfin, l’agenda migratoire inséré de force ici est tout à fait regrettable avec l’un des participants, un immigré pakistanais particulièrement attardé ! (on aura tout vu, franchement…!).\\r\\n\\r\\nCela étant dit, et en attendant une seconde saison (la fin de la première restant ouverte), on ne peut que saluer ce Koh Lanta impitoyable bien mené et spectaculaire : du beau boulot pour l’instant !,A cultural phenomenon and such a unique experience - I\\'m gonna miss this show and the feeling I got watching it for the first time. I\\'m still reeling from that ending (the last two episodes really)... This show just ripped my heart out, made me obsessed with its main concept and characters... and yeah, I\\'m just stunned and kind of devastated by how it ended. This one\\'s gonna stick with me for a long time... definitely one of the most memorable, impactful shows I\\'ve watched in a long time.,Невероятный корейский феномен, покоривший весь мир! Посмотрел на одном дыхании и за один день!,This show borders on torture porn (some would say it crosses that border), but the story is injected with enough humanity to bring it above a mere exercise in blood-spattered special FX. If you don\\'t like the sight of blood, steer clear because there is a LOT of blood/murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe games largely put players in the position of having to make morality choices -- this is clearly what the show wants you to think about. While I appreciate the effort, there just isn\\'t enough nuance in the characters and the choices they\\'re forced to make to elevate this above a run-of-the-mill morality tale, and the rivers of blood drag the effort down. I did find a couple of moments genuinely moving, but only a couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, SG does a good job of piquing the viewer\\'s curiosity regarding what the heck the whole twisted exercise is for. However, the resolution of season 1 rings hollow; the scene with the reveal feels very contrived. The explanation for the whole sociopathic, bat-**** crazy endeavor doesn\\'t make much sense unless you accept that all the parties involved are, well... bat-**** crazy sociopaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\'re merely looking to satisfy whatever torture porn craving you may have, this will likely satisfy. If you want believable story with nuanced, thought-provoking dilemmas, this is passable, but not a must-see.,Not bad tv show. Soundtrack, costumes and decorations (except for \"paintings on the walls\") are good. The detective side-plotline (which included organ trade and VIP plotlines) damaged the plot, but still characters and the actors pull out the series.,This has been a really decent watch, even though in almost every way it reminds me a lot of Kaiji(same concept , ideas) but with different games. I like how elegant every scene is made from the games to the normal character interactions. Most of the games were fine and the actors did a great job. One of my issues with this is the ending. They could have stopped it at a perfect time(mother scene) but for some reason they decided to roll for another 20 minutes or so showing us a very unsatisfying and quiet stupid plot twist that actually ruins a lot of parts from the previous episodes. The bad guys acting was also pretty bad and their dialogue did not sound decent. Overall if it wasn\\'t for that crappy ending and twist it could have been way better.,Atmosphere is the name of the game for Squid Game. Depressing, unsettling, uncomfortable, all of these atmospheres make their way halfway out of the screen into your own mind as you think about the situations the characters are being put in. It\\'s hard to attach yourself to any character when you know what bums they are, yet also find it hard to warrant anybody losing because the consequences aren\\'t equal to their actions. Beside the first major plot twist, the rest of the twists are thrown at you all at once in the final episode. This isn\\'t to say there aren\\'t other twists of course, just not those crucial to the main plot. Each episode is a new experience, and they did a great job of periodically adding fresh ideas while still making the show and atmosphere feel familiar. Being only about 8 hours long, Squid Game is well worth the time.,Série bacana, com enredo curioso, aguardando a nova temporada. Vale a pena assistir!,It\\'s quite astonishing to see that Netflix, which isn\\'t known for making good and engaging productions, has put this out. This is a series that kept me on the edge of my seat for almost the entire runtime, sure, it\\'s stretched out a bit too long here and there and the English and German dubs are godawful, but I was still surprised in a positive way by this gem Netflix has been able to make\\r\\n\\r\\nI still DON\\'T want a second season of this, though.,an unoriginal idea stretched so thin they can\\'t justify it by the final few episodes.\\r\\nnone of the socioeconomic ideas that are touched on in this are fleshed out, and character motivations are usually skin deep.\\r\\nJust terrible shallow writing and none of the visuals are anything special.\\r\\nI think this show may have been written to sell jumpsuits,An incredible series. Such a level of tension and interest has not been caused for a long time by TV series and, in principle, everything that has been in pop culture for a long time. Applause for the creators!,Took a few episodes for me to be hooked in, but when I finally was, it took off. From loving a character to absolutely hating them, this show made you feel. This being my first Korean show watch, I will never regret it. Episode 6, tears galore.,Increíble para dormir.\\r\\nFotografía genial. Diálogos pobres. Guion mediocre. Típica serie de moda que sube como la espuma y olvidas al mes siguiente.,Very predictable. It\\'s like Brazilian \"3%\" and Spain \"Mind Heist\" in one project.

Entiendo perfectamente que lo fuera, pero viéndola ahora, con la cabeza más fría, está muy bien, pero no, no es para taaanto, aún así, se merece los elogios.,Naprawdę średni serial, nie rozumiem hype\\'u na niego, moim zdaniem o wiele lepsze jest chociaż arcane od Riotu, bądź klasyczny Rick and Morty,It\\'s a fantastic series, engaging, brilliant, and horribly tense, which here in Brazil is much admired.,excellent\\r\\n[ ek-suh-luhnt ]\\r\\n\\r\\nadjective\\r\\npossessing outstanding quality or superior merit; remarkably good.,Acting is ok,Nice scenes but ending is weird,overall its a bit overrated but good,i give it 8,5/10,Muszę przyznać że dość mile zostałem zaskoczony.

I believe it is absolutely flawless. The characters, the screenplay, the plot, the pacing, the drama, the horror. Bravo\\r\\n1 of 3 users found this helpful12 | Report abuseAll this user\\'s reviews,This Netflix series is one of the best in this platform. The story is revelated episode by episode and proceeding with the episodes the plot makes more and more sense. Every episode make you some suspanse and mistery, with which you reach the end of the series in a blink of an eye, even if it lasts 9 hours.,not a bad movie indeed, but nothing impresses me at all. there are too many plot holes and character developments are just odd. In conclusion, too much seeding, not recommend at all,The concept felt too simple for me. But the way they show is amazing. Looking forward to the future of soldiers and players.,You know why I gave you such a high score.\\r\\nJust know that \"while satirizing Korean society, it has a narrative that unravels into a game that children enjoyed in Korea,\" and go to Netflix right away to watch it.,What is special about these \"survival games\"? An unusual game of Korean actors, an honest choice (each player came here on their own) and unusual game conditions. Sometimes it gets boring, especially in the last episode, but overall it\\'s an intriguing bloody movie with a motivating humanistic ending.,Squid Game is one of the most exciting TV Series Netflix has to offer. Even though a small number of the audience *might* disagree but the show is as good (not great) as anyone could expect it to be. The story has a lot of potentials to continue for a Second Season, but we\\'ll have to wait and watch how it turns out. Full review at: https://www.theshchronicles.com/post/squid-game,Very addictive to watch. I binge watched it. Only the dubbed version can be a bit weird when it comes to voice lines.,squid game and breaking bad are so far 2 of the only shows that are worth the hype. each episode of squid game was exhilarating and made me forget how much time there was left in the episode and almost jump scared me when the episode ended cause of how into the show i was, its been forever since i\\'ve actually liked a new show. if you\\'re putting off watching it cause of all the crappy tik toks and other videos of it just like i was just don\\'t just watch it, its kinda sad that people meme breaking bad and squid game personally i think the people that meme them have never watched either of the shows before cause how could you watch them and have the audacity to try and make them funny?,I\\'ve seen it before before it was all so caught up. I liked the film. I liked the underlying content even more. I\\'m looking forward to the second season, but I don\\'t like that since it\\'s been picked up everyone is talking about it. Of course it\\'s not the film\\'s fault.,One of the best series i have every watched! It gives you suspense, drama and exciting moments. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. The characters are well established, the performances are exceptional. Please do watch it!,one of the most enjoyable and engaging TV shows i\\'ve ever watched in my entire lifetime.some people may point out that the plot is not fully original which is true but it still works awesomely in my opinion.the games (which is the main part of the show) always accomplish its task, managing to be both fun to watch and thrilling at the same time.,///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////,I\\'ve seen it multiple times, and I still enjoy it. It\\'s very emotional. I would recommend anyone watch it if you think you\\'re into these kinds of shows.,Simply a production of the highest level that inserts Korea as a power in the cultural industry. Excellent photography, outstanding characters, well-chosen cast, fantastic story, with a critique of liberal democracy. In my view, the main key to understanding the production and which I don\\'t usually read in the reviews is that the viewer at the end wants the game to continue in a continuation of the series, that is, you and I are perverse just like the financiers and gamblers who entertain themselves by watching these deadly games.,I liked watching this series. I like series about blood and secrets. And of course, a happy and not a happy ending.,What will you do for money? is the main idea of Squid Game. Netflix\\'s global hit is well-deserving, but is not \\'perfect\\', hopefully we can get more answers in S2.,The show slowly ramps up to a steady mid level of tension, then plateaus until the end where that level just completely tanks. Without giving spoilers, if you enjoy things wrapping up nicely, with solid writing, few loose ends (or at least loose ends with meaning), a sense of meaning for all the tension you held throughout your viewing, and a sense of rationale/logical conclusions for why things came to be or why certain elements were included... you\\'re in for disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of this, the three big bad monsters that come for people, look like Grimaces with more defined limbs and covered in tar. They\\'re neither intimidating in look, nor do their visuals connect to the imagery one would conjure up when thinking of \"hell\". Additionally, they\\'re design, animation, and compositing appears amateurish and rushed. The characters are frustrating at best. Their introductions tend to be forced/rushed, their motives and struggles generic, and their resolve disappointingly anticlimactic. Enough time was already thrown away watching this slow car crash of a series and writing this much about said car crash, so in conclusion, this series could have easily been turned around with more competent writers and designers/animators. For now it\\'s not worth wasting away your time and energy to consume this poor attempt of a project, especially when considering that the \"creators\" seem to have put in the bare minimum effort into this production.,This show is quite good. The premise is fairly original and it is a good thriller. Great camera work. The special effects for the most part are good with a few rough spots. Overall check this show out. It isn\\'t quite at the level of squid game but it is right below it and it is definitely worth watching. I consider the show a solid 8 maybe even an 8.5,Massively overhyped nonsense. CGI is fairly poor quality. Storyline isn\\'t great and the characters aren\\'t very engaging. I wouldn\\'t recommend this, and certainly wouldn\\'t compare it to squid game!,Big surprise of the year, ‘Hellbound’ breaks several barriers, exposes the worst of humanity, ending its first season in a glorious and dark way. A work of the highest level.,First season itself is a bit too fragmented. But still very thrilling. High expectations on season 2 to bring it back together.,This series was a waste of potential. Intriguing premise but squandered with a weak script, shock value, and a barrage of disturbing imagery and behavior. Presents humanity at its worth to the point of absurdity.,Quelle bizarrerie que cette série qui semble par bien des aspects sans queue ni tête… je me demande si une seconde saison viendra éclaircir certains points cruciaux et donner au moins quelques tentatives d’explications…\\r\\n\\r\\nEn l’état, on a pour l’instant droit à des « démonstrations » fort réussies au demeurant, des exécutions sommaires d’une rare violence qui ne sont pas sans évoquer celles qu’on affectionnait en place publique au Moyen Age… Et vu qu’elles sont précédées d’avertissements qui mentionnent expressément aux intéressés qu’ils iront « aux enfers » à l’heure prévue (jamais de retard, toujours ponctuels les bourreaux…) une panique mystique s’installe rapidement au sein de la population.\\r\\n\\r\\nComme au Moyen Age, une secte prend le relais et une quasi-dictature religieuse s’installe… pour suivre au mieux la volonté de « Dieu » ! on suit en tout cax avec intérêt ces 6 épisodes, toujours curieux de voir et constater jusqu’où ça va aller… une sorte d’épilogue appelle encore d’autres questions supplémentaires mais je crains que les scénaristes stagiaires ne s’en sortiront pas avec un tel foutoir.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignalons que les comédiens et comédiennes sont tout à fait convaincants et pour certains, bien cinglés et outranciers dans leurs réactions (le fanatisme…) ; mais signalons également que dans l’action (assez rare cependant) tout est filmé caméra à l’épaule, ce qui est, on s’en doute, très désagréable. Mais bon, pour le moment, attendons la suite… de ce délire… infernal !,I was looking forward to seeing this. I made it partway through Episode 3. I was OK with the monsters eviscerating a seemingly innocent mother of 2. The incineration of a man while he was still alive, with the accompanying thrashing around in the oven\\'s window was pretty disturbing. But when they pulled a character\\'s 67 year old terminally ill mother from a van and beat her to death with baseball bats while her daughter watched, I had enough. I watched Squid Game and that it was thought-provoking, even when it was violent. This went way beyond that and I would recommend that people stay away.,Один из самых тупых сериалов. Никаких объяснений, одна глупость героев, сюжета и абсолютно неинтересные персонажи.,It\\'s zombie series onto the next level. This zombie series are positioned differently from others in the past, and it\\'s refreshing to watch. I like how it incorporates today\\'s pandemic scenario and protocol into this show. It makes a lot of sense and after all it\\'s about virus. The show also has a main villain, the boss, that is unusual and unique. Each episode is a story gripping. Characters are well developed and each of them are unique individuals. Their interactions are very interesting to watch especially when they are all kept getting stuck in a confined space and trying to figure out how to escape. Consequently that is when their deep personalities reveal. There are many other supporting characters that are uniquely told and developed. This show is like mix bags of Escape Room, World War Z, Resident Evil and one other popular movie (don\\'t want to spoil). Surprisingly this show is actually based on a Webtoon, Korean online graphic novel. That\\'s how good this is for it to be converted into live action. It has high potential for season 2 like Squid Game but somehow it has better and thorough ending (can be stand alone without season 2) and it doesn\\'t leave you hanging like Squid Game. Highly recommended. It\\'s absolutely entertaining to watch. Just don\\'t overly analyze things and after all it\\'s just fictional show,It\\'s such a blessing that this series is 12 episodes long. I almost binged it and it left me wanting for more and now wish I could forget it and watch again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan, this series was cast really nicely and there\\'s almost every single stereotypical student/adult archetype you can think of. Each actor/actress played their role so well and it was really well acted. There\\'s a ton of action, even more gore, with enough humour to separate it from other zombie series, with the added bonus of undertones that permeates through to the real world like how unforgiving the world can be, how we treat one another in times of crisis, what we can choose to do when every moment there\\'s the possibility of death, and so on. No episode felt like filler, and with 12 episodes there\\'s a lot of time to flesh out characters and the plot nicely. My favourite characters are Dae-su, Su-hyeok, Mijin and Jae-Ik. Dae-su and Mijin are priceless. Certain characters have such relatable personalities. Don\\'t think anyone was \\'annoying\\' at all. Music is okay-good but the sound effects are *chef\\'s kiss*. Take a shot for every character you think will make it but did not, in the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t \"reinvent the wheel\" or anything like that but it damn sure was more than entertaining and while the ending didn\\'t close off with a bang, it definitely laid the foundations for the 2nd season and I\\'m all for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot gonna lie this series should be rated higher, I feel. There\\'s a lot of eye candy actors and actresses too so there\\'s that. Watch it, NOW. It\\'s a nice stress reliever and you gotta hand it to the Koreans; they know how to do the zombie subgenre. It\\'s a nice ride, you just gotta get on and enjoy it. Netflix spared no expense and it showed. The practical effects were superb.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbsolutely love this series, definitely one of the best ones I\\'ve ever watched. It\\'s fun-tastic. Netflix, second season ASAP, please :),This is a amazing show, alot of action, twist and turns. I really thinkthis deserves a 10/10.,Encore une série sur les zombis, ça commence à bien faire ! sauf qu’il s’agit ici d’une série coréenne sensiblement différente dans son approche et surtout bien meilleure que toutes les séries américaines réunies sur le sujet… on me dira que ce n’est pas si difficile étant donné la nullité des productions d’outre-atlantique à cet égard mais tout de même…\\r\\n\\r\\nL’approche est bien sûr très inspirée de l’excellent film « Dernier Train pour Busan » avec par exemple des zombis qui courent très vite… mais l’épidémie a pour épicentre un grand lycée qui va devenir un gigantesque champ de bataille, de massacre et… de survie !\\r\\n\\r\\nC’est souvent drôle par son ironie mordante et souvent spectaculaire (les effets spéciaux sont très réussis) ; la réalisation est impressionnante, étonnamment soignée et carrément digne des meilleurs films à gros budget. Les personnages sont bien caractérisés et leur parcours permet de mettre en lumière les graves problèmes du harcèlement scolaire et la dureté de l’enseignement si l’on veut espérer intégrer une université…\\r\\n\\r\\nMais nos lycéens ont rapidement d’autres chats à fouetter, notamment des hordes de zombis à dérouiller… et parfois à tuer, car le zombi coréen est beaucoup plus brutal, retors et difficile à tuer que le zombi américain. Cela étant, la série reprend à son compte tous les clichés du genre : la survie impitoyable, les gentils et les salopards, les traîtres et les lâches… et tutti quanti.\\r\\n\\r\\nMais le rythme reste toujours très élevé sur les 12 épisodes d’une heure chacun en moyenne et on reste happé d’un bout à l’autre, du début à la fin. Les rebondissements tiennent globalement la route, sauf vers la fin, une fin qui appelle sans doute une suite… mais bon, on verra bien. Quelques choix scénaristiques étonnent (le père puis le militaire par exemple) tandis que les romances font décidément très « manga »… dans ce lycée coréen qui a tout d’un lycée… japonais !\\r\\n\\r\\nPar ailleurs, si la guimauve peut sembler maladroite, elle reste de bien meilleure qualité que ce qu’on peut voir dans les séries hollywoodiennes, notamment ces merdes comme les Walking Dead et dérivés. Quoi qu’il en soit, une excellente série coréenne de plus dont on attend la prochaine saison avec impatience !,I\\'m a sucker for these zombie movies and shows. They always manage to pull me into watching it. Korea somehow manages to make zombies more interesting compared to western movies and shows. For example, Train to Busan was absolutely stellar. My hope was that this show was on the level of that movie. So does Korea deliver another excellent zombie action or is it a big miss?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s get the obvious out of the way first, the zombie action is indeed exciting to watch. There are some exciting and creative sequences in this show such as the dining hall sequence which is filmed like one shot. There are some other creative sequences such as one involving a fight between two individuals on top of bookcases while zombies are underneath. Another is where the characters build a giant wall to hold off zombies while they escape the other way. Another is where they create a circular wall while getting from point A to B. All these sequences feel very original and I certainly enjoyed watching them. I also have to give a lot of praise to the makeup artist as the zombies look frighteningly good. The zombie actors also do a good job as well in making them feel inhuman and unnatural. The zombies here are definitely quite scary and that is quite a feat considering how oversaturated zombies are in media.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actors all do a phenomenal job in their portrayal. They all manage to give their characters distinct personalities even if they are just minor characters. The actors who die and become zombies also do a great job as zombies. The story is also quite engaging despite just being mostly about surviving. The story focuses on the dynamic and relationship of the surviving school students. We see them work together but also argue and fight but it never feels over the top or anything. What the story does the best is in delivering on the emotions and there is definitely some emotional stuff. We also got a more interesting origin for the virus that is also quite sympathetic and we got some special zombies that give the situation more spice to it. They also spend a fair amount of time with the military in the series to give the audience an understanding of their response to the virus. There is also quite a bit of romance in this and it surprisingly works well despite the situation not being the exact best for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a lot of characters in this show and honestly maybe too many. The show doesn\\'t just focus on one group of survivors and instead multiple groups which lead to a lot of characters to pay attention to. What can be annoying is that a fair amount of these characters have nothing interesting to them but the series still spends a fair amount of time on them. If a character doesn\\'t have an interesting backstory or personality then they are probably going to die which results in predictable deaths. There are also some characters that are just in the series for no reason such as a streamer that I felt added nothing to the plot apart from taking screen time away from actual interesting characters. Additionally, there are so many moments in this series where a character makes a really stupid decision that is frustrating to watch. Also, the characters not going for the head is a big annoyance. It also gets annoying when some characters stand around instead of helping their friend who is being attacked. The series is also a bit too long and can feel a bit exhausting to watch. It is 12 episodes but after watching, it definitely felt like the series could at least be cut down by 2 episodes. There is a lot of sequences where it does just feel like they are padding for time. For example, we will have scenes where we watch characters stand around or just building and not talking or a scene where they share chocolate and it all feels too long and pointless. There is a \"villain\" in the show and that person is WAY too overused and gets defeated in the same way like 4 times, to the point that it is kind of laughable. There are also some potentially interesting plot lines that they could\\'ve explored but it is never utilized or explored. There are also some characters that just die for shock value which sucks as it feels like the show would be more interesting if they were kept alive. Overall, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling and exciting zombie show that unfortunately stumbles on all the subplots created. I did come out a little disappointed that they didn\\'t utilize everything the show introduced effectively but it was still a really good time. It does end with a potential tease for season 2 and it might resolve some of the remaining plot threads from season 1. The ending is also quite interesting and it does make me wonder what direction they could go in. Thus I am hopeful for a season 2 despite the show\\'s shortcomings.,Some of the contrivances in this are just insane. Your suspension of disbelief must be at an all-time high to excuse some of the characters ridiculous/poor decisions. That doesn\\'t make it a bad show though. However, it does mean you\\'ll be sat there saying things like: \"Omg would you just close the door behind you ffs\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Omg would you run, run, like seriously! RUN! You have so much time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just tell her! Omg just tell him! Talk to each other ffs!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why are you still standing there? Omg do something!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can no one see that? It\\'s right there, are these people blind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait at the end of the last episode he was about to... How is he... what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if you can ignore all the times you\\'ll feel this way, WHICH WILL BE A LOT, it\\'s an okay zombie show. Initially I was worried about teen angst, I don\\'t like teen drama, its usually boring and revolves around people not saying things that could easily solve 90% of any and all problems. Luckily the show splits its focus from time to time, and we get to see different groups of people dealing with very different situations. It\\'s a good break from the Teen angle and lets us see glimpses of how the world is reacting to this situation. I think if this were written a bit better, with less contrivances, and characters I actually cared about, I could\\'ve given it a higher score.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think if people are overly positive about this it\\'s the whole K-pop vibe people are on... Essentially, anything Korean gets a pass due to pop culture favouritism. Whereas, if people are overly negative, it\\'s potentially due to the cliched teen drama, contrivance filled writing and dumb character decisions that they can\\'t overlook for the sake of entertainment. Look, it\\'s no Kingdom. It\\'s no Train to Busan (THE 1ST ONE OMG that second movie was baaaad). But it\\'s an okay watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, one last thing... Too many episodes.,The show is close to a 10, highly addictive and bingey, not cringey. I am not one of those blindly love everything Korean people but I just found this highly entertaining. Better than Squid Game.,Entertaining for the first half, high intensity zombie drama, but quality decreases and repetitive over time\\r\\n\\r\\nLong spoiler review: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UoVe7XjNZ1Rb_EnaobFVnravtwPnbGU7zspOjuLNvhw/edit?usp=sharing,Very entertaining thrilling\\r\\nSome minor flaws but overall binge worthy\\r\\nReally loved it,I\\'m not a fan of TV series and this one is not exception. althrough i enjoyed this show. Greatly shows human nature and feelings. Scenario is great and actors doing their job just on point too. Has some downsides but generally positive overall. Highly suggested to fans of Train To Busan type zombies, especially it\\'s also korean movie.'"
