      "Squid Game is average show. Average actors, average characters etc. Only reasons why im not voting for 4 is that there are some well made plots and its an original show. Squid game did great in creating specific games, music and characters relationships. Now the negatives. Squid Game did terribly in doing the layout of story. There are many unrealistic moments just to keep the important characters alive. Story can be chaotic and you can get easily lost. Ending of 1st season is terrible and unrealistic. You will just look at it and wonder how could someone come up with this nonsense. Squid Game is little bit overhyped show. Its not bad and I really enjoyed many parts but that storywriting, oh boy.\n",
      "If you’ve seen Asian game shows or TV challenge competitions; you know how wacky they can be. This Korean series goes a step further. A group of people who have extreme debts are whisked away to an undisclosed location for a series of trials and competitions. If they win, they get big bucks, but losers are killed. I’ll confess that I fast forwarded thru some of the character dialogue scenes. They really weren’t that interesting, plus the perilous situations provide the fun and in later episodes the violence. This international phenomena is certainly unique, but more a curiosity for the weirdness than any kind of important drama. (Nine 45-minute episodes in Korean with subtitles or dubbed in English)\n",
      "Its not bad, Just over-rated. I think that people everywhere have been saying that this show is one of the best shows ever made and I think I would have to dissagre. Its not bad but its not all that.\n",
      "Squid Game is of the Puzzle-Adventure-Mystery-Survival-Drama genre. This is a plot type that has been used many times and recently in Asian films.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: I'll watch season 2 if it is developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acting ranges from good to not-good. The writing is good accept the basic premise of the plot seems somewhat contrived and not believable. The \"games\" may feel silly and not believable. The VIP characters seemed badly developed with poor acting - in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Directing, editing and other technicals are of professional quality. Casting seemed mostly appropriate. Squid Game is a film series that you don't appreciate until the last episode. If you only watch the first view episodes you will not be able to appreciate what it has to offer. Take that into consideration as many film reviewers only watch the beginning of films.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the English language audio dubs were not good. I do not speak Korean - but, after the second episode I used the original Korean audio track (with English subtitles) and found the acting much more enjoyable. If you are American and if you are not familiar with Korean, you may find the long-vowel sounds that Koreans use for emphasis to be annoying - but, there is less of that in the later episodes and your ear will attenuate after a few episodes. The social commentary was relevant - in my opinion. Many years ago I listened to a radio talk show involving personal debt crisis. People's lives had been destroyed by credit card debt, student loan debt, spending too much on their car and spending too much on their home, etc. The host of the radio program would help people put together a plan to drastically reduce their spending (often by selling their \"luxury car\" and sometimes by selling their home) and pay off their debts.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a lot of over the top, over-speculation in the symbolism within this film. The director has been clear that symbolism (involving the colors of red and blue, for example) were not his intent.\n",
      "One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is \"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake\". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother's card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don't feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game. Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.\n",
      "Squid game is a very entertaining show that surprises viewers with fun twists and interesting, intense characters. You can tell the writers spent a lot of time putting the story and world together with lots of little details and storylines. Having said that, it's not a perfect show and does suffer from some cliches and strange character choices.\n"

      "Great sound track in the show. Everything else is pretty mediocre. Average at best writing, tons of huge plot holes, and awful English voice over for English speaking characters (I watched the show in Korean). First three episodes were pretty good but then it's downhill from there and fast. Last episode was quite terrible. All-in-all this is just a Battle Royale rip-off with extra steps.\n",
      "Some episodes are absolute masterpieces, but the last episode is absolute trash and it is even worse when the writer of this show says he does not want a second season but wrote a open ending and did not finish the show with a clear ending which feels it is really over and the story is finished, but that was not the case, very strange.\n",
      "I think there may be a cultural misunderstanding here with the show for us western audience. The reason I say this is because the way some of the characters act is very annoying and pathetic. People don't act in this fashion in our societies. I understand it is a tv show, but it still is over to top emotional acting. Nonetheless, there are plenty of logical fallacies and plot holes, but there are some good portions too. 5/10.\n",
      "No show or movie has made me feel this many emotions in a long time and for that, screw you, Hollywood! This is how you write a show! Flawed characters with relatable goals! We interpret the story and apply any lessons learned to our own lives. No woke or political agendas shoved down our throats.\n",
      "Obra maestra, los mejores personajes en muchos años, tanto en cine como en formato serie\n",
      "It is the best series I have watched after Game of Thrones. It is really entertaining series that you want to watch twice.\n",
      "There was a new Korean series on Netflix and I didn't really care. But it didn't take long before I started hearing about it from all sides, and only in a good way. So I decided to watch this series and I don't regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn't anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it.\n",
      "It's an entertaining series, but the hype doesn't justify it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without going into spoiler:\n",
      "- Most of the characters (both players and the rest) didn't have any depth or impact throughout the story;\n",
      "- Being an oriental series, I expected a stronger social critique that would leave us thinking (like Parasite movie);\n",
      "- Argument with lots of plot holes (probably, they will use some of these holes to fill season 2);\n",
      "- The games themselves were entertaining, but lack a psychological impact and the outcomes were obvious and predictable.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the controversy regarding its violence, those who were bothered by this series, never saw the Japanese movie Battle Royale (much more disturbing and violent) https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266308/ or other movies (eg: Saw, Tarantino movies, Hunger Games...).\n",
      "Squid game is an entertaining series with a great plot and a lot of scenes that kept you watching.\n",
      "It is a very ordinary and mediocre series that has been exaggerated too much. Despite some interesting sequences and a relatively good plot, but with a repetitive idea and ignoring the exaggerations and meaningless sequences that were made just for excitement, there is no point in considering this work a masterpiece ‌ . The good thing about the series is that it is fun while not vulgar.\n",
      "I beleive this TV series is hardly a normal one. It also has some illogical concepts and sequences like \"scanning masks in order to uphold security\".\n",
      "Squid Game: Season 1 offers an exciting character-driven drama, but is unable to avoid some filler content.\n",
      "Dark and different, disconnected and connected, Squid Game makes one really wonder about the \"human\" \"race\". Totally dystopian, it has an interesting plot and good characterization. The acting is flawless.\n",
      "Enjoyable even if one doesn't like dark dramas.\n",
      "This series just doesn't live up to the hype. I really wanted to like Squid Game. As someone who is a big fan of solid Korean cinema (Parasite, Mother, Old Boy, Memories of Murder), I was intrigued by a TV series that had generated so much buzz and promised to be violent and dark. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I was disappointed because the plot was nothing new. We've seen the same basic premise in dozens of other movies and TV shows that have come before it. Second, with the exceptions of Lee Jung-Jae and Park Hae-Soo. But even their decent performances couldn't save a show in which the majority of the acting is something that belongs either in a daytime soap opera, the characters are one-dimensional caricatures, and the dialogue is overwhelmingly cliche. In fact, the acting is so over the top and melodramatic that I repeatedly found myself laughing at moments that were meant to be tragic, depressing, or shocking. The trophy for bad-acting, however, should go to the foreigners who were hired as English-speaking actors to play the roles of VIP clients. I've seen better acting in elementary school plays, and that is not hyperbole.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, if you're into cheap plot twists, and you know that you enjoy other Korean dramas that ooze melodrama and hackneyed tropes, then this might be up your alley. If you're someone who takes TV and film seriously, though, then you should skip it.\n",
      "There were logic errors from time to time but end of all chapters were intriguing and surprising.I really liked\n",
      "This series on Netflix is filed with needless violence and death. For what? There is nothing to enjoy while watching. It is stressful and unnecessary. I thought this types of “entertainment” fizzled out back in the 2000s with Saw, Hostel, and Hunger Games, but it looks like it is coming back. At least Hunger Games wasn’t as bad as Squid Game. Why this series caught on I will never understand.\n",
      "Una de las mejores series originales de Netflix, si es que no es la mejor. Aplaudible guion, impresionante e innovadora trama, personajes entrañables, actuaciones impecables. Una serie atrapante que mantiene al espectador con cara de preocupación y asombro en cada momento. Un balance perfecto entre drama y suspenso, sin escenas de sexo innecesarias o puestas a la fuerzas. Es de felicitar y ovacionar con entusiasta fervor el magnánimo trabajo hecho por el guionista y también director por esta obra maestra de la televisión.\n",
      "Literally cannot pick a single flaw in this show. Second best series I've ever watched behind Breaking Bad. The whole show is basically a masterclass on plot twists and character development.\n",
      "Pues no está mal, es entretenida, pero sobrevalorada más allá de cualquier límite.\n",
      "One of the greatest shows ever made. I believe it is absolutely flawless. The characters, the screenplay, the plot, the pacing, the drama, the horror. Bravo\n",
      "Definitely the best spent time procrastinating. I don’t even think I’ll be able to get this show out of my head for at least a month.\n",
      "It cannot avoid the similarities to other different works, even aesthetically, but I was entertained.\n",
      "Bit overlong and repetitive but still ok.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to be having a good reception and will probably have a second season.\n",
      "I don't see the point of it, because either they repeat the same concept, which would be very boring, or they change the idea of the original story, which also defeats the purpose of what it made it appealing in the first place.\n",

The beauty of the production design, from the Eisher inspired stairways of the game complex, the bright candy colored game arenas, to the grungy Korean cityscape, is f'n brilliant. And of course it's brutally violent. Lives are obstacles to be beaten (ahem, killed) to survive the game. There is one sequence I must mention. The honeycomb game is paced and edited brilliantly. Switching from character to character, showing different techniques and strategies. A master class in wringing tension and suspense. Afterward I paused and noticed the time remaining at the start of the \"ten minute\" sequence and the end. It timed out to ten minutes in real time to the second. Again. BRILLIANT.\n",

      "Une série très bien réalisée et de temps en temps cyniquement drôle mais aussi une critique sociale de la Corée du sud contemporaine qui a subi elle aussi les effets de la crise économique avec ses laissés pour compte, sur le carreau, endettés jusqu’au cou, perdus pour la société et prêts à tout pour faire du fric…\n",
      "\n",
      "Leurs motivations sont diverses, leurs parcours sont variés, allant du criminel endurci au col blanc poursuivi pour fraude en passant ici et là néanmoins par pas mal de clichés ambulants, il faut bien le dire aussi. Toutefois, la guimauve (qui peut être exacerbée dans nombre de productions coréennes) s’avère ici assez contenue, presque sobre si j’ose dire.\n",
      "\n",
      "On peut regretter également quelques facilités dans le scénario, notamment tout ce qui concerne le flic à dire vrai… mais on a vu pire en la matière. Enfin, l’agenda migratoire inséré de force ici est tout à fait regrettable avec l’un des participants, un immigré pakistanais particulièrement attardé ! (on aura tout vu, franchement…!).\n",

      "A cultural phenomenon and such a unique experience - I'm gonna miss this show and the feeling I got watching it for the first time. I'm still reeling from that ending (the last two episodes really)... This show just ripped my heart out, made me obsessed with its main concept and characters... and yeah, I'm just stunned and kind of devastated by how it ended. This one's gonna stick with me for a long time... definitely one of the most memorable, impactful shows I've watched in a long time.\n",
      "Невероятный корейский феномен, покоривший весь мир! Посмотрел на одном дыхании и за один день!\n",
      "This show borders on torture porn (some would say it crosses that border), but the story is injected with enough humanity to bring it above a mere exercise in blood-spattered special FX. If you don't like the sight of blood, steer clear because there is a LOT of blood/murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The games largely put players in the position of having to make morality choices -- this is clearly what the show wants you to think about. While I appreciate the effort, there just isn't enough nuance in the characters and the choices they're forced to make to elevate this above a run-of-the-mill morality tale, and the rivers of blood drag the effort down. I did find a couple of moments genuinely moving, but only a couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, SG does a good job of piquing the viewer's curiosity regarding what the heck the whole twisted exercise is for. However, the resolution of season 1 rings hollow; the scene with the reveal feels very contrived. The explanation for the whole sociopathic, bat-**** crazy endeavor doesn't make much sense unless you accept that all the parties involved are, well... bat-**** crazy sociopaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're merely looking to satisfy whatever torture porn craving you may have, this will likely satisfy. If you want believable story with nuanced, thought-provoking dilemmas, this is passable, but not a must-see.\n",
      "Not bad tv show. Soundtrack, costumes and decorations (except for \"paintings on the walls\") are good. The detective side-plotline (which included organ trade and VIP plotlines) damaged the plot, but still characters and the actors pull out the series.\n",
      "This has been a really decent watch, even though in almost every way it reminds me a lot of Kaiji(same concept , ideas) but with different games. I like how elegant every scene is made from the games to the normal character interactions. Most of the games were fine and the actors did a great job. One of my issues with this is the ending. They could have stopped it at a perfect time(mother scene) but for some reason they decided to roll for another 20 minutes or so showing us a very unsatisfying and quiet stupid plot twist that actually ruins a lot of parts from the previous episodes. The bad guys acting was also pretty bad and their dialogue did not sound decent. Overall if it wasn't for that crappy ending and twist it could have been way better.\n",
      "Atmosphere is the name of the game for Squid Game. Depressing, unsettling, uncomfortable, all of these atmospheres make their way halfway out of the screen into your own mind as you think about the situations the characters are being put in. It's hard to attach yourself to any character when you know what bums they are, yet also find it hard to warrant anybody losing because the consequences aren't equal to their actions. Beside the first major plot twist, the rest of the twists are thrown at you all at once in the final episode. This isn't to say there aren't other twists of course, just not those crucial to the main plot. Each episode is a new experience, and they did a great job of periodically adding fresh ideas while still making the show and atmosphere feel familiar. Being only about 8 hours long, Squid Game is well worth the time.\n",
      "Série bacana, com enredo curioso, aguardando a nova temporada. Vale a pena assistir!\n",
      "It's quite astonishing to see that Netflix, which isn't known for making good and engaging productions, has put this out. This is a series that kept me on the edge of my seat for almost the entire runtime, sure, it's stretched out a bit too long here and there and the English and German dubs are godawful, but I was still surprised in a positive way by this gem Netflix has been able to make\n",
      "\n",
      "I still DON'T want a second season of this, though.\n",
      "an unoriginal idea stretched so thin they can't justify it by the final few episodes.\n",
      "none of the socioeconomic ideas that are touched on in this are fleshed out, and character motivations are usually skin deep.\n",
      "Just terrible shallow writing and none of the visuals are anything special.\n",
      "I think this show may have been written to sell jumpsuits\n",
      "An incredible series. Such a level of tension and interest has not been caused for a long time by TV series and, in principle, everything that has been in pop culture for a long time. Applause for the creators!\n",
      "Took a few episodes for me to be hooked in, but when I finally was, it took off. From loving a character to absolutely hating them, this show made you feel. This being my first Korean show watch, I will never regret it. Episode 6, tears galore.\n",
      "Increíble para dormir.\n",
      "Fotografía genial. Diálogos pobres. Guion mediocre. Típica serie de moda que sube como la espuma y olvidas al mes siguiente.\n",
      "Very predictable. It's like Brazilian \"3%\" and Spain \"Mind Heist\" in one project. Super overrated\n",
      "Lo que sí se es lo chocante que es, además, el formato mola un montón, es novedoso, y a la gente le causa curiosidad, cosa que entiendo.\n",
      "También tiene sus partes malas, con algo de relleno, a mí lo que me mola son los juegos y un poco la trama del policía (aunque cada vez menos), pero la parte de drama no me interesa tanto, siempre espero que avance por lo dicho, los juegos y no por el drama.\n",
      "El prota me cae fatal, héroe básico despreocupado que siempre ha sabido apañarse para ganarse la vida y que en los momentos importantes tiene suerte, me recuerda un poco a Naruto al principio.\n",
      "Y por último, es algo evidente a veces, no juega demasiado con el suspense, y yo creo que da para jugar con el suspense, pero prácticamente en todo momento sabes lo que va a pasar.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Lo bueno: El formato, esa combinación de elementos mola un montón, la parte de los juegos también, el diseño de producción, sencillo pero funcional, y algunos personajes te vas a quedar con ellos.\n",
      "· Lo malo: La historia quizás peca de ser demasiado sencilla, puede ser, además, hay veces que el ritmo decae demasiado.\n",
      "· Conclusión: Se va a convertir, si no lo ha hecho aún, en un clásico de Netflix y de la TV en general, así que hay que verla sí o sí, quizás en el momento en el que la rompió tendría más gracia verla, comentarla con la gente, pero ahora la pregunta en sí, ¿es o fue para tanto? Entiendo perfectamente que lo fuera, pero viéndola ahora, con la cabeza más fría, está muy bien, pero no, no es para taaanto, aún así, se merece los elogios.\n"

Sometimes it gets boring, especially in the last episode, but overall it's an intriguing bloody movie with a motivating humanistic ending.\n",
      "Squid Game is one of the most exciting TV Series Netflix has to offer. Even though a small number of the audience *might* disagree but the show is as good (not great) as anyone could expect it to be. The story has a lot of potentials to continue for a Second Season, but we'll have to wait and watch how it turns out. Full review at: https://www.theshchronicles.com/post/squid-game\n",
      "Very addictive to watch. I binge watched it. Only the dubbed version can be a bit weird when it comes to voice lines.\n",
      "squid game and breaking bad are so far 2 of the only shows that are worth the hype. each episode of squid game was exhilarating and made me forget how much time there was left in the episode and almost jump scared me when the episode ended cause of how into the show i was, its been forever since i've actually liked a new show. if you're putting off watching it cause of all the crappy tik toks and other videos of it just like i was just don't just watch it, its kinda sad that people meme breaking bad and squid game personally i think the people that meme them have never watched either of the shows before cause how could you watch them and have the audacity to try and make them funny?\n",
      "I've seen it before before it was all so caught up. I liked the film. I liked the underlying content even more. I'm looking forward to the second season, but I don't like that since it's been picked up everyone is talking about it. Of course it's not the film's fault.\n",
      "One of the best series i have every watched! It gives you suspense, drama and exciting moments. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. The characters are well established, the performances are exceptional. Please do watch it!\n",
      "one of the most enjoyable and engaging TV shows i've ever watched in my entire lifetime.some people may point out that the plot is not fully original which is true but it still works awesomely in my opinion.the games (which is the main part of the show) always accomplish its task, managing to be both fun to watch and thrilling at the same time.\n",

      "Simply a production of the highest level that inserts Korea as a power in the cultural industry. Excellent photography, outstanding characters, well-chosen cast, fantastic story, with a critique of liberal democracy. In my view, the main key to understanding the production and which I don't usually read in the reviews is that the viewer at the end wants the game to continue in a continuation of the series, that is, you and I are perverse just like the financiers and gamblers who entertain themselves by watching these deadly games.\n",
      "I liked watching this series. I like series about blood and secrets. And of course, a happy and not a happy ending.\n",
      "What will you do for money? is the main idea of Squid Game. Netflix's global hit is well-deserving, but is not 'perfect', hopefully we can get more answers in S2.\n"
