The excitement that NEVER STOPS!!
For someone who have never read the webtoon, I just gonna say: this drama is more than just amazing! It took me less than 3 days to finish the whole series simply because I just couldn't stop watching!!!!

From casting, to plots, to action scenes, and production, this drama is a perfection! There isn't any dull moment throughout the series and it's like a thrilling ride! So if you haven't watch it, you should go ahead and enjoy the ride, it will end before you even noticed! As there are a lot of shows with a pretty good start and went down the trail in the second half, but for this one, nope! It gets higher and higher that gives you a lot of anticipation till the end!

You could say it is a comedy, a thriller, a mystery, a fantasy, or an action drama, because it has all the genres in it!

If you are skeptical and worried of horror scenes, I can assure you it's not that scary, I don't fancy horror dramas too but this is perfectly fine for me! But do expect some tense up whenever you see the evil ghosts in action, but trust me, that excitement is just the thing that keeps you going! XD

I really adore the counter squad SO MUCH! Although they weren't related to each other and share different personality, when they come together, they became a bunch of sweethearts that make you smile :) Plus, their acting are really ON POINT that gets you into it! Action scenes or crying scenes, you name it! Never underestimate those young actor and actress; Byung Gyu and Se Jeong totally slayed it!

I would say they had a pretty good production too, literally nothing to pick on! Besides the action scenes, I really love how the male lead was summoning out the Territory, those colour effects!!! Gosh so heroic and I love it!!!!

Well since I couldn't name anything that I don't like about the show, it gives an absolute 10/10! Or maybe one bad thing of this drama is that ""It ends""!!! I heard they are having a Season 2 and I can't wait for it! Definitely one of the best dramas I have seen in the past year!!! Highly recommend :)

People who fight ghosts or demons and get them into the afterlife are nothing new in kdramas and although I liked a lot about how this world was set up or presented, it was not necessarily super original or unique, and does not work that deep sometimes. Yet, the people working it the afterlife did feel like their own character so their connection to our world felt a lot stronger than in some of these dramas, and I did enjoy the superpower aspect of this all a whole lot.

There was a bit of a superhero-feeling to this all, which I always found really fun to watch. It was the right amount of cool and camp in my opinion and I like how the show never felt like it was trying to be super serious, while also never feeling tacky or just odd. And I always admire it when a show manages that, because I feel like that is the right type of tone for a story like this. It gripped me completely from the first minutes. The plot is nicely paces, there is nice suspense within in the story, although it drags a bit towards the end, but there are countless questions and cliffhanger moments that come up in each episode that always made me excited for the next one.

I did feel like the show did drag a bit or loose some steam when it focused to heavily on the crime and human corruption of the show, rather than the supernatural problems of the characters. For a drama about people capturing evil spirits I wanted them to capture more evil spirit and for that too have a more central role within the story than it did.

Although the drama did a good job with mixing the characters conflicts, their backstories of the characters, with the main story, I also felt like I had seen that type of story play out a bit too often and there could have been more balance between the crime plot and the quest for fighting evil spirits.

There was a lot more crime in there than I would have wished for, but I can not say that I was bored while watching it. The story has it’s momentum, I could never really guess where is was going. It has a good pace, and there was always a bit of humor and a lot of cool action to go along with it with some really loveable characters that you just can’t help but love. This drama has a lot of good things (action, humor and heart) and does those things really well.

Our main character are true underdogs, and you really do feel for them. They made me tear up several times. Especially So Mun and personal quest and his connection to his new superpowers. He really does grow with it. It may all be a bit typical for a story like this one, but it works really well.

All the main characters are deep, with their own flaws and strengths. They frustrate you, yet you love them and feel so much with them. And I found the evil spirit, their main rival apart from the evil politicians and corrupt police officers, really well crafted. I just really like that aspect of the show. That was why I tuned into it and why I continued on watching it.

The love and affection between all the characters is just wonderful. It’s overflowing with heart; whether it’s the love that So Mun has for his grandparents and vice versa, his friends from school and then the little family that the Counters have. This little found family really touched my whole heart, it’s one of my favorite tropes and I love it when it’s done right, and made me shed tears many times throughout the drama. There’s just a really good heart in this story.

The Uncanny Counter is just a lot of fun. I feel like it sort of threads this path of being familiar and yet unique enough that it feels fresh and exciting. There is suspense and humor and heart at the core of each and every episode, and the cast is super loveable and tug at your heartstrings a lot and which is the true strength of the drama. That found family aspect and the friendship and love between the main characters. It talks a lot about human greed and corruptions and how that feeds the evil spirits and vice versa, which does sometimes feel a bit heavy handed, but the plot is well paced and exciting, so I never got bored, and there is a really good underdog story there that makes it all worthwhile.

An “ Uncanny” Tale of Family , Friendship and The Supernatural...

Looking back retrospectively , Uncanny Counter has an undeniable amount of character progression since episode 1 for our main high-schooler hero Mun( Jo Byung Koo) as well as his fellow counters Mo Tak ( Yoo Joon Sang), Ha Na ( Kim Se Jeong) and of course Chu Mae Ok ( Yeom Hye Ran), yet, it’s crucial not to sugarcoat the fact that at times , the storyline felt a little inconsistent and slow- paced ( especially by the second-half )as well.

Of course it’s wrong to say that the scriptwriting was dire, as the story and characters were fairly well-written. Thanks to the collaboration of screenwriters Jung Do Yoon ( Witch’s Court, The Time We Were Not In Love), Yeo Ji Na ( Il Mare) and Kim Sae Bom ( Hello Schoolgirl), the wonderful talents of the cast and director Yoo Seon Dong ( respectively who has also worked as a screenwriter on productions such as Shoot My Heart),the show was interwoven with enough action and fights in episodes without falling down the trap of becoming a mindless and dull action show.

Uncanny Counter had an evident story plot with the Counters chasing after the “ big bad” antagonist of the series from episode 1, as well as learning more about themselves through becoming a surrogate family for one another in the process. This was an undeniably sweet progression for our characters , however , there was a little bit of repetitiveness before the half-way mark with the typical episode progression of the counters chasing after a / the “ big bad” spirit , a conflict or event gone wrong and one of the main characters beginning to doubt their abilities or recollection of events ( particularly for Mun).

As a consequence the show sometimes felt a little lagging in the second-half, consequently meaning that there were some undeniably inconsistent moments for our heroes as well as deeper questions about the other-side. Just some of these include; Mun’s presumable absences at school ( during certain missions) not being raised or alerted , Mo Tak’s slightly lacklustre reactions towards certain events in the storyline, the fate of Ha Na’s family ( and considering the final ending, if she could’ve have been granted the same wish) , the relationship between Mae Ok and her husband as well as questions about the other side( not least what happens to the guides when their Counter fades, who controls the guardians and what happens to the spirits of the Counters). Whilst some of these point are mainly minor , they do point out some slightly loose ties within the overall story arch.

Overall although not a flawless production ,Uncanny Counter was a good drama and its success has certainly been sealed by the unusual decision ( especially for OCN) to bring out a second season

The Uncanny Heroes
The Uncanny Counter tells the story of a crew of demon hunters who protect regular folks from malevolent spirits. These selfless and intrepid individuals, called Counters, have been bestowed with supernatural powers by the high council of the spiritual realm of Yung and are each partnered with a spiritual being who mentors and guides their every action in investigating and combating paranormal threats on Earth.

Helmed by director-screenwriter Yoo Seon Dong, who is no stranger to the supernatural/ horror genre with previous works such as Vampire Prosecutor 2, Arahan, and Musudan. He currently directs the popular action-comedy Bad and Crazy. Adapted from the first season of the webtoon Amazing Rumour (경이로운 소문) by Jang Yi (장이) based on the screenplay by Yeo Ji Na (ep. 1-12), Kim Sae Bom (ep.14-16) and director Yoo Seon Dong himself for one episode (ep. 13). There was much speculation regarding the change in screenwriters during the drama’s run, the result of which may have impacted the fluctuations in the viewership ratings and audience feedback particularly towards episode 13. Nonetheless the director and original screenwriter Yeo Ji Na are slated to return for the sequel season, scheduled to be released in 2022. Kim Woo-geun served as music director and had composed the opening theme for the title sequence.

The Uncanny Counter has the distinction of being the highest rated OCN production in terms of viewership ratings, in the history of the TV channel (at the time of writing). In addition, actress Yeom Hye Ran won best supporting actress at the 57th Baeksang for her supporting role here. Originally planned for 12 episodes, 4 additional episodes were added due to the explosion in popularity of the drama, which also resulted in the drama being re-broadcasted by sister channel TVN as well as selected for distribution by Netflix upon the conclusion of its initial television broadcast. The sequel, The Uncanny Counter 2, will be based on the serialized second season of the webtoon which was recently published in June 2021. Principal photography took place mainly in Gyeonggi-do, with Neowiz Pangyo Tower and Haenggung Mansion cafe used as the filming locations for Taeshin Group HQ and Eonni’s Noodles restaurant respectively. The communications earpiece used by the Counters are Samsung Galaxy Buds series wireless earphones in mystic white.

What I Absolutely Loved

The premise of the drama, the overarching story, the interweaving plotlines, the respective character arcs and the fusion of diverse elements. Being an action packed supernatural mystery with themes of slice-of-life, melodrama, politics, chaebols, police investigation and corruption, this is one of the most enjoyable dramas that I’ve watched in recent memory. Although I have not read the webtoon, the basis of the setting is not overly complicated to comprehend. The concept of demons/ evil spirits, the heavenly/ spiritual realm and emergence of superpowered beings are presented in a coherent and straightforward manner within the context of multiple POV characters as well as complex plotlines that converge in due course.

The pace of the storytelling is brisk and engaging while the action and dialogue segments are balanced in proportion. I was never bored or confused throughout the entire series. Despite the original idea of fighting demons isn’t uniquely groundbreaking, how this drama distinguishes itself from others of the same genre is quite innovative. Think Ghostbusters and Taxi Driver with a tad of Bad Guys and Sell Your Haunted House, and perhaps even a wee bit of Karate Kid.

In terms of the production quality, I truly have to commend the action choreography and application of “wire-fu”. This may not be a wuxia but there’s a healthy amount of physics-defying stunts - breathtaking at times and a whole lot of fun most of the time. I noticed a combination of MMA moves and parkour stunts infused in the sequences as well, which adds to the variety for good measure. However, a forewarning for the squeamish - this drama contains a fair amount of blood and gore. The horror aspect isn’t nearly as terrifying or brutal as the depiction of violence, which can be disturbing for viewers who do not appreciate the sight of blood and brutality. The special effects are well rendered, particularly for the pyrotechnics involved, as well as the visual effects and CGI for certain “magical scenes” and the colourful “territorial shifts” that form part of the Counters’ unique abilities.

The well written main characters and the fantastic cast who brought them to life. When the source material is so intricately developed, it simply makes the worldbuilding that much easier to envision and execute. The characterisation is very nicely conceived which adds depth to the storytelling, dimensions to the plot and endear them to viewers in ways that enrich the whole production.

My second time seeing Cho Byeong Kyu immediately after Hot Stove League, I must first comment on his youthfulness. Portraying a highschool teenager here at the age of 25, he completely pulls it off, with or without the perm. Then there’s the acting. He showcases a lot more of his range in his role as the ML So Mun where he is undoubtedly the MVP of the show. Yeom Hye Ran is worthy of her Baeksang award because of her touching performance as the motherly Chu Mae Ok. Yoo Joon Sang and Kim Se Jeong round off the members of the Counters as Ga Mo Tak and Do Ha Na respectively. Each of them provides a compelling depiction of the gamut of emotions in their character development from the traumatic backstories to the present day where the entire team exudes so much camaraderie on display that they are simply a joy to behold.

Of the supporting cast, Ahn Suk Hwan is superb as the supportive and comedic Choi Jang Mool, the financier. Lee Hong Nae’s stoic portrayal of Ji Chung Shin is very intriguing and fits well with the persona of the antagonist of the narrative. Choi Kwang Il is just as riveting to watch here as he was in Hometown, this time playing the mayor Shin Myeong Hwi. His versatility is truly remarkable and he is convincing whether as a politician or as the head of a chaebol. Moon Sook plays the elderly Wi Gen, the ML’s spiritual partner who radiates the warm and loving goodness of a halmeoni. I feel that she and ML share the most interesting partnership among the Counters and their respective partners. Not forgetting as well Kim Eun Soo and Lee Ji Won as Kim Woong Min and Im Joo Yeon, the ML’s childhood BFFs, who provided some of the more touching moments in the show.

What I Didn’t Appreciate As Much

Highschool bullying is abundantly featured in this drama. It’s not a theme that I particularly enjoy watching and it does feel excessive especially during the first half of the story. This is not the garden variety bullying but falls into the highly brutal and savage category. That said, I do understand the necessity of enduring such hardships as part of the ML’s character building. However the graphic nature of the depiction eventually becomes a little too disturbing to stomach.

As far as the side characters are concerned, I would have loved to see more development for Choi Yoon Young’s Kim Jung Young. She’s clearly a decent actress but her role here is somewhat subdued and rather one-dimensional. Lee Chan Hyung’s Kwon Soo Ho is quite fascinating but lacks significant screen time that the character perhaps merits.

Regarding the change in screenwriters with the director taking over the writing for episode 13 that resulted in the backlash by the majority of viewers, I can see their point. Certain events that transpire in that episode do not seem to make a lot of sense, which unfortunately represent a blip in what has been exemplary writing for the most part. Aside from one frustrating major scene, a couple of plot points simply do not quite provide the required satisfaction to their conclusions. Fortunately the remaining 3 episodes reverts to normal service and delivers a stirring finale that this production deserves.

Final Thoughts

The Uncanny Counter comes highly recommended by many and I absolutely concur. It is deserving of the plaudits for being one of the highlights of 2021’s offering of K-dramas. There is much to enjoy and even love about this OCN production. And the good news? Season 2 is coming so hopefully we will get more of the same quality in technical execution and storytelling.

If you're thinking about starting on this drama now that it's done, let me just share with you on what I thought about it.

First of all, reading the plot summary got me real interested in the drama. I mean it involves demon hunting so if you like action, this one is for you. If you want romance, then give this one a skip. There's no romance at all. Instead, there's more of a growing family & friends relationship.

Story: It's a slow beginning but picks up pretty quickly afterwards, especially when the counter's backstories come into play. I think only two counters backstories played a main role to the plot. The other two is more for a viewer to understand how they became a counter, which is unfortunate as the spotlight for these two seemed limited. For the first half of the drama, the plot moved at a good pace, numerous demon hunting scenes which is great because this is what the drama is about, and mysteries and unanswered questions were revealed.

But after the halfway mark is where a drama either make it or break it. I say more of break it because right around ep 9 or 10, plot holes began to occur.
* What a surprised (sarcastically)............... this involves political corruption. Figures.... since everything happened because of this. This is nothing new when it comes to figuring out the villain.
* A lot of questions came to play that seemed like the writers didn't focus on, which would've made scenes more understandable. I'm not sure what happen with the writer here because I found a lot of episodes a drag or stalling after ep 8. A lot of those episodes (especially ep 10) should've been handled differently, as you really could've just skipped some episodes and you wouldn't even know you missed out on something. I knew they changed the writer at Ep 13, which at least showed plot progressing a little bit, but even then, there were too many random things thrown in and only one or two sentences (if any) to describe what happened for the final half. You could also blame the announcement of season 2 for this mess that occurred after ep 8.
* We went from the counters hunting for demonic spirits in order to protect humans to just focusing on 1 for the rest of the drama. If this 1 demonic spirit was the head leader and the other evil spirits they hunted were under him, then this would've been okay but since this wasn't the case, this seems like the writer or director lost direction in the second half, like he was the only demonic spirit left, no one else in their area was demon possessed.
* Useless spirit partners. I mean I guess they lend them their powers (and wands) but all they do is sit at the table and discuss things. They only worry about their world partner if something happens to them physically. I just didn't see an importance to them, besides getting the counters (except for So Mun) out of a coma.
* The most evilest villain in this drama never had a demonic spirit in him until the last few episodes, even though he has committed murder and has thoughts of murder. According to the spirit partner's statement, anybody who has committed murder or desire to murder attracts a demonic spirit. So why wasn't he possessed a long time ago? That doesn't make sense.

But even after all of that, I still enjoyed this drama. I love the action, the closeness of a family the counters had for each other, the dramatic scenes of the demonic spirits being cast out, and the comedy this drama showed (more in the first half of the drama, fewer in the second half). Though they may have thrown some random stuff in and missed out some important details for us viewers to understand, at least I can say that the ending is satisfying and that there's closure.

If you step outside, I'm pretty sure you can hear me screaming.

I told myself I was going to do 2021 differently and stop giving 10 stars so easily but OH MY GOSH!! How can this not be rated 10 stars!?
Everything and I do mean everything about this show was amazing.... okay maybe not *everything* --but I'll come back to that later.

The Uncanny Counter is probably the first show I have watched that kept me stalking the next episode release date. Lol but not only that, every episode was so packed with action that there were no boring parts. There was never a time I wanted to stop watching and it kept me glued to the screen because I knew if I looked away I would miss something important. Lol That says a lot to though because I'm not really big on action but the uniqueness of this show kept me hooked.

All of the actors did so amazing! Even small scene actors took it to a whole new level and made you remember them. I've never been a fan of shows/movies that have a lot of characters, especially random ones that somehow were ""important"" -- they always left me like ""okay but if you are so important why are you coming in now and I don't even remember your name"" kinda thing. Lol BUT.... The Uncanny Counter just had some kind of magic in it that left me feeling completely different.
Like episode 15 for example when they brought in that new character. That really threw me off because I was like ""um... why are you here? There is literally one episode left. WHY ARE YOU HERE?! WHO ARE YOU!?"" lol but in the end, even though I still don't fully understand WHY, I can't even be mad. Lol It's so weird.

While the sudden show up in episode 15 was ..... something. Lol another problem I had with the show was Hana's back story? She is a full ass whole mystery herself. Which is cool and all but we know everyone else's history and all through the show we get glimpses of hers and the demons ALWAYS bring up her past-- so we know it HAS to be important to the story to help understand her character. But... did we ever even get the full backstory or answers? I feel like I blinked and missed something? Did they explain it but I'm too dumb to understand? Don't get me wrong, I like her character. I just am confused? If they didn't tell us, will they tell us in season 2?

Speaking of season 2, why? I mean I'm glad we will get to see them again but this season ended perfectly. and I mean PER-FECT-LY!! I can't stress that enough. I feel like if we get a season 2, there is no way it will be as good as the first and I feel like it's bound to make us lose a few of our favorite characters. WHICH I CAN'T GET DOWN WITH! lol
I am *concerned*. Haha

well worth the watch!!
I fell in love with this drama from the very start! From the acting to the plot, it just captured my interest and hit all my sweet spots for a drama ie. action, comedy, drama, mystery, fantasy, suspense. I loved it all!

I think the most beautiful thing about this drama was the friendships/relationships between characters. The Counters truly became a tight-knit family and their bond feels so real. Their pain became each other's pain and there was no unnecessary contrived conflict between them. They loved each other and had each other's back. All the conflict was external and I quite liked it that way.

Honourable mention: So Mun and his 2 best friends were the most wholesome adorable friendship I've ever seen in a drama. Their undying love and loyalty for So Mun was unparalleled and you could feel his love for them too.

As for the plot, I saw a few complaints that the story diverged from fantasy-action to more about political corruption, but I think everyone saying that is missing the biggest message of the entire drama. In a world of evil spirits and supernatural horror, the most evil monsters are the corrupt and greedy humans around us. I felt like the whole drama pulled in all these aspects really well and tied it together perfectly.

Also, Jo Byung-gyu's acting as So Mun was outstanding. I loved everyone in this drama but his acting was so phenomenal. I felt everything he felt, ached and hurt when he felt broken down. He truly did such a wonderful job in this role and I wish him so much success for the future in many more lead roles.

Anyway, I sincerely hope there is a Season 2. With the way the drama wrapped things up in the finale, I really believe they did so in preparation for a season 2.

Oh, the power of teamwork :’)

Man, this drama was by far one of the best things to happen in 2020-2021, started off great, had a plot that for the most part stayed consistent throughout all 16 episodes, it had protagonists you were rooting for the entire way, and even some antagonists ... Due to some background reveal, I cannot stress enough how much I loved this series because it had one core message:

“You can’t do it alone.”

Which is entirely true, you had a protagonist like So Moon, who you cared for throughout the entire series due to him trying to find his parents (which thank god, HE DOES, woot woot!), not to mention he was bullied along with the rest of his friends, and by the end of the story even though his leg was healed, he stayed humble, cared for his grandparents and had probably one of the best developments of the whole series, he went from a small to TALL lol, in the best possible way, but he couldn’t have done any of that without being a counter, and trusting and relying on the other counters, who each had their own backgrounds and I loved that ... Especially Mae Ok and her son, sweet lord, I cried internally many times ... Throughout the whole show they helped each other and that’s what made this a great watch, they were all like family from beginning to end. Not to mention the end is probably one of the best kdrama finales of 2020, it wasn’t anticlimactic like most I’d seen that year, it had just the amount of firepower to call the end satisfying, not to mention most characters got their closure, including the counters, Moons friends & Moon’s parents, and most importantly the villains got their justice. YES.

There were only a few things about the series that could’ve been better imo:

1. Hyuk Woo (aka Mayors son) joined Moon’s friend group, he had one of the best developments alongside Moon, by end of the series. The guy was an asshole from the start, but NOT to finish, as a matter of fact he was a victim through the whole series, but of course nobody finds that out until halfway through, which I also loved. His dad was abusive and didn’t care about him, but in the end he learns to live with the things his father has done, sends off some apologies to Moon’s friends and anyone else he’s hurt and goes his own way, what sucks about this, is now he’s going to be known as the son of a murderer, yes the mayor ... So his life probably won’t get any better, not to mention he doesn’t have any friends, I hope by s2 we see him join the group, because he grew on me as character and he wasn’t disrespectful to Moon’s grandparents when you know ... He got possessed and tried to kill the counters, and woke up at Moon’s place lol, I think he just wants a normal life with friends and people who care about him, and that’s why in s2 if possible I hope he gets that :’)

2. The fight scenes were great but could’ve been better tbh, there were a lot of punches and throws but I also felt for a good chunk of the series the counters were overpowered, which to some extent is fine, but not all the time ... I don’t want to see some ass whooping in characters other than the villains lol, especially ever other episode

3. Episodes had a “meh” dip at the last 6 episodes, bedsides the finale where, some things happened, but some of it was filler, or felt like it to me.

Those are the only things I wish could’ve been done better in this drama, but hell guys, if that’s all I’m picking out here, and tbh those are small things, this drama was written RIGHT, the plot, cinematography, OST, and acting chops were all glorious in this, and I’d recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a story with “family,” as the primary plot focus, it was incredibly well done, and I give a shout out to all the cast & crew who worked on this drama.

A lot of qualities and many flaws too but it is enjoyable overall
WHAT I LIKED:
- The many characters with different personalities and tempers. They are able to form a good team supporting each other. The relationship between them is well told.
- The background story of the counters. Each of them has a well made backstory which give them depth and makes them endearing.
- The pace: the drama is fast paced with a lot of good action. I enjoyed the fights.
- The mix between thriller and supernatural is pretty well made even if I wished the realtionship between the bad humans and the evil spirits was stronger and lasted longer
- The supporting characters are interesting: the sponsor, the female cop and her trainee, the two friends of Mun...
- Most of the actors are very good.

WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:
- Too much unnecessary violence
- Sometimes repetitive: Abducting someone and making a call to threaten to kill him. This is done several times
- Some flaws in the story: How come visiting your own memories can lead you to enter the memories of another person and fight in his memories and so find where he is hidden. It is a stretch.
- Some events and elements do not serve the story and are just here to create emotions: the ankle broken and repaired several times, the bullying and beating by the schoolboys thugs, the kid with disease, the orphans, the old folks... plenty of usual tropes.
- The main lead allways accuses himself of being responsible for everything bad happening and cries too much. It became annoying in the end.
- The story is thin: they catch bad persons and evil spirits. It was so thin, from the middle of the drama, it started to be draggy like they don't have a good story to tell and they focus on creating repetitive and useless scenes focusing on the characters' emotions. The bad guys are catched way too easily between two emotional scenes. The final fight was also disappointing.

OST: It was ok for the genre.

REWATCH VALUE: I won't rewatch it.

OVERALL: This drama is a huge success. Personally I found it was emotionally a roller coaster ( a bit too much sometimes) but storywise it was not so interesting. It is entertaining mostly because of the sympathy you have for the main characters, their story and their suffering and their success but I was clearly not amazed by the complexity of story. I still recommend it as a good and easy watch.

Engaging and well-written beginning with a repetitive and draggy second half
Being the highest rated OCN drama in history, you'd have high standards when going to watch this drama.

The first half of the series very much lived up to those standards. The second half however, not so much.

- STORY -
The story begun very consistent and engaged audiences through the concept of 'counters' that attack evil spirits and well, disguise themselves as noodle shop owners. The main antagonist was introduced very early into the story, and it paced itself well from there on as the viewers not only watched the counters try to defeat the Level 3 spirit, but also as our main protagonist (So Min) tried to settle as a counter and deal with his anger issues and ongoing grief for his parents.

One of the faults that comes with introducing a main antagonist early on is that the story itself, drags on for 16 episodes, and by episode 10/11 the story became repetitive in a 'rinse and repeat' format as the counters continue to fail at killing the main antagonist, and the antagonist of course, only got stronger.

This 'failure' also lead to many plot holes and introductions to over-powerful material such as harry potter-looking sticks that feel unnecessary and almost, humorous for a plot-line that isn't meant to be funny. Additionally, So Mun is never seen going to school nor does the 'noodle shop' have anything to do with the main storyline, leading it to be unnecessary in the log-line and synopsis.

- CHARACTERS -
The strongest part of this drama is the well-written main cast and each of their own backstories. The greatest part of our protagonist So Mun is that he truly is written to live up to his name, an 'uncanny' counter. Being a kid, he's immature, angry and reacts inappropriately in situations that truly reflect his age. Motak and Hana are also written to act, think and react in ways that appropriately reflect their age and their traumatic pasts that led them to be counters. Jo Byungyu, Kim Sejeong and Yoo Jun-sang really proved themselves with their incredible acting performance.

The antagonist was also so well-written to point where he's almost likeable. Himself and the Presidents son became antagonists that I genuinely enjoyed, and wishing for more scenes involving solely them. Props to Lee Hong-nae.

Despite this, there were also flaws in the writing of some characters. For example, the 'Yung' team being unlikeable, useless and completely unforgiving in the way they treat the protagonists. Despite them having their own backstories, such as the son, I struggled to feel any sort of empathy for them, as they relied entirely on the counters to let them live their lives. Furthermore, The dragging of the President's story and his 'followers' ruined the like-ability and interest for the characters, emphasising the poorly written second half.

-----

Overall, I still believe that each person should give this drama a good-go. Especially for the captivating first half that balances intense fighting scenes, humour and sadness perfectly.

I am interested to see where the second season of this story leads, hoping it does not continue the rinse and repeat storyline that many people complained of.

OVERRATED, needed 6eps only
don't get me wrong, I love the main cast and I loved them as characters but as a plot it offered nothing new. it was just a mix of every other dramas;
the bullying happens in every school genre, the evil corrupt politician happens in every law/crime genre and the main evil spirit was like every other psychopath, like strong woman dobong soon.

the only things I enjoyed were the hugs, the unexpected familyness and the 1st big fight when the evil spirits collabed which created a good amount of angst.
afterwards it was just another repeated mess of cliches. they kept trying to kill of Mae Ok becasue she was the ""weakest"" link.
the bullying honestly felt like a fight club, there's no way anyone could not see what was going on. with that severity of bullying every kid would've been dead or crippled..

Wi Gen ""betraying"" them the 1st time made no sense. she didn't talk about it and she wasn't against them but it was just used for cheap struggle.
the bully just looked like a 30 year old hurting kids and well the actor is 30 so that was a big mismatch ;/ and the whole wrap up of that part is a horrible lesson to teach kids. ""take bullying, don't fight back, love and forgive the bully until they redeem themselves"" ;/


the pace was slow, the evil people got too much screen time and they didn't achieve their full potential, I don't know if the writer change happened in this season, but they need a better writer.
though nothing will make me watch s2 ;(

Super power heros meets kdrama
I'm not sure what all the high reviews are about. This drama was 14 episodes too long, basically the whole story was 2 episodes (and this point was VERY clear from the first two episodes), and it dragged forever. Of course we know like always good defeats evil and prevails. Then we have all the cheesy actions from ML being the strongest like any other Hollywood teenage series. There were no character development, perhaps it was more for the bad guys than the leads. Then we have the corruption scandal which is becoming a core part of almost every single kdrama. The plot holes and illogical course of action the leads take just left me baffled on how the writers and producers came up with such lame scenarios.
Overall, felt the writers just wanted to show some cool action scenes to satisfy teenagers, and then had to come up with a story to justify it and nothing beats corruption and some tearjerker family murder drama.

This show was not perfect, no show is. But it was so engaging, I was able to ignore and not think about any possible plot holes or “convenient” plot lines until I finished it. My overly critical and overanalyzing brain was so emotionally connected to the characters and plot, it couldn't care less about any mistakes.

If I had to describe the plot in just a few words I would say: Fight against the supernatural evil, and the one hidden in humanity, that leads to bettering oneself. The format is repetitive, it’s undeniable truth. They dealt with one evil spirit, a new stronger one showed up. How come it’s not boring? At first, the cases are simply a background for introducing the characters, creating a team work and So Moon’s dive into a whole new world. Slowly, the past connections between different characters are discovered, and the background plot starts to take a forefront position. The progression from the simple procedural plot to uncovering the past mystery and dealing with the main villain is perfectly gradual, and speaks of the great pacing The Uncanny Counter has.

The core of the show are the characters. The cast is pure perfection, and whoever was the casting director, they should get a rise. We are presented with more or less four teams: high school friends, Counters, Yung partners and the evil assholes. Each group is well written and portrayed, and even the villains are charming in their own twisted ways. I still wanted to see them dead, but I was also curious about their next actions and shenanigans. The loyalty among the young friends, the protectiveness of Counters, the moral dilemma the partner’s faced - all that made me love each and every character.

The acting is top notch. Jo Byung Kyoo is a true star of the show. His acting made me cry, scream, laugh, hit my head on my desk… He was So Moon. Kind, smol, positive, but also flawed character, that was willing to slowly learn, mature and improve himself. Easily in my top 5 favorite characters of all times. Each and every actor committed to their roles completely. I honestly did not feel that even one scene or expression was off. I was especially surprised by Kim Se Jeong's performance. I knew she was a good actress, but she improved so much with the few roles she had previously.

Production value was everything I could wish for. It is a mainstream kdrama, high quality of visual aspects is expected tho. The directing of the fighting sequences was well done, making them exciting to watch. Some of the stunts in the first episode felt slightly off, but they quickly improved and became way more natural.

I’m not gonna lie, I did not pay that much attention to the soundtrack as I was watching the show. I was completely “distracted” by the plot to notice what kind of music is being played in the background. That said, I usually don’t care that much about the osts, unless they are extremely bad, not fitting or painfully overused. After listening to the song as I was writing the review, I must say: they are good. Each has a completely different feeling and emotional quality, but they are all making me want to listen to them on repeat.

So what are the flaws? The biggest one was the slightly anticlimactic ending. With all the set up, I was expecting a bit more. Tiny, convenient plots that are either added or forgotten, like Moon, at some point, is never shown attending school. We just don’t see him going there at all. Never to be addressed nor mentioned. He is still a student, he wears his uniform… but he ain’t even close to being in class. Then we have the introduction of Oh Jeong Gu close to the end that felt out of place and useless.
Taking into consideration how well crafted the story and characters are, I was able to ignore the flaws. These cons barely tipped the scale, since the pros were that good.

Overall: damn yes. This show had such an emotional impact on me, there were moments when I had to pause the episode, since I was scared/not ready for whatever was going to happen. I loved each and every character. I was curious about the plot and how the team will deal with the obstacles they were facing. There was not one boring episode, and even tho I am fine with the given conclusion, I would not mind a possible second season.

*Trigger warning: severe bullying. It’s pretty bad guys, especially in the beginning episodes.

Not impressed with the finale Episodes...
I still remember the first episode that the action sequences were really impressive. Also the overall making looks very refreshing and it felt like a quality drama in the start and also they maintained that pace in the coming few Episodes as well, But towards the end it lacks many things quite bored last 4 or 5 Episodes and somehow managed to finish at last. For me its totally an average drama experience

Ocn achieved their all time best highest rating from this drama and also they announced for a season 2. But i don't think there will be a need for a 2nd season. Because its kind of boring towards its end. Also the way they ended was also really not that impactful or cliffhanger kind of setting. I heard there was a writer change in the 13 th epi.. i don't know what exactly the reason for that poor quality making in the finale Episodes. The only interesting factor that i find there was, some good emotional scenes. Its quite good to watch.

Anyway it will be a one time watch atleast for some people. Forcefully somehow managed to end, if you have a good start then you have to finish to off that well also.

fighting evil, overthrowing the goverment and other extreme sports
what is there not to like really?

with a set of amazing and well written characters and outstanding work from a wonderful cast this is a set up to add more people in your favourite drama characters list. The story takes you on an emotional roller coaster, getting to know the characters, learning their motives and behaviours and watching them work hard to reach their goals no matter how many obstacles get in their way. It also gives yet another insight on political injustice, corruption and how rich people deserve to be burned.

The action is great as well as the special effects and the plot is good. Comedic relief is definitely there and it's hilarious. There's also like minimum romance which for some would be a drawback but the friendship developed between the characters is just so pure and beautiful there's nothing to complain about. Lots of great character development that makes you feel like a proud parent too.

There were times where conversations would get long and boring but i skimmed through them so i can't really speak on that lol. Nevertheless, it's one of the only dramas that i managed to keep up to perfectly while still on going and not forget about it or lose interest half-way (which happens often to me, with completed dramas too, just check my watchlist lol).

I 100% recommend, it's family friendly too. maybe prepare tissues (?)

Best TV SHOWS
I just want to let you guys know this shows is very fascinating and worth it. The actors are very funny, their personality does matches their appearance which draw a lot of attention to the viewers. The musics in the background is very epic and it does goes well with the theme shows. The story of this shows really does suit my ideal genre types of shows which grab a lot of attention from me continuing to watched. That is all i can say, and I just want this show will gain more popularity, well right now it is very popular on netflix and other streaming sites.

demon hunting, kick ass superpowers, concept of life and death, forgiveness, fight against corruption, red tracksuits and a group of lovely individuals. all of these describe the drama ""the uncanny counter"" and i believe it's uncanny how wonderfully done the writer did with painting characters that are flawed perfection. i'm not saying this drama is perfect but the chemistry of the characters are.

to be frank, i found the beginning episodes to be nicely paced and while the bullying parts were quite triggering at times, seeing eonni gang kick some bums were pretty entertaining. moon's character development wasn't underwhelming and it was great to see him not stoop low but stayed humble with a considerable amount of confidence. he is not petty and is willing to see the good in others despite how bad he was treated. although hyuk woo wasn't easy to forgive, i found his redemption arc heartbreaking. he doesn't have anyone in his life and witnessing true familial nature that is moon's grandparents probably made him reflect on things a lot.

this is probably one of those dramas where i have no problem with the cast AT ALL. everyone delivered their roles amazingly and i can not imagine anyone else playing their characters. moon, ms. chu, rich guy, mo tak, ha na, the villain (he do be fine), the evil spirits and heck even the other supporting characters did well.

the ost is godsent. absolutely beautiful and fitting to the scenes. from intro to outro, i definitely want a full playlist of all the songs from this drama.

okay. with positives comes the negatives. i actually felt like the last few episodes were draggy. while the actors of the politicians did good, i found myself skipping some of their scenes because it didn't interest me. i understand they have a big fish to catch but it felt a tad bit repetitive. when they did catch the guy and managed to summon the evil spirit, i don't know what i was expecting it felt anticlimactic. for the finale, i did enjoy seeing my faves enjoying themselves and such but the flashbacks of their fight scene and them with their grim reaper suits was cheesy and cliché. regarding moon's academic activities, did this boi forget he goes to school? i get it's behind the scenes but it's kinda weird we saw less of him in class/ at school as the episodes went on.

nevertheless, i still loved this drama as a whole as it features strong characters that emotional back stories but still managed to have comedy and action aspect. overall, this is a great watch and i'm not sure what's in store for season 2 but i'm looking forward!

Strong start and a decent finish!
At its basic essence, this show resembles a lot of MCU movies. You've got a hero origin story, a mystery surrounding hero and cast, and a enjoyable cast of characters who play off each other. But it is still a kdrama and like other kdramas, it can't really stick the landing.

The first half of the series is great and builds upon itself really well. It introduces the world extremely well and gives us some really good moments. The villain of the week format is universal and serves as a good introduction into this world. But after the half-way point, the story pivots to focus on the final villain. From there, each episode varies and has issues. Some episodes feel like they are speeding through story and moments, other times it feels like the show is creating scenarios to just extend the story a bit more. There are plot holes and the rules of the universe change randomly without good reason. It becomes a bit unfocused and because of that, I don't think it deserves a 9/10.

Even knowing the writer switch, the problems existed with the old writer as well. If there were really discussions about shortening the length of the drama, the writer didn't do anything great in the later episodes that totally showed that the drama should have ended a few episodes earlier. I know there will be a second season but I am worried about what happens in the future. Some characters were sidelined and poorly used in the last couple episodes. On top of that, there were questions posed and dropped. The comedy-drama balance was a bit off as well. I do hope that the new writer could start over in a way and find a new way to tell the story that still can maintain the same quality as before.

Yung and Restless
Story: Yung/Afterlife politics and real world politics don't gel thus giving this drama a feel that it's 2 unrelated dramas awkwardly stitched together. You can feel the 2 fighting for supremacy instead of complementing each other. Unfortunately, dire real world got the upper hand.

Acting: The Counter set does commendable job and their chemistry is palatable. Jo Byung-gye is the cutest actor ever and such a star presence so watch out for him. But the unsung MVP is Lee Hong-nae as the tortured baddy with a fabulous six-pack. His unusual face framed with a hoodie is the most iconic thing about this show. It's OTT politicians and sedated Yungsters that dock the acting points, however.

Music: Main theme is catchy from the first hearing and goes really well with Counters superhero posturing.

Rewatch value: Low given the drop in quality but Shirtless Shin (episode 16) deserves a freeze frame.

Overall: This drama wanted to be several things that didn't have any real connection. Evil spirits just randomly moved into high powered people without an attempt to harness the power for world domination or something. Which rendered the boring political plot pointless and swapping Shin for Evil Mayor as the big bad hurt the last batch of episodes. Still, finale delivered some genuine emotional beats thanks to Counter cast likability that never faltered even when the writing did. I will not return for Season 2, however, since Season 1 finale does a good job with wrapping everything up.

Check it out
I am a huge SyFy fan. I thought this show was so good! The acting and the story and the humor really made this show special. I fell in love with the main characters! I usually only review BL or LBGTQ shows, but I so enjoyed this! Though the show deals with some really heavy topics such as death, bullying, acceptance, grief (so much grief) and anger. The show really takes the viewer through all the stages of grief. I love how the Counters work together as a group. I kept putting off watching this because of my usual tastes in shows.
Check it out!!!!!!!!!!

Lovely family dynamics
Another great korean drama to just watch and enjoy. I watched it with my whole family and we all loved it.

I think Byung Kyu was the best choice to portray SoMun, he fits his character so well. The innocence that spark through his eyes, his willness to do anything to just protect the people he loves the most, his energy to just learn new things and learn from his experiences. I loved his character the most and it made me empathize with him a lot.

One of the best things of this drama are the family dynimics between the counters. I love when dramas include this trop of ""new found family"" and I love it even more when they carry out well. A good drama needs to have good characters in order to develop the story, and I think this one did a great job.

But certainly the best of best about this drama was the antagonist. I think Chung Shin's character did a great job at portraying a good villan and also making us feel sorry for him. I'm not justifyng his actions but I loved learning about his rough childhood and how he grew up.

I'm just happy that The uncanny counter is getting a second season cause I think the drama deserves it.

I waited a full week for the next episode and then realized that it was over...
Let me start by saying, I was gonna write one when it ended. It just hadn't registered that it ended. I watched the last episode when it came out and then patiently waited until now, which is when I realized that it had already ended. I am either still losing brain cells or my brain decided that I was not worthy of it and it stopped working on me.

First off, the story. It was a good story filled with excitement, mystery, and anticipation. Though, a disclaimer is that I watched it with my sister and she had a hard time following and focusing because of the fantasy element. All she could think about was how awkward it must have been for the actors to pretend in certain situations. I couldn't help but laugh. Putting that aside though, it was a very heart-moving story. I didn't cry...but I was definitely sad. I think a lot of things world-building-wise could have been done better or clarified but it was overall pretty good.

As for the acting, the actors were actually the reason I went to check it out in the first place. The actors even went on Knowing Bros to advertise it so I had to give it a try. The acting was done really well!!! I forgot that these people played other roles and on-screen, they were their own characters. There was no moment where I thought they were really out of character nor was there any moment where there was any real bad acting either. I think a big part of why I liked it was because the actors did such an amazing job portraying the characters and emotions that went along with each event.

The music. I actually gave it a 7.5 because before looking it up again. I didn't even remember what kind of music it had...I guess I wasn't really engrossed enough or the music didn't resonate with me enough to stick in my mind. Whatever it was, I felt kinda sorry for no reason. I did give it a higher score than I would have because on the listen independently from the drama. I actually really enjoyed it and began to question why I didn't remember any tracks.

For rewatch value, I actually gave it a 7 because I didn't think of rewatching it after I finished. It is a great story but I felt like aside from certain scenes, I wouldn't enjoy the rewatch as much. Though I haven't rewatched it yet so this part might change for better or worse. I do think I gave it a higher score than I would have because there are a lot of ways you can look into the story and its messages as time goes by.

I think an 8 is actually appropriate because it is a good, well-written story with an amazing cast that helped bring it to life. Through this, you can rediscover the more veteran actors while rewriting your opinion of newer ones. The only thing I would say is this is a more heavy (?) story and that there will probably be a group of people out there that don't like it. I did get a bit bored or tired watching some parts while others kept my eyes peeled to the screen and screaming when the credits came.

Like all my other reviews, I say give it a try. If it isn't for you, that's cool. If you like it, that's cool too. Wherever you stand, at least you gave it the shot it deserved before you formed an opinion on it.

Power Rangers: In Korea
This was almost exactly like Start-Up for me but better in some ways. Let me explain. This drama started out strong with good dialogue and action-packed scenes much like how Start-Up started out with the greatest of all time pilot episode. Both were pretty good till the middle-end part of the series where the dialogue and plot fall to nothing. I also want to mention that I started both dramas very early on when it was airing (I think ep 4 for both), so I felt the drop in quality every week. I feel like the writers of The Uncanny Counter just focussed more on the action aspect rather than the dialogue part, which was sad as there was way more dialogue than action. The characters in the drama became static and the action scenes became more predictable than ever. Hopefully, the second season changes some of this because I don't think I can stomach another power rangers episode at this age.

I enjoyed the comedy and pace of the drama until the twist in the middle
Then the story started to drag abit and start trying to milk the tear ducts.
Action packed in some places, comedy in others, when they are not trying to make you sob sob. depict the evils of politics and bribery in others. And not to mention the every growing evil spirits

Satisfying ending. Like the hard emotionless character of Kim Se Jeong. Free spirited wildman Yoo Joon Sang. And the boyish innocent Jo Byung Kyoo. btw, did i mention they are a group of people who catches spirits?

enjoyed it!!
i fell in love with the whole squad!!! the plot is actually quite common and its interesting how they relate the grim reaper thingy to the past problems of the crimes. but it gets somewhat slow and quite boring at times. and i think there was a bit of dragging too somewhere, especially on the crime part. but i enjoyed the squad moments so sooo much!! love how there’s stories for each member and i could relate to each one of em. and its great too how they also added casts on the other world, makes it a lil bit more engaging. also, amazing plus super cool cinematography and osts and action!!!

Engaging to the end
I had such a good time watching this show. It is in no way perfect, and in terms of technical aspects of storytelling and production, it probably wouldn't be among my top shows. My technical rating of it would probably be more around 8 or 8.5, but my enjoyment of it is around 9 or 9.5, so there's that.

But. But...

It was seriously so much fun to watch. I really loved the basic storyline of the counters, and I loved the character development that happened for each of the main cast. So Mun's friends are actually the best, and I want a gang like that someday.

Also am I the only one who hoped that in the end So Mun and Hyeok U could become good friends? I really wanted a bigger Hyeok U redemption arc. I feel like a lot of his faults stemmed from his father and [ SP OI LER] would probably be resolved by the end, when his father is out of the equation and So Mun has helped him to realize how terrible he's been.

If you're looking for a fun show, something light-hearted with serious moments, fun characters, and a pretty good story, then watch this show. It's worth it.

Wholesome and Gruesome go hand in hand for this one
Though the times I watched this drama weren't easy and I had barely any motivation to smile or engage in anything, I found myself enjoying this Drama, even laughing and crying whilst following the characters throughout the story. The concept and idea of this story, although I have not read the webtoon I find the overall implementation of it very felicitous.

The subject and main story seems to be on the heavier side, with death and tragedy not far. Nevertheless the drama itself, the lighthearted jokes and scenes as well as the mood set make it an ""easy to enjoy"" Drama.

generally speaking the cast seems to be in line with eachother, their characters and the storyline, making this drama, though scifi/fantasy, very believable and relateable. I was specifically impresed with Jo Byeonggyu's outstanding acting and couldn't imagine anyone else fit for the role.

This is a fun show with heartfelt moments and a good mix of action and comedy
Looking for something heartwarming? Looking for some fast paced action?
I feel like this show has a little bit of everything mixed in with it. There are kickass moments where you're rooting for the good guys and get to see justice served, but also unexpected heartbreaking moments. And if you're in the mood for utterly ridiculous comedic scenes? Those are there too! Some of my favourite comedic scenes include the team raiding a press conference and the mayor getting waste water dumped on him and an epic money heist which hinges on the ability of a certain strong dude to fake leg cramps. The show actually reminded me of the Fiery Priest, which is full of some truly epic comedy gold. (The fart scene in the vault? A classic.) But back to the Uncanny Counter.

So Mun is a really good main character - and despite getting superpowers all of a sudden he's not some perfect protagonist. You can see So Mun growing throughout the show from being this impulsive, naive kid who runs into dangerous situations by himself like a dummy to learning to be patient and relying on his teammates. His teammates are also complex characters with their own backstories and their friendships and personalities are part of what make the show worth watching.

You also get to see other people mature through the show, including the mayor's son who starts out as this major bully and transforms after being shown true kindness for the first time in his life when he is at his lowest. I feel like there was this theme of redemption with him and So Mun was a driving force in that. I don't know if he'll show up in season two but I really want them to be friends.

One of my only gripes with the show was with the Yung people and their unreasonable rules, where the Counters weren't even allowed to protect people and were just supposed to rid the world of evil spirits. I'm glad that later on they got permission to deal with the bad guys but that was seriously wack - also the way they welcomed back So Mun so suddenly after kicking him out seemed so fake.

In the last few episodes a lot of stuff happens and I found the reveal about So Mun's powers kind of weird / sudden. But I thought the show ended well and despite this being a show where you sort of know the good guys will triumph in the end, the journey there is fast paced and unpredictable with some major plot twists along the way. I'm not about to go binge read the webtoon, but I would watch season 2 if it comes out.

I would give this a solid 7.5-8.

Amateur with a capital A
I used to watch the original Power Rangers with my younger brother. All the heroes were good and all the baddies were bad. The characters were stilted and simple, but somehow the show wasn't cringey enough for me to grab the remote and fight to change the channel. This is what The Uncanny Counter reminds me of.

Like the Power Rangers of yore, the protagonists are always together. Every fight is basically the same, and done to the same degree. Because our heroes are almost always together, they have little opportunity to show who they really are through their actions. In addition, the writers break a cardinal rule of ""telling"" us instead of ""showing"" us the story.

My favorite actor here is Yeom Hye Ran as the motherly noodle chef. Her experience shows, and she delivers in every role she plays. Yoo Joon Sang plays the ex-detective with heaps of care and concern. Kim Se Jeong plays the closed and tormented Ha Na well. She is the only character who is written with a tiny a pinch of mystery. Ahn Suk Hwan is fun as the cool rich dude. And finally, Cho Byeong Kyu plays So Moon as a sensitive and tearful teen. I liked that he expressed a lot of emotion throughout the show. It's great that a guy can cry. On top of this, a huge shout-out goes to So Moon's best friends played by Kim Eun Soo and Lee Ji Won. They radiate care for him and are rightfully described as his pseudo-parents. Choi Yoon Young also plays her role as the police officer standing up to corruption in a delicate balancing act. She deserved more screen time. I appreciate that our main actors worked so hard to deliver their lines with as much depth as they could muster through the generic and terribly written script. Even the baddies did well in this respect. On the other hand, the afterlife characters in Yong really struggled.

The entire production is clearly an amateur undertaking. The unrefined camera angles and awkward blocking affects every scene. The script and writing is bland. The direction is lacking and inexperienced, but then again, they didn't have much to work with besides great actors. When I think about the Power Rangers, at least I knew they had their own way of speaking and individual interests. Here, they have these heartfelt scenes without layered context. We only care (a bit) because the actors are so good. The flow and rhythm of the story is simply devoid of characterization. The plot just keeps hurtling at the protagonists. One minute they're eating noodles and the next minute they're fighting. It's as if the story is being done to them and they are just there to react constantly. There is no build-up in between scenes. There is no foreshadowing to help us anticipate what comes next. There is no exploration of our heroes' pasts in order to push the story forward. There were only fragmented flashbacks without purpose. The whole show is campy and unsatisfying.

And let's talk about the violence for a second. How many scenes can you film of people stomping on other people's heads and beating them up? And murdering people with lots of blood? After a while it has no meaning, even for a teenage audience. Stop already.

In the end, I am surprised that I actually finished season 1. I can't quite pinpoint why. It has a youthful spirit. And I like a middle aged lady who can take down evil spirits. I didn't expect the depth of Stranger Things, but I at least expected better production values. Maybe I like Power Rangers more than I care to admit.

I have already watched this twice!
It has been a while since I have enjoyed a ""k-dramedy"" as much as this one. It never stopped keeping me entertained. I have already watched it twice! It's one of those dramas that when you watch it a second/third time, you notice things you may have missed. All the characters were performed very well, from the main character, his best friends, to his Grandparents, the to Uncanny crew. My favorite episodes were 3/4, those are the ones I have re-watched repeatedly. The last episode was a tearjerker but in a good way. I cannot wait for part 2!

Amazing show!
I just finished watching this on netflix and loved it!
I can't wait for season 2 which is supposed to start around September 2021.
The cast did an amazing job.This is my fist time seeing Jo Byeong-kyu and Lee Hong-nae ,and I am pretty amazed by their performances and would love to see them again soon.
Also,shocked to see Ahn Suk-hwan in such cool way,as I have seen him mostly in historical dramas playing the bad guy.
Now,the show does have a lot of disturbing scenes (which I am used to),but might be too much for some people,especially how people with power treat their employees.I see this so often in kdramas that make me believe that it might be real,which is terrifying ,same with kids beings abused by their own parents/relatives.

Took me only 2 days to finish this
I have watched more than fifteen k-drama's till now. But this is the fastest I have finished watching any drama. Why? I don't even know. The story is so amazing that if you start watching it you just can't stop. The excitement & curiosity of knowing what happens in the next episode keeps you attached to this drama. Most of the the things about this drama was great. This drama is so fun to watch. All of the things more or less makes makes though this is an sci-fi, supernatural drama. The story is simple & fun to watch. What I meant by simple that the story is easy to understand.
If you are thinking about watching it then please do so. I can assure you that you won't regret it for sure. And rewatching this drama will be also very enjoyable!

THE EXCITEMENT REALLY NEVER ENDS!!
At first, I was skeptical of this drama, but the first episode grabs onto you like a hook! The Uncanny Counter is amazing, one of my newly found favorites. I looked forward to every weekend just so I could watch this show and figure out what was going to happen! A true nail-biter!

The plot was nicely done, I felt as if I understood everything I needed to know, and the progression of the characters was quite lovely. The highlight of this show, in my opinion, was the friendship. Onto character progression, Hyukwoo had a nice character progression, as he went from being a huge bully, and generally just a character you dislike a lot, to the one you start feeling a bit bad for and start liking because he starts being nicer, it was a nice touch. (a bit cliche, but it still gets me every time) I also liked how Mun became a counter out of nowhere, and his progression of becoming better, and settling in with his powers as a Counter, and figuring out all the new things he can do with them. The uncertainties the rest of the group had disappeared as Mun learned.

Uncanny Counter has a pretty good mix of Thrill, Political Corruption, Supernatural, Friendship, and light-heartedness, and it makes the drama itself great to watch.

I love this cast a lot, not just the actors/actresses, but the characters they play as well. They all work well together, and their characters were so nicely fit together, it was almost as if they were a family, and in my eyes, they really are a family. I truly love every member of the Counter squad, they live in my heart. I also love Mun's two best-friends, they are so wholesome and never failed to give me a smile! The casting on Uncanny Counter is splendid, and I couldn't imagine the cast being anyone else!

Overall, I 10/10 recommend Uncanny Counter, it's an amazing show, and I would, and probably will rewatch it again down the road. You will not regret watching Uncanny Counter!

This drama was a pleasant surprise. I'm usually up-to-date with upcoming and on-going Korean dramas, but somehow The Uncanny Counter managed to escape my radar upon release. Aside from seeing news about the viewership ratings, I knew nothing about this drama before I started watching. I could even say I avoided this drama for the most part because it looked like some kind of full comedy-action film just judging from the cover on Netflix. But oh boy was I wrong. After watching the first episode I could tell that this drama would be special, I was caught completely off guard as I didn't have a lot of expectations. This drama has a surprisingly deep story and the characters aren't one-dimensional. All the relevant characters had some kind of tearjerking backstory which contributed to some of the tears I shed. The chemistry of the main cast is to die for. There's just no way you won't be attached to the main characters once you finish this drama. The Uncanny Counter is a very exciting drama that makes you want to binge-watch all-day. This drama is filled with funny, sad, and action-packed scenes that will have you craving for more.

Flaws? There probably are a few here and there, but I enjoyed the drama too much to even notice. Overall, this drama is a masterpiece, one of the best dramas released in 2020!

A GEM ! but note the flaws
I said what I had to!
This drama is a literal gem. I totally loved all the scenes from the beginning till the very end.

I personally have never read the webtoon, though actually at some point while this drama was still going on—I did wanted to check it out but then I just figured out I can do that after this ends.

Well, not gonna lie, I did had it on hold for a week, guess I just had read too many comments here marking it as ""overrated"", ""boring"" and all so I think that got on me and I actually spent that week thinking why do I actually like the drama?

For the plot, I'd say it's not something brand new but it's not common either. It was pretty decent and likeable. The cast was AMAZING!! The acting—each and every actor did a very good job. Music was sweet too and I would, no doubt rewatch it again whenever I would seek this thrill again.

Also, as for the people looking for romance..guys, you won't even be needing romance in this freaking series. Although it does have a few cute moments of the two counters here and there and they're just the right amount believe me—so they don't overdo it since OCN doesn't focus on that.
Apart from that, the last episode was damn refreshing to see everything back at it's place.

Give it a try, you won't regret it. :)

Edit: I wanted to write the flaws I found too—firstly, the plot doesn't answer many unanswered questions. As the season ended I realised this *sigh* It could have been much BETTER ngl. But as we say, nothing's perfect but this drama sures keeps you waiting with all the cliffhangers!

Refreshing show, awesome beginning, Ok towards end
Story:
The show started off very strong and I had a very good time watching it. There was mystery, humor, emotions and fantasy all together. The characters had good progression. I really liked how they incorporated humor in the show while maintaining the victory good over evil scenario. It was also nice to see how each team member was becoming closer and like a family to each other that made it heart warming show as well. But this was mostly in the first 2/3rd of the show.

In the last few episodes, the team bonding moments and the humor took the sideline, plot had more loopholes, focus was mainly on villain and not on individual characters and it became a bit predictable which made the last few episodes an OK watch.

The acting was good. I can rewatch it because of the acting and the characters.

Overall it's a good show.

A pleasant surprise
I started watching this show just because netflix started displaying it for me non-stop, but I didn't regret any second of it. Once again I was totally captivated by the main characters, and it was a joy for me to follow them throught this journey of self-discovery and self-forgiveness. I wasn't expecting to cry as much as I did cause, when I first started, I thought it would only be about four people hunting demons, but it came out to be so much more than that and i loved every second of it. I highly reccomend this drama, even though there were some things on the plot that made me feel they just didn't wanted to bother explaining and some things that were unecessary, they still did a pretty good job. The actors casted are all amazing, the OSTs are on repeat in my playlist now and, overall, it was a very entertaining and heartwarming drama.

Counters trapped in a maze of their own creation
May be I'm swimming against the tide but I have some serious issues with this show.
Not saying that it is a bad show and there were certainly elements which were very well done and some scenes were thrilling, heart warming, uplifting or gut wrenching but it is not perfect, far from it.
One of the biggest problem with the plot was the writer laid down rules that counters must obey while they are hunting evil spirits so that they have minimal impact on the human world. The problem is that the counters kept on breaking them because the bulk of the story is about them seeking revenge or meddling with societal issues. It got very awkward and painful to watch as they constantly tried to bend the rules or fix damages a la wiping people's memories and healing the wounded baddies. The writer ended up just throwing the rules away mid show by having the counters appeal to their handlers to let them have a free hand. It made half the show felt claustrophobic.
Another issue were the villains used. In the beginning of the show, school yard bullies were the main antagonists. It starts with typical bullying and extortion but it quickly escalated to attempted murders. Just remember these are technically minors. The Rules made all the counters' corrective actions meaningless. Those bullies were behaving worst than the thugs and gangsters used later on in the show without being possessed by evil spirits so why were they so nasty? It got real bad for the junior counter until the problem was pushed aside by his ultra rich benefactor. So all the special powers of the counters achieved nought but money and connections did. Consider how much the show was about money, corruptions and secrets, this was sending a very confused message.
Most shows have plot holes but this show have more than its fair share. For instance, after the counters were assumed killed, they closed their restaurant but continued to live openly inside. The thugs showed up once, rattled the door a few times and said no one is here so they must really be dead. Geez, anyone could have chance upon them for the longest time. Similarly, the level 4 evil spirit was being chased by the police as a mass murder and his face was on TV and posters everywhere. However, once they faked his death and the police made the announcement, everyone seemed to forget he existed. He was walking around everywhere without any disguise. Why didn't anyone noticed? There are a number of other holes or subplots that went nowhere.
The effect of these problems made the middle section of the show seemed adrift and suffer from some kind of identity crisis. All the characters were there and there were great fight scenes, more death and destructions and the odd funny subplots but it doesn't feel like it had much to do with the original uncanny counters concept (aka super heroes vs evil spirits). Maybe uncanny eco-warriors, uncanny thieves? They expended so much energy setting up the central theme and yet it was underused for a good half of the show.
There was also a writer change after 12th episodes. The standard ""creative difference"" reason was given. There was definitely a change in the plot and tone with the last few episodes. The bulk of the last episode was very much sugar overload with resolution of plots and closures for all main characters and even a MiB style makeover for the team.
Generally speaking, the acting were good. The junior counter probably had the most growth but then again, he was stuck in self pity mode for half the show so it was expected. The found family trope was well used and there were good warmth between the fab four. There was little romance, certainly nothing more than wishful thinking.
OST was good, I probably won't rewatch it as the problems would annoy me even more on a rewatch.

Waiting every week was pure suffering, but it was worth the pain
This drama was super engaging despite being a plot I have seen many times before (maybe not in korean drama but definitely in anime) and I fell in love with the entire cast who brought the characters and feelings to life. It feels very authentic and genuine, the friendship is one of the best I've seen, and the development of familial bond truly tugs your heart strings. There may not be a romance subplot between the leads but I think that is for the better, because it was amazing and didn't need it. Romance is not necessary and sometimes just having platonic relationships with people who will support you is enough. The osts are great, I have been listening to them on repeat especially close your eyes by hong issac and meet again by kim sejeong (also the female lead) former member of gugudan.
There's also a lot of lessons to be learned from the show and learn together with the characters as they grow, somun the mc really matures throughout and jo byung gyu portrays him perfectly.
All of the actors are absolutely amazing, talented and wholesome, I recommend watching behind the scenes to really see their dedication, chemistry and cuteness. The performances from the villains and bullies are also extrodinary.
The choregraphy of the fights are decent, the first episode was a little stiff but as the actors went on, it is evident that they have improved.
The plot itself isn't perfect, and some parts thinking back were random or misplaced, but it drives its forward so well that I couldn't care less about its faults.
It was a TRULY a fun ride!

A Different Story and Is Great.
A suspense mystery and the characters in this drama constantly keep you on the edge of the seat for every episode. There is action and suspense that make you shake and were you get scare and close you eyes because you do not know if you want to watch the scary thing on TV. In every scene you want them to succeed in their mission. You get angry when they get punish for doing the right thing and villains keep getting away with murders. Each member of the team has their own story that you follow along and support each character. The actors are great in their performance that makes their character believable and it sucks you in to the story and what they are doing. The chemistry of the team was great so the actors had a great chemistry. It is a different story and I have enjoy it. great script and special affect.

When ghostbuster meets exorcism and superpower
You probably had heard that this drama has received the highest rating in OCN. It really did live up to its hype!

«Warning!! : This drama contains a lot of explicit scenes of bullying, suicide & murder. So if you are easily triggered by these type of scenes, don't watch it. But don't worry it's a drama with certified satisfying & beautiful ending!»

Story : You must have read the plot, so I'll just explain my impression. As a drama that is based on webtoon, the production team & the casts really executed the story perfectly without any cringe scenes. Even if you don't actually believe God, demon or the other realm, you will find yourself enjoying its premise-where scientifically unexplained phenomenons happened. This drama is actually the 'mild' version of ""The Guest"", where the main conflict is not that suspenseful, but every episode is filled with actions, surprises, plot twists & chills.
Love the relationship between Eonni Gang (they are indeed family that came from forgotten people) and the three musketeers (their friendship is beautiful & sincere :"") ). This drama contains incredible side stories & one big main conflict that involved with politics & power struggle.

But I must say, there are few plot holes that I must point out (Spoiler alert!!) :
1)Why So Mun could not heal himself in the last few episodes, as Dongpal's soul has entered his body?? Doesn't that made him a counter with two spirits?
2)So Mun's identity as a high schooler is often forgotten. Doesn't his school looking for him?

Casts : 10/10 Absolutely, marvelously, super duper magnificent!! They are very professional, full with emotions, very lively & successfully made the viewers delved into their characters. Props to actors that played So Mun, Cheong Sin, Myeong Hui & of course Sejong!! Every one did their best & I could not imagine any actors played their characters. Hopefully the casts will stay the same in S2.

Cinematography : Da bestt!! I love how the CGI really blends with the scenes. Every scene was shot beautifully.

Music : Not really paying attention to the osts as I was really focused on the plot, but I love the BGM on Jang Mul & Motak's scenes came out. They were chosen & placed perfectly!

Values : Same with ""The Guest"", in every person, live their own demons-their past, their hidden identity, their pain, their secrets, etc. If we wanna win, we must control that emotions, embrace the demons & learn to be a better person every single day. There's always hope in every darkness, believe in yourself & respect, don't underestimate simple things in life (like having dinner with your family or even their existence)

Conclusion : WATCH IT GUYS!!! You will not regret it! Be prepared as you will binge watching this drama. Prepare your snacks, tissues (the 2nd half of the drama is filled with heart breaking scenes) & blanket!

Would rate it 9,5/10. ❤❤

Noodle house superheros gain a cinnamon roll and take over the world (or my heart, at least)
The action and fighting sequences in this show are very well done. There is the occasional FX that is clearly TV budget quality, but overall the production quality is high and all the hand-to-hand fighting is choreographed with delightful intensity.

I love this show. Does it have it's faults? Yes. It undeniably drags a little in the second act as it runs around chasing political intrigue when all you really want is to see the Counters go kick some more demon butt (or get theirs kicked, the show handles both scenarios great). There are also way too many scenes where bad guys are sitting around just talking about things, taking precious screen time away from the much more interesting main cast. BUT I can overlook it's flaws because they are far overshadowed by its strengths.

I think there are two distinct areas where this drama shines. One is the very well handled action sequences and undeniably pulse-pounding moments of peril, defeat, and triumph. The other is the incredible beauty of the show's main set of characters, brought to life by a super talented cast. Mun is the perfect protagonist for this show, managing to put the sweet in cinnamon roll without coming off saccharine as he surges and stumbles through relatable struggles and missteps along the way to powering up and figuring out both what he can do, and how to use it. Hana, Motak and Maeok too are all beautifully acted characters who you get to see slowly transform from enjoyably quirky stereotypes to layered, fleshed out individuals with their own stories and struggles to uncover. I particularly enjoyed Hana's character development and how you slowly start to see what's behind her protective walls. Also - MAN can that gal fight!! I really appreciate how she is so very competent and skilled and yet still manages to have vulnerabilities and struggles that pull you in and make you worry and root for her. She is high on my list of favorite kdrama leads.

The found family aspect of this show is beautiful and heart-warming, and extends beyond just the main cast. I really enjoyed the relationships between Mun and his friends, and his grandparents as well.

Overall, I'd say this was a compelling, relatively unique drama that takes hold of your heart and never lets go.

Deserving of high praises and top rating
""The Uncanny Counter"" (2020) Season 1 was a live-action adaptation of the webtoon (""digital Korean manhwa"") entitled ""Kyeongirowoon Somoon"" (2018) by Jang Yi. It stars Jo Byung Kyoo, Yoo Joon Sang, Kim Se Jeong, and Yeom Hye Ran, as the Counters--people who hunts evil spirits.

The multiple story arcs were well thought out and I was amazed with how these different stories perfectly fit together in the end which brought out the best in the characters and the moral lessons of the series. The casting and acting for the four lead characters were so good it was as the audience witnessed a true story.

The music, overall production, editing, and directing, were all superb. The choreography in the fight scenes were not lacking and were not overdone, simply fitting for four ordinary individuals to do; otherwise it would have been unrealistic.

Finally, and it is rare to see this in most Asian dramas, they ended the series properly leaving an option for a sequel or a new season. Stories should not be sealed--leaving no room for the audience to create their own continuation, which in turn also leaves no room for an official sequel.

Since it was already announced that season 2 was given a green light, it further proved the importance of ending a series with room for the future. Well done. I will be waiting for season 2.

Great Stuff!
While some may find The Uncanny Counter confusing, especially if you haven't watched many dramas of it's genre, I believe that the majority will love watching this. A very heart-warming and emotional story that will make you feel any and every emotion? You got it. From happiness to sad, from anger to sorrow, The Uncanny Counter will make sure you experience a rollercoaster of different emotions.

A cast that really has great chemistry alongside an addictive OST combines this to be a must watch!

Exciting, Heartwarming, & Fun
I did not read the webtoon or heard of it before watching this, but the story really interesting and grabbed me right from episode 1. The counter team's chemistry is really just so amazing and cute which really added to the entire experience of watching them work together to catch evil spirits. The acting of the entire cast really did an incredible job of bringing the characters to life, especially Jo Byung Gyu. He really is such a talented actor and this drama, though it was his first main role, really showcased his superb acting skills and ways of conveying emotions to the viewers through the screen. I will be sure to keep an eye out for his future works and season 2 of this.

More importantly, the plot/story and character development were consistent throughout the 16 episodes (though the writer did change for the last 4 episodes). There weren't any huge differences from the change in writers or at least for me personally. It was really fun watching So Mun grow as a counter and learn from his choices. His strong powers as a counter were also so exciting to watch on screen. I had many favorite scenes from their fight scenes. Some particularly gave me the chills because it was so unexpected and dramatic. There were also a good amount of emotional scenes that made me cry for every one of them- notably the last episode.

I am hoping that the entire cast and crew will return for season 2 and I am curious what kind of story they will be showing us next.

AMAZING
from the story line, to the casting.. it's amazing,
I am a fanatic of kdramas and this one i will give a grade of 10 stars..
There isn't any boring episode that you would dare to skip.

IT always leaves me amazed and wanting for more. The dilemma of always watching ongoing dramas.
I always find my self checking if new episode have been uploaded.

It's a combination of comedy, drama, action, fantasy, suspense. What else could you ask for, even the most serious character is funny haha..
I highly recommend you watch this series.

MY THOUGHTS about The Uncanny Counter.
Though this Drama is still ongoing. I want to share my thoughts about this Drama: (HOPE THIS HELPS!)
So this is my points about the drama: (THIS MAY CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF THE DRAMA)

1. So first of all this is a fantasy, action, and mystery drama, yet it suited my taste even if I don’t usually watch these kinds of dramas.

I am a person who is more into slice of life and romance-comedy type of dramas. I only watched this for Sejeong (because I love her). But along the way, as I watched the drama, I not only fell even harder for Sejeong but I fell in love with the whole cast, the story, and the fantasy world that they live in.
I love how every episode makes me feel like I’m riding a rollercoaster. At first, I would be pumped up because of the action scenes, and the next minute I would be laughing because of the counters humor and funny scenes and then getting emotional and sad because of its family fond scenes. This drama was really well written and it balances out everything and makes you full.

2. Acting of the main leads (Kim Sejeong, Jo Byunggyu, Yu Junsang, Yeom Hyeran) as well as the support roles.

Kim Sejeong, based on what I have seen of her. She is really improving exponentially. From her first main role in School 2017 to up till now I have seen her progress. She really brings out the character Do Hana, from her bubbly personality in real life to her coldness in the drama. Also, her passion and hard work really paid off as I can see that she has done most of the action scenes which I think this shows how dedicated she is to acting. Hoping to see her on more TV shows.

Jo Byunggyu, though I haven’t seen much of his works (only sky castle). But based on what I see right now, I can see that he is an amazing actor who really has that charm of completely emerging his self to his role. I really love him as Somun! It totally fits him as the innocent and cute baby of the counters. His expressions were well executed and how he also does those stunts and action scenes which shows his dedication and hard work.

Yu Junsang, I also haven’t seen his dramas :( But I really like him here as Ga Motak. He has totally played this role really well. Junsang has really been working hard in order to match Ga motak who’s rigid in terms of physical appearance and attitude and after seeing him more in the drama... I fell in love with his character. This just goes to show how good he played his role. (PS. He's ripped yet he’s 51 years old, call that dedication!)

Yeom Hyeran, I have seen her in drama’s where she was a support role. This is the first time I saw her as a main role and I like her very much as Ms. Cho. I love her expressions when she is worried, mad, and even sad. She also has to do a lot of running in this drama and I can say that she has done a lot for her role(actions) considering that she is not young anymore. Major respect to Hyeran's passion for their action-packed drama!

Support Roles: (I can’t give critic to everyone. So I will be only discussing those people who has gotten my attention)

Lee Jiwon and Kim Eunsoo:
I really love their portrayals of desperation to save one another from those bullies in their school. I also love their cute friendship scenes with Somun (It makes you feel good and relax). All in all, I love them as Somun’s friends in the drama. They truly bring out the characters that they were given.

Jung Wongchang, Kim Yeonwoo, and Kim Yonghan:
Gotta hand it to them, they really played their roles well. I really got mad at them to the point that I want to reach out from the screen and choke them. Which is a good sign for me! (meaning that they played their roles well)

3. Music:

The background music was good. Their music for action scenes, emotional moments, happy moments, and many more. I like them all it fits right to what I want to feel.

1st OST is a rock type of music which is sung by Isaac Hong. Even if I don’t know much about this singer. After hearing the OST, I could say that he has an amazing voice. The belts that he does in the song gives you goosebumps. Also, the song really fits the genre and type of the drama.

OVERALL THOUGHT:
As of now, I am really really loving it! Each episode is like a treasure box full of different stuff in it. We get to feel a lot of emotions in just an hour. Also, I just recently finished watching Episode 6 and it was amazing again! Each episode makes me want to yearn for more!

THIS IS A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DRAMA!!!

Good plotline with very cohesive characters that satisfy
The thrill, action, affections (not romance) and the supernatural are mixed in perfect ratio to make the emotional rollercoaster to make you long for more. If your emotion have been numbed by overused cliche plots, you should watch this to see how the masters do it.

Plot: Being a webtoon, the plot is expected and not out of the world. Yet it is executed so damn perfectly that you can't complain. With the progress of main plotline (to find the reason behind the death of MC's parents, and hunting the evil spirits) there are many subplots (school bullying, corruption of the city, muder mystery etc.) But the subplots are not independent of main plot and contribute to the progress of the main plot.
Special applause to the script writer for not messing it up and not overusing the common troupes.

Character development: generally you need to in coma to become a counter (if you are not the mc). So it is natural that they have a tragic backstory yet it was executed in such a way that it wasn't begging for your sympathy. Just enough to keep you invested in the characters. As well as the backstory of the evil spirits or the motives of the corrupt politicians and businessmen are explained just enough to make you resent them.
Then again it is a special applause to the script writer not messing it up and pacing it perfectly so that it doesn't become boring.

Acting: Wow! It's perfect. Se-jeong is the best tsundere noona, jung-sang is the perfect angry-young ajushhi, Hye-ran is caring old ajumma and they perfected their character to the point of no criticism. They doesn't look forced, not even broke the mold when they act out of their character's comfort zone.
And Jo Byung-gyu is not the perfect one but did a job well done. Other than the time when he is crying for himself, he perfect. The anger, the resentment, the friendship with his school friend, the shy moment with beautiful noona, he had executed it perfectly. He is the mc you want to support.
And yes, you want to give a smack to the villains.
P.s. Ahn Suk-hwan is best as big-boss

Yup I, too, like the cliches. The rainbow-farting overused oily drama is my main food but the new year is here, so I should atleast try to make a resolution to eat healthier. And UNCANNY COUNTER is just the right food.
Try it. You won't regret it.

If your into action, you’ll like this very much
I am in love with this story plot. Not only did he transform from someone who thinks he’s weak to someone who finally knows how to control his self. He gains family along the way and a potential love interest. He helps those who aren’t entirely bad become a better version of themselves. It gives you a drama you wanna watch over and over and over again. I’ve watched it 4 times over. You may experience a few tears but, it’s enough where it’s not overwhelming. It also has comedic parts to it, that will make your stomach hurt from laughing to hard. It can also teach you about controlling your emotions for the better of yourself in the future. Don’t let anger drive you to danger, use your anger to help defeat evil.

Managed to get into my top 5 kdramas!!
I cannot explain just how good this drama is, i finished it yesterday and just had to come review it. Everything from the plot, to the cast to the music is absolute perfection in my opinion. Not only did this drama manage to combine comedy, action, mystery and thriller, it did so without making it feel rushed or incomplete.
I have to first applaud the acting here: I've always loved seeing Yeom Hyeran in supporting roles before and her being a main role here made me so happy and after watching it all i can safely say there is no better to play Choo Maeok. She really brings out this character to the best it can be and really portrays how strong Choo Maeok is, especially in front of her squad. Do Hana was probably one of my favourite characters on the show alongside a few others and Sejeong's performance was top-notch here. She conveyed how complex Hana's emotions are whilst showing how collected and calm she is on the outside. Jo Byunggyu playing So Mun is all i ever wanted because he really brings the character to life, and i'd be lying if i said the crying scenes didn't make me cry as well. Ga Motak is quite literally the epitome of strength, both physically and mentally and the bond between Motak and So Mun is so heartwarming. The Counters are amazing but i think the evil spirits deserve all the recognition too, especially Baek Hyanghee who i loved, perhaps even more than the main evil spirit Ji Chungsin.
The action scenes keep you at the edge of your seat whilst the scenes between So Mun and his friends and the dynamic between the Counters make you laugh and that is the best part about the drama.
The story is so well thought out that you can't really fault it and i love how the drama doesn't just show Chungsin as a 2D evil character but shows his story and makes him much more interesting.
All in all, i recommend everyone to watch it, you won't regret it!! And i'm so happy that season 2 is coming!!

An Enjoyable Encounter
I thoroughly enjoyed this show. I managed to finish this in two days, which only means that I loved the different emotions it brought me. It’s been a while since a show was this successful in mixing different theme and genre in one. This show brilliantly presented and successfully intertwined reality, fantasy, politics, exorcism, family, friendship, afterlife, and so much more.

I won’t mind another season of this show. I really loved it! Kudos to all who brought Uncanny Encounter to life. This is one of the best shows I watched so far this year!

Action packed, emotional and funny
The Uncanny Counter is an action-filled drama, having both emotional and light-hearted moments.

I really liked the relationships between the Counters. They're a found family - they bicker and banter, but in the end they have each other's backs. I wish the show explored more about their partners in Yung. I liked Mae-ok's backstory about her son, which played a big role in the communication between Yung and the Counters. I felt like Ha-na and her partner rarely got any screen time, so I'm not that sure about their relationship. I really liked Mo-tak's backstory and his involvement in the police force. I think it really gave more depth to his character. My favourite thing was how So Mun didn't abandon his friends the moment he gained his Counter powers. He still stands up for them and hangs out with them, which was really sweet. A shame he has to hide a lot of what he does, but at least there are people who care.

I really enjoyed the first half of the show, but after episode 12, the plot really began to drag on. There was a lot of unnecessary exposition and the show seemed to lose its direction in the second half. I really didn't like how they randomly introduced a character only to kill him off half an hour later. It seemed like the show writers were trying to elongate the show just for the sake of it. I read that they had to change writers halfway through filming, so that could have contributed to this problem.

Overall, this show is definitely worth watching. Although it does get a bit boring and strays away from its roots, the emotional finale makes up for it.

A solid storyline with memorable characters and fantastic acting
This was my first time watching a superhero -style drama, and it definitely set a high bar for me. The writing was exceptionally good, focusing more on the relationships between the characters, as well as individual development not just for the sake of the plot, but for better understanding of each character's actions and motives.

Ji Cheong Sin stood out as a memorable antagonist, with the actor's creepy rendition of his final struggle between himself and the spirit that possessed him. His arc was well paced and as a viewer, I was thoroughly invested in the whole thing. Baek Hyang Hee, as well, was a formidable antagonist that carried her own weight, even though she was a minor character. Her struggle with Hana was well thought out, with the two as polar opposites but evenly matched.

Each of the Counters had their own stories, and losses, which were introduced in a heartfelt way. From Mo-tak's heartbreak, Ms. Chu's grief, and Ha-na's guilt, each time we learned more about them my heart broke even more.

The mayor's drama was a little too drawn out, in my opinion. Towards the end, I started getting bored with Noh Chang-gyu and Cho Tae-sin's infighting, though the scene with the water bottles was one of my favorites. I liked that the serious tone of the story was sprinkled with some absurd humor to lighten the mood and remind us that all is not lost.

Great TV series
Finished watching this TV series a few weeks ago and I loved every episodes. The main character was so loveable and I was rooting for a happy ending for him. Certainly felt every emotions he went through in his journey to get a closure about his parents death.

Each main character is unique and they made watching the program enjoyable with their sense of humour and character. The badass character was really good looking and played his part really well. Good looking bad boy!!

Exciting program which makes you want to binge watching until the end just to see the good triumph over evil. Definitely rewatchable as well. Loved it ??

It's Just A Masterpiece.
The overall script is perfect . The way the story line carry from start to the end is just AMAZING.!!!!!
And the Acting of all actors and actress is perfect.
Especially , Jo Byung Kyoo who played as soo mo , his acting is really skillful.
I become a fan of him from now on..

If you like fantasy , superpowers and investigation, just try this drama. It's amazing!!!!
At first, I didn't expect anyting from this. But after I just finished Episode 1, I attached to it. This drama makes me excited just from the start. And I really love the friendship between Soo Mo and his childhood friends.
And I also love the bond between soo mo and counters.
It makes me feel warm.
Some scene , it makes me emotional and cry with the actors. I want to say the actors did really great job.

Review of “ The Uncanny counter “
STORYLINE:
- I honestly realllly enjoyed the whole concept of this series, now is there still some unanswered questions?? I would say yes. Like for example Why and how did he basically become the portal btw yung and the human world?? Why him?? Now those questions could be answered in the next season but there are some plot holes that were started and never really... finished. Like why did the mayor kill that girl?? But besides the little nagging plot holes, the rest of the show was quite enjoyable. And also I don’t appreciate how they would throw in a character only to off him in the same episode
ACTING/ACTORS:
- Now this is the first drama I’ve seen jo byeong kyu in and honestly I’m impressed. He managed to get me attached to not only him but the people around him too. Nailed the crying scenes like a boss too.
- In fact this is the first time I’m seeing any of these actors and I’m genuinely impressed with their performances.
MUSIC:
- Honestly the ost slapped hard. It was so good that even when I wasn’t paying attention to the music when certain songs came on I would find myself subconsciously singing along.
~ Overall, this was a great, enjoyable drama and I can’t wait for season 2!!

Not cliffhanged but always edged.
Food analogy: Dry but hot and spicy Ramyeon with a little a little to no soup (soup being romance) but lots of veggies and gravy, that even after being unconventional keeps you wanting more.

It was deliciously complex. Although the trope of the story is overused and at the present time, which isn't (heh!) So I look at the storytelling. The storytelling was not perfect, to be honest but it was quite enjoyable.
You can be relate to the motions on a personal level but not be totally engrossed in the story because this is about some supernatural stuff, which is a good thing Coz it gives u space for other dramas and webtoons ( also I watched it while it was ongoing. Sooo.. u may disregard the last line)

The acting was fuvking great, man. I had only seen Kim Se Jeong once, but she was hit. Everyone never fell short.
But the show stealer was LEE HONG NAE.
Damn boy.. he made me sympathetic as well as hate him at the same time.. also hats off for such a well written character.

The ost's are ear pleasing and apt. Good enough to be in my playlist for a long period of time atleast.
This show is a 10/10 for me.

Great action, funny and drama all in one
I didn’t expect that I would enjoy this show. I just clicked on it out of curiosity and was hooked from the first few minutes. Action packed scenes were great, the actors and their doubles were great. It was nice to see the doubles featured with the stars at the end of the show.

It was funny in a not slap stick kind of way. The dialogue was witty and how the actors delivered it with their facial expressions was what made it funny. This group of five Counters was what you’d call team work. They were there of each other and loyal. Each character had their own issues but instead of being all sulky about it, they were there for each one and supported them through it. Even the two besties were great. It would be great to have friends like that.

It had its drama moments mixed in, but I think the show was well balanced. It just frustrated me that the evil sprits were super strong and it took everything from the Counters to defeat those but I guess we would have had a shorter drama if the evils were defeated too soon.

Nice wrap up to the story though. All in all a very good one.

100% RECOMMEND!!
Currently this show is in my top 3 favorite dramas!The casting was genuinely perfect for each character and i couldn’t stop watching since each episode left you with more questions that needed to be answered. With the episodes being an hour long, there was never a dull moment where I felt the need to skip through scenes. The ending did feel a little bit rushed ,but the show would have dragged if they did it any other way. The sound track was kind of loud in some scenes (where it distracted from the show) but imma just sum it up to me having ADHD. Overall this show made me feel many emotions (mostly sad) and I will eventually do it all again.

Uncannily Amazing
If you like Fantasy-Action with a young protagonist in a team based setting kicking a$$, then you would love this drama. It is somewhat similar to the anime Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer, minus the killings. The drama was unexpectedly good with a deep storyline (or maybe it is actually expected seeing it was adopted from a webtoon). As someone who hadn't read the webtoon, I don't know how it is compared to the webtoon, but as a drama it was amazing.

The drama had everything a good drama should have. It had happy moments, sad moments, funny moments, serious moments, it had everything and they were properly balanced. The characters were well written with their own background stories as well as the villains. The cast looked great and did a great job in their respective roles. The protagonist had a lovable and funny character and the team mates were unique with their own charms. The OST was beautiful. The VFX was good too.

Overall I think it is a very worthy watch if you like action fantasy dramas and should give it a try for sure.

Fun, Sad, Friends, Family, Demon Hunters, Demon what else do you want, this may just have it
I had this on my list for a while I am a person that gets afraid easily watching demons and spooky stuff but I am so glad I finally watched this. From the cast, characters, and story line it was all so good. Even with having demons in it, they had a lot of humor that you may be a little scared but in the next scene you would be either smiling, or concerned for the characters that you are on a emotional little ride. I loved the cast and how they ended up being like a family to one another, I loved the friends in this, and I was definitely hoping that the bad guys, and demon's would get what they deserved and that the hero's of our story would win!

Very Enjoyable drama if you want some action, fights, humor and enjoying a group of people the really care for each other!

What's uncanny about 'The Uncanny Counter' is how good it is
I didn't expect to enjoy 'The Uncanny Counter' as much as I did. The series didn't take itself too seriously and the performances were solid all around. I mean, a show about demon hunting is not exactly an original concept treading over familiar territory but the characters are just so gosh darn likable! The fight scenes were well-choreographed, keeping my suspension of disbelief to a minimum, and the season 1 finale was very satisfying. As always, I'm not a fan of the 16 episodes format on Netflix with a run-time of a little over an hour for each episode and padding them with flashbacks among other things. But it proved not to be a deal-breaker...this time. I'm looking forward to season 2.

Waiting for season 2
Overall it was a feel good drama . Definitely enjoyed it. i was obviously supporting our counters but if im to be honest, the evil spirits did an awesome job and i found myself loving them more than main cast. The story was intriguing but there were a few loop holes that made the drama frustrating to watch. In some scenes our protagonists felt lacking in power and decision making. The Most annoying bunch was the heaven team or whatever. They were completely useless other than the fact that they provided powers in my view.

I'm hoping they fix some of the issues in season 2 and hopefully the main cast will all be there . Overall if you want something fun to watch that leaves you in a good mood,this could be it. The drama is filled with superpowers,team work and is family oriented which heartwarming. You'll love it despite some of its small flaws.

Better to watch this series. It tackles everything you want to know about life. The Uncanny Counter is one of the most beautiful series produced by Netflix and i hope there will be another season for this.

Can’t imagine the after life and people who are selected to protect us against evil. The series make you realize the importance of the family, friends and love ones. You will also notice the meaning of trust and forgiveness to them. Maybe at the very start is not easy to forgive anything but justice will prevail soon.

another masterpiece
another masterpiece! indeed I really loved this drama! at 1st I was hesitant to watch this drama but thankfully I gave it a try and it hock me up. the plot, pacing and the story is really good and the ending was perfect it really brings tears into my eyes (take note tears don't usually fall into my eyes by just watching movies or series but there are some exception and this is one of those). the thrill and action never ends a very unique story and I am rooting for season 2. I highly recommend this to viewers who liked this genre!

A really fun watch!
I watched this earlier this year when it just came out on Netflix, after watching a lot of the darker dramas like Alice in Borderland, Sweet Home and Strangers from Hell, I wanted something lighter and “happier”, and The Uncanny Counter delivered just that.

To me, this is a light scifi/supernatural drama with a sprinkle of comedy and also those dramatic moments that make you reach for tissues. I like the unique take of the grim reapers / demon hunters, because they are ordinary humans who sell noodles at a popular local noodle house, who also acquired curly hair once they become a Counter. I love the characters in these series, and their relationships are adorable, I especially love So Mun’s relationship with his best friends Ung-min and Ju-yeon as they have a solid, unbreakable bond. Also, can I just mention how much Yeom Hye-ran kicks ass in this? It’s awesome to see more of her in this.

Overall this is a fun series to watch, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the drama concluded nicely too.

Rewatch value: I almost never rewatch anything, and same goes with this one, but I do love some of the fight scenes, so I wouldn't mind rewatching some of the fight sequences.

A Kick-Ass start !
I appreciate So Mun's character development in the series. From a high school kid who is unable to control his emotions, he learned so much from being a Counter. From the very start, he's more powerful from the others. I didn't expect the ending though! He was possessed by another partner spirit. It never crossed my mind that it would be possible. What a twist! So he's like the most powerful counter now?

I also appreciate Se-jeong here! I love her ever since I watched her from School 2017 and seeing her act in this series makes me appreciate her more. This is far from the roles she portrayed before (from cutesy to edgy). Her character is badass here and she is perfect for it. ?

I would like to see more of her and her story in the second season! Especially Mo-tak. They did him dirty by making the love of his life dead. I hated that scene! I was rooting for them! I also prayed that Ms. Chu won't die on this season and please don't let her die even on the next season. Protect her at all cost. ? I also want her to end up with Jang-mul. SHIP! ?

I'm glad that aside from his Counter family and his loving grandparents, So Mun has his loyal friends. They are a big part of his journey as a Counter especially during this early training days. They never left him even he's MIA most of the time .

The first writer left her job after 12 episodes and was replaced in the last 4 episodes. You can easily tell because of the sudden twists. So Mun was the center again and the other Counter's stories are left hanging. I like how the Counters and their Yung partners unite at the mid and ending. Even though they had conflicts in the past.

Son Ho-jun's cameo. This is unexpected but I had the feels that it might not end well and I was right. It still hurts even though we only got to see him in a short period. I really hope they won't lose another member even on the next season. ?

So Mun got the happy ending he deserves. He finally met his parents and this is where we all cried.? Haha! The new writer really knows how to play with our feelings. I almost believed that his parents won't recognize him.

The ending is satisfying as it gave us a proper closure. It also gave us a hint of what can we expect in season two. So why is this a top tier kdrama this year? Watch it so you will know! Haha. It will make you hooked on the first episode and the ending will make you anticipate for the second season. It gathered high ratings as it reaches the ending. The casts are perfect and the story is unique. The fighting scenes are also smooth and badass.

And you read it right! They announced that there will be a second season. Can't wait for it! I will miss watching this series. How about you? Have you watched this series? If not, add it on your list! ?

Masterpiece!
WOW I don’t even know where to start. Action/thriller/mystery fans must watch!

Firstly the cast - so much depth to each character, the actors suited their given roles perfectly and came together like one little family!
The plot - never a dull moment, the fast pace of this drama will leave you wanting to watch more by the end of each episode.
Although romance is not the main genre of this drama, there were many emotional scenes which were portrayed beautifully by the cast, sure to make you tear up :’)

Personally this is one of the best dramas I’ve watched, going to dearly miss Eonni’s noodles and the counter family!

Top Tier Drama
This drama truly peaked my interest. Not only is it a fantasy and action drama, but the characters are well-developed, the villains are frightening, and the action scenes with wonderful elements are well-executed. This team of Korean ""ghostbusters"" is like family, not only as a couple; throughout the episodes, they have a very tight relationship of trust, closeness, and love, which makes them very appealing to viewers. The experiences capture you, and you can't stop watching because you're curious about what happens next in the plot. When it comes to comic situations, you laugh a lot, but when it comes to tragic occasions, you cry a shit ton. It's strange how a fantasy action drama can make you so pumped. The actors are absolutely brilliant. They are quite appealing to me. it is flawless in every way, from the actors to the plot to the action and production. The entire series has no boring moments, and it's a tremendous adventure! So, if you haven't seen it yet, go ahead and enjoy the moment; it'll be gone before you know it!

Ms. Chu is one of the coolest mom figures I've ever seen; it's a shame we only learned about her backstory near the end of the drama, but witnessing her relationship with her son after that made me believe it's all genuine.
Ga MoTak and his sense of justice are so skilled at defying the hunter's laws, and witnessing how he doesn't give up even when rocked is incredible; it's a bad he can't be with the woman he loves.
Do HaNa deserves more in the drama, but there's nothing to shake the notion of what can happen, and it's more airborne than described, but seeing her improve throughout the series is amazing, and SeJong knows how to do it. She is without a doubt one of the best idol actresses I have ever seen in this position.
Su Mun is one of my favourite characters; he grows and evolves during the drama and is able to channel his anger and anguish in order to save friends and family and strengthen his talents; he is without a doubt one of the most powerful, and I like how he didn't let it go to his head.

Entertaining
Every damn scene was so entertaining in this series ! Never did I once felt an urge to skip even 10 secs !

Some good acting and action in can be seen here ! The cast is done very nicely , all of them are so loveable ! Even the villains did a great job ! I just felt the ML annoyed me sometimes , not to be able to control his emotions and let all his team members and friends fall in trouble , but then that's the beauty of his role , that's how its written ! He brings out the emotions very well !

Enjoy it !

OVERALL DON'T HAVE SECOND THOUGHT ABOUT WATCHING THIS DRAM. JUST GO WATCH IT.
100% WORTH WATCHING.. MUST WATCH TOO..
This drama is REALLY I mean REALLY OUTSTANDING there is not even a single episode that makes you bored. Right up from Episode 1 to til Episode 16 it will make you stick to it without skipping for a single minute. The rating given here is really awful 8.8? Really that's bad, this drama should have been rated more than 9.5 because it's THAT GOOD. also this the second drama that i have reviewed from my entire drama-watching years(10 years).
WHEN GETTING INTO THE DRAMA:
All four main characters were fantastic in playing their role but The male lead(Mun) was adorable, awww fell in love with him. his expression, smile, acting, anger expression whole I mean everything about him in this drama was cuteeee.
Even the female lead was admirable and the other two characters that's Ga Mo Tak and Chu Mae Ok were also my favorite characters with Ahn Suk Hwan where he only comes in a few episodes when compared to other main characters.
I would really appreciate the friend's character of the male lead even their cute and also appreciate the other main characters but they are main (other world partners of each character).

EVERYTHING LIKE OST, ACTING, VFX, ARE TOO GOOD

OVERALL DON'T HAVE SECOND THOUGHT ABOUT WATCHING THIS DRAM. JUST JUST GO WATCH IT.

Well executed, thoughtful drama.
This drama, like many others, explores the idea of the afterlife and what happens to people when they pass away. Although a popular concept, I think this drama gives a different perspective and feeling from other dramas - instead of a 'Grimm Reaper' like figure collecting souls, the idea is instead that it is ordinary people.

The 'Counters' referred to in the drama are ordinary people, and they all have different experiences of life, not to mention that they are of different ages. This brings an effective and engaging dynamic as it is not simply a 'school' drama, although the main character is of a school age.

The writers and actors have done a good job of maintaining chemistry throughout the drama, which makes it a nice easy watch, although there are some darker areas of the drama which help to give it a bit more depth.

One thing I would say about the drama is it brings in the concept of one main character who is the 'hero' and essentially more special/gifted/important than other characters, which I think is potentially an idea that has been overused in modern media.

Coolest fantasy drama I've ever watched!!
The first time I saw episode one, I fell in love with this drama. I happened to be looking for a bullying drama and someone recommended this. At first I laughed out loud, but the continuity was balanced. like comedy, sad, excited to get the evil spirit, and about bullying that I'm looking for, it's all there. and maybe if you watch this, episodes 9 and 11 will definitely be your favorites. because I think that's where the peak is. The acting of the actors is really really cool, if they are happy I'm happy too, if they are sad I'm sad too, so it's like entering the drama

fantastic k drama of supernatural thriller genre
this bowl of noodles seems tasty 〜mad supernatural storyline of good v evil and the afterlife、 lots of jumping up and down、 attractive characters with development potential with some old faces from other drama with good dash of Korean humor and bullies facing painful justice 〜I hope it keeps momentum over the 16 typically huge Korean episodes〜YES〜 how do they do it ？just when you think it must be the end another twist happens great drama here big emotion and wrap ups at the end。 for me I think Yeom Hye Ran as Ms Chu takes the best performance award

10 out of 10
This is my first ever review, that I gave 10/10 ratings.

Concept was unique and very intriguing. The creator/writers did a great job, making a whole new world for viewers to enjoy. They were also successful in creating relatable lovable characters.

A world where superheroes can go to school, learn and gain friends, face bullies. Where superheroes do the dishes, cook, eat good food and travel around. Do all these and other mundane things while fighting evil.

I would love to see another season.

Good Enough
Korean Drama "" Uncanny Counter "" is a wonderful blend of action, comedy and family dynamics.

The drama has a perfect atmosphere, almost like a webtoon, with perfect action scenes and a beautiful world built. The drama introduces the universe of the counters slowly and the viewer gets to know it at the same time as the main character. The family dynamics of the small group of the counters were perfect, emotional at times, funny at others. The story is also full of small cases that the counters had to solve, which were interesting and entertaining, while it follows the main 'big' mystery of the case that eventually involves everyone.

The performances were great as well, and everyone had the perfect chemistry with each other. However, the main lead got annoying and tiring to watch when he was struggling to maintain the barrier thing, as it looked a bit fake and overacted. But the rest of his acting was really good. Also, the guys of the 'other side' were overbearing at times.

So, overall, 8.5 out of 10 for this pretty entertaining drama.

A great supernatural drama with one of the best cast chemistry in K Drama world
A great supernatural drama with one of the best cast chemistry I've seen in a while. Uncanny Counter hooked me from the very first episode that I had to watch the next episodes straight after.
This drama is great for so many reasons, it's not a typical rom-com drama for one which already sets it apart from most K Dramas. It has many genres in my opinion. It's not just a supernatural drama. It's also comedy, mystery/thriller and it's packed with action and emotions.

STORY:
The story itself grips you straight away right from the first episode. It will leave you curious and wanting to know more. As the drama progresses, it gets even more interesting and just builds up and up so there's never a dull moment. You'll get drawn in with the main story of the lead So Moon, as well as grow curious to find out more about the back stories of the other counters: Ga Mo Tak, Do Ha Na and Chu Mae Ok. Each episode is well paced and there's never a dull part that you'll wanna fast-forward or skip.

The ending of the drama was really good as well since the minor villains were dealt with before the final episode so it didn't feel like it was rushed or crammed into one episode. It goes to show how thought-out each of the episodes were. Plus it really made room for the ending to be more emotionally impactful too.

CAST:
The chemistry between the counters is really one of the best on-screen chemistry I've seen in a drama cast in a while. They all compliment each other so well in every single scene they share. You could really feel that family-like vibe among them like as if they're a real family or really good friends who've known each other for ages even off-screen. You'll laugh with them when they joke around together and get emotional when when they worry about each other. Their chemistry is just so natural and their emotions towards each other so real that it's just SO GOOD!

The production of the drama is also top-notch. From the action sequences, the visual effects, the editing... everything was just spot-on. The one negative I would probably say is that the final showdown felt a little underwhelming. I felt it could have been more action-y and badass. Saying that, it was still a great fight and the considering all the other action sequences in the drama were great, I can let it slide :D

Overall, I really recommend this drama even if you're not a fan of the supernatural genre because of the cast, their acting, great story, production and even incredible OST. It never gets boring and you'll always want to watch the next episode straight away. There's a reason why it's been picked up for Season 2 after all.

ONE OF 2020's BEST DRAMA!!!
Aside from Kim Se-Jeong and Joe Byeong-Gyu, the reason why I get interested on this drama was because of its genre plus it was produced by OCN. The story line and plot was new to me for this genre because normally, a crime was solved by Police but in this story the Counters are the front runner in catching the culprit possessed by evil spirit before handling them to the Authority. The suspense and trills in watching this drama was not that intense compared to a normal crime drama but you won't mind it since the pacing of every episode, the editing and the effects made here was superb plus the Actors were really great. 2 thumbs up .........

The excitement that NEVER STOPS!! literally


For someone who have never read the webtoon, I just gonna say: this drama is more than just amazing! It took me less than 3 days to finish the whole series simply because I just couldn't stop watching!!!!

From casting, to plots, to action scenes, and production, this drama is a perfection! There isn't any dull moment throughout the series and it's like a thrilling ride! So if you haven't watch it, you should go ahead and enjoy the ride, it will end before you even noticed! As there are a lot of shows with a pretty good start and went down the trail in the second half, but for this one, nope! It gets higher and higher that gives you a lot of anticipation till the end!

You could say it is a comedy, a thriller, a mystery, a fantasy, or an action drama, because it has all the genres in it!

If you are skeptical and worried of horror scenes, I can assure you it's not that scary, I don't fancy horror dramas too but this is perfectly fine for me! But do expect some tense up whenever you see the evil ghosts in action, but trust me, that excitement is just the thing that keeps you going! XD

I really adore the counter squad SO MUCH! Although they weren't related to each other and share different personality, when they come together, they became a bunch of sweethearts that make you smile :) Plus, their acting are really ON POINT that gets you into it! Action scenes or crying scenes, you name it! Never underestimate those young actor and actress; Byung Gyu and Se Jeong totally slayed it!

I would say they had a pretty good production too, literally nothing to pick on! Besides the action scenes, I really love how the male lead was summoning out the Territory, those colour effects!!! Gosh so heroic and I love it!!!!

Well since I couldn't name anything that I don't like about the show, it gives an absolute 10/10! Or maybe one bad thing of this drama is that ""It ends""!!! I heard they are having a Season 2 and I can't wait for it! Definitely one of the best dramas I have seen in the past year!!! Highly recommend :)

Really great story and acting!!
This was such an amazing drama!!! The actor that played Ji Cheong Shin was crazy good! I hope he gets a lot more rolls in the future because of his great acting in this show. The acting in this show as a whole from all of the actors was top notch. Every emotional part made me cry and hit me just as hard as the writer probably intended for. Personally I was happy with the non-cliffhanger ending. Although it was kind of lackluster I enjoyed how it didn’t leave me emotionally stressed lol. The whole fighting sequence at the end was so satisfying and made me fangirl so much over the characters lol! 10/10 show. I think this drama had just the right amount of comedy, action, and emotion. I really suggest this to anyone, it is a great watch!

enjoyable and entertaining
i mainly watch this because there's so much hype over this drama. overall it's a good drama, have enough suspense to keep you interested. all the actors did a very good job portraying their character. the story line however is not as good as the acting. There's so much backstory for each characters that's not being explain very well. I would give it better rating, if they cut unnecessary slow motion repetitive scene, and give better indepth explanation on each characters story. But as it was adapted from a comic, what can you expect.

I didn't read the synopsis...
...before starting this drama. I went in not knowing what to expect, but I was up to my head with watching horribly written plots and bad acting that I was desperate to try anything. I was more than pleasantly surprised to stumble across this gem.

Plot; This plot was well thought out, nothing was questionable, no plot holes to be filled, everything flowed at a steady pace, and there weren't too many flashbacks to draw out the scenes.

Characters: Each character was fleshed out, even the main villain wasn't one dimensional...as an audience we can even empathize with him to some extent. If I would have to question anything about the characters, it would be about the ones in Yung...but since there will be a part two, I wonder if they will go into more details about those characters and what their motivations are.

If you are like me, someone that's watched a bunch of dramas and seemed tapped out, this may be the one that can get you going again.

Disappointing
Though I enjoyed the plot theme, I really had high expectations from the characters and the story. The counters and the other world partners are shown to be pretty weak considering the incredible powers they actually possess.

To begin with, Wi Gen, the other world partner nearly died as she began aimlessly searching for a body to enter. When she finally does collid with So Moon's body, the ensuing scene is comical and almost silly.

Also, the writers probably wanted to create a powerful adversary but it just ended up making all the counters look incredibly weak and helpless. The other world partners also seem to be dishing out unjust punishments to the counters which was upsetting. Some of the aspects in the lead up to as well as the final battle itself were frustrating to watch (eg. The car scene).

The story started off pretty strong but towards the end, I started to lose interest. I completed it nonetheless. Probably not a show I would watch again nor recommend as there are a lot of better options.

It's a drama about love, loss, and epic fights!!
I just finished this drama and I am not the same, nor will I ever be. I thought going into this that it was similar to the drama Black, about grim reapers and stuff like that, and I didn't like Black. I couldn't stand how slow Black started and continued to be.
This, however, was never dull. Not one dull moment. It's action packed, funny, and sad in all the right places. I cannot recommend this enough!! It deserves so much and more for how much love I have for this. I do wish there were a few romantic moments here and there, but at the same time, it does so well without it.
There is a page about it getting a season 2. I don't know if that is true, but I don't think it could continue on to a season 2, like other dramas could. There isn't really a cliffhanger for there to be a season 2, but we shall find out. That being said, I must say it is now one of my favorite dramas of all time.

Easy to watch
I enjoyed this show from start to finish - this was a really good show. The story was engaging, as were the cast. I thought the acting was good and I like how even some of the side dramas all had endpoints far bigger than just being subplots. I was underwhelmed, badly, by the ending in how things were resolved. I felt like sometimes the show built up tension but the pay-off wasn't there. Kdrama shows often fall when it comes to specifically this, and Uncanny Counter was vulnerable to that as much as anything else.

Thank goodness i came back to this drama after thinking of dropping it off. I expected kinda lot from this drama seeing how much it was recommended. and maybe i expected too much from those reviews, and didn't meet what i initially expected. but after some time, i picked it up again and-- god, that was the best thing that i've ever did this month. i'm giving this 10/10 not because it's flawless, but because those flaws where overshadowed by lots of perfection.

i'd start off with the flaws.
- the initial theme of this drama is about this mortals counters who are bound to catch and summon evil spirits. however, i feel like the drama focus much about politics and corruption other than catching spirits. although there's a connection between those spirits and politics, i was just hoping that they kinda stayed true what they are supposed to be. i think they didn't even catch more than 5 spirits? since they focused more on catching Cheong-sin and the girl. i wished they were just more.

- i wasn't too heartbroken by the punishment that they receive because they've violated too many rules even though they have reasons. at some point, the rules that Yung created seems to be mere decoration. although they were punished for violating them, it just feels as if they were beginners to ignore too many rules. but i'm glad that it served as a lesson for them to be better esp Mun since he was getting out of hand at times.

so far those are all the flaws that really bothered me. there are actually more smaller plotholes but i don't want to mention them yet as i'm hoping that they'd be answered by the second season.

moving on to the good points.
- THE WHOLE TEAM. yep. that's right. the best thing in this drama is the whole team and the way that their characters were fleshed out. it's just so rare to see a main lead having such a great chemistry with everyone, may it be Mo Tak, Ms. Chu, Mr. Chairmain and of course, Ha Na. and these people interact with each other in such a heartwarming-- aaaaa, i can't even describe. i want to each and everyone of them safe.

- Hana and So Mun. my god, i can't believe i'm watching an OCN drama. i feel like they're spilling us too much with these heaven sent chemistry that it's starting to make me feel anxious with what they have in their sleeves for the next season. please don't break them apart. come on, OCN, just give it to us for the next season. kidding aside, that subtle teasing and gestures and actions of the two, my god i'm melting. i love the fact that Ha Na's character develop, being more open to people, smiling, remembering her family and of course allowing someone to touch her finally-- yes i'm talking abut So Mun, thank you very much.

- the oh so satisfying revenge and catching ghost scenes. i can't stop myself from laughing whenever they catch those bastards.

- the ending. damn. that start of episode 16? that was the thriller that i've been waiting for in this. i've pinched my sister so hard that we almost end up fighting. lol. that was the best and one of the most satisfying thriller scene, ever. i love the fact that they put back So Mun's limp as he beat the hell out of that devil. and the rest of the episode? one of the best and most satisfying ending ever. i dn't care if it looks like a fan service with all things too good, i think it just stayed true to its theme as this is not like the usual dark and twisted OCN. i couldn't ask for more with that ending.

i've never had the urge to rewatch a drama after watching this (i don't rewatch). and i will surely be waiting for the second season, hoping that it would focus more on them catching ghost and some progress *ehem* Ha Na x Mun *ehem*. this is definitely a drama for you if you're looking for something suspenseful but lighthearted and comedic toned.

Recommended, But with Reservations (Mild Spoilers, nothing too revealing!)
I've never been more conflicted on scoring a K-drama series. My watching partner (aka wife) and I are also divided on this score, which is very unusual. In the end, I had to look at how we'd scored other series and let my personal tastes have more of an influence than usual.

[Note: Using MDL spellings for names rather than Netflix's. Apologies for throwing in many Japanese manga/anime terms, but I can't find the Korean equivalents relevant to manhwa.]

Good:
Great cast and acting, good story overall, decent VFX and production values, some really great, memorable characters, a very fun watch, a lot of action.

I loved that the core team is an age-diverse group of unique characters with good motivations and backstories. They reveal much more about themselves as the story progresses. I actually could have used a lot more of just them casually interacting in the noodle shop, teasing each other, training, whatever.

Not-so-good:
A hero who's a bit too prone to completely falling apart, a few underdeveloped or weak supporting characters, some side stories that aren't as interesting as others, the overall concept has a lot of holes and inconsistencies, the ending and resolution are very weak and dragged out, some very inconsistent depictions of main characters, some missed opportunities.

(Light spoiler, but kind of funny: It really seems at one point that the MC, So Moon [Cho Byeong Kyu] is trying to exploit a sick child for BTS tickets. Dude. No.)

Do Ha-Na's (Kim Se Jeong) temperament is a bit all over the place. Her backstory is never fully realized, but plays a big part in the main plot. She is a great character (classic tsundere) and Kim Se Jeong is great. The script lets her down a bit. Her story could have been left open for a possible Season 2, but there is a lot of teasing and partial reveals that don't work well enough to support her behavior.

In the supporting cast, Kim Jung Young (Choi Yoon Young) has a key role, but her character is disappointingly bland and ineffective, even compared to many much more minor characters. She's so poorly depicted, I often felt bad for Choi Yoon Young for having to go through the motions of playing the role.

Similarly So Moon's friends feel like they were copied and pasted from a show with a total different tone. This makes some of what happens to them rather disturbing. It's also a bit weird that Im Joo Yeon (Lee Ji Won) is clearly the only actual teenager playing a student, and is surrounded by actors almost twice her age. It's common to have actors play many ages, but throwing someone so conspicuously young into the cast makes the difference very noticeable.

Normally, these issues would have been enough for me to score Uncanny Counter in the 7.0–7.5 range.

But… This one has specific appeal for me:
Uncanny Counter has a plot and premise very similar to many popular Shonen manga and anime (as well as manhwa influenced by those, including the original UC webtoon). It should be very familiar to fans of Bleach, Rin-ne, Yu Yu Hakusho, Soul Eater, and dozens of other ""empowered people have to fight corrupted souls/spirits and send them to an afterlife dimension"" titles. It takes a lot of cues from these, and the hero arc is similar to almost all of them. There are also quite a few Matrix references, even what appeared to be some Wes Anderson visual references.

So, basically, the roots of this drama are all things I love and was happy to see in this show.

At this point, how I feel about Season One may change after viewing Season 2, coming in 2022. If it offers better story resolution, a tighter script, and giving some characters the attention they deserve, I'd keep Season 1 at 8.0. If many of the first season faults carry over into the next, it may be downgraded to a 7.5.

Predictable but still a lot of fun
I was very surprised at how good this show was. I had it on my list of shows to watch for a while, but I kept putting it off because I didn't think it would be that good. Definitely one of the better dramas I've seen in a while. The story is interesting enough to keep you hooked even though it is rather predictable (I actually enjoyed the predictability of the show, made it more of an easy watch and just pure entertainment).

The characters are fantastic, and all of the actors and actresses did a great job playing their roles. The relationships between the characters seemed very genuine and the chemistry between the lead cast was great. One of those shows with character relationships that just makes you smile. Also teared up a few times watching, there are some very emotional moments.

Overall, somewhat underrated drama with great characters and an easy-to-follow plot. If you're looking for a good drama to just watch and have fun, definitely check this one out. Excited for a season two!

Super entertaining
The Uncanny Counter was really a drama that made me feel thrilled and kept me on the edge of my seat. I could not stop watching once I finish an episode, that is how entertaining it was. Nice choice of actors also. I think their diverse characteristics and traits complemented each other. I don't know about the webtoon so I can't compare the two and how they differ but this one is well-made. Despite being not a big fan of action filled dramas, this one hits different as it added a different flavor to it, which is the realms outside and beyond what humans have. It was interesting, intriguing, thrilling, and sometimes emotional too. Props to the actors for playing their roles well, specially Jo Byeong Gyu. Although has some flaws and slight nonsensical moments, I could easily overlook them because of how good the story and action went. Looking forward to a second season if there's one. Definitely something worth your time, so consider checking this out.

Crime, humour, emotionally intense, all together!
The Uncanny Counter is a drama focused on a group made up of those who were previously in coma, given a chance to fight evil spirits. When So Mun gets included in the group due to special circumstances, things really begin to happen. With more than just how he joined the group being what’s mysterious about him, we’ve a lot to find out. From a political corruption arc to evil spirits being utilised by them, we see our group get pulled into setting things right.

What did I love about this show? The first half was quite well done, the pace was perfect to the story and we got to the intense parts while keeping up with the humour. I also loved the wholesome relationships the group shared. They weren’t one dimensional characters — I loved Ha Na the most. She appears closed off and could be generic cold because of how she is, but with her people we are expressing emotions and being soft. The women in the show aren’t deprived of their feminity to make them appear strong. I also loved Mun’s relationship with his friends — that was another wholesome trio! I’m looking forward to see the young actress who plays his best friend in more dramas. I enjoyed the evil spirits arc for majority of the show. Absolutely loved the dynamics between the crazy female spirit and contract killer spirit, they were the highlight for me I think! I would love to see these two actors in another drama — maybe retaining their characters a bit.

What did I dislike in the show? As the show moved into the second half, there was a certain out of pace-ness in few episodes. Some random ridiculous things happen which make you roll your eyes. I wish So Mun’s powers were more fleshed out. I didn’t get the point of Yung either — there isn’t much information on what they do or what the extent of their jurisdiction is. The way they admonish their counters felt a little stupid, like there aren’t really fixed rules. The development between counters and their yung counterparts could have been much better — especially So Mun and Wigen’s. I also didn’t like how certain characters were introduced or their conflicts were resolved only to be killed.

Overall, this is a fun show. It covers trauma to an extent, there’s bullying as well (what’s a high school oriented drama without bullying though, right?) but there’s humour which balances it. A fun show to watch if you’re in hero saves the day content.

Not Scary
Oh my goodness, I enjoyed this so much. The sad part about this drama was people died but then yet they went to check-in for heaven or that place of fire. The actors who played the counters or demon hunters were warriors in protecting what they needed to protect and rid the city from Demons.


Jo Byung Kyoo, Yoo Joon Sang, Kim Se Jeong, Yeom Hye Ran, and Ahn Suk Hwan did very well in their roles as Demon Hunters and can't see who did better acting than the others, they were all excellent. That big guy demon, OMG, the muscles on him very well shaped! I won't say any more about him... lol but I will... that dude looked evil!

Everything the production, set, visuals, were all good. I loved the Martial Arts in this. Anyway, just watch it. All 16 episodes are complete and on Netflix. The storyline, I applaud the writers! The ending was sad but also good.

Why does this show only have an 8.8 rating?
I adore this show, so so much. I truly enjoyed it so much and had practically no grievances with it. The one or two I have are truly opinion-based and I don't truly consider them as flaws. Shall I begin?
Story, 10/10:
Where to begin? I think the supernatural element of this show is really interesting and I enjoy true crime so I liked that aspect as well. The group of ghost hunters isn't a new concept but I think the way it's done in this show is really fun. My two grievances fall into this category so I'll say it now. 1. I wish they'd kept So Hun disabled and he had learned to fight well despite it. I am most definitely biased since I myself am disabled and walk with a limp. Mine isn't injury based so it's a little different but still. My second and last grievance is that I wish they'd focused a tad bit more on the supernatural parts. They did in the beginning and don't get me wrong, I enjoy the true crime element quite a lot but I would've enjoyed a bit more evil spirit hunting. Also, the evil spirit villain in this show is scary as hell and I hate that high-pitched giggle he does.

Acting, 10/10:
I found absolutely no issues with the acting. I thought everyone was superb and I can't think of anyone whose acting I disliked. My favorite acting probably would come from the guy who plays the evil spirit villain. He is so scary and I get anxious every time I see him on the screen.

Music, 8.5/10:
The soundtrack was good but I wasn't blown away. I've heard better but I've also heard worse. This is on the higher end of the averageness scale. If you want to hear some good drama music, try watching Doom at your service or Hotel Del Luna. Both are killer though I prefer DAYS over HDL.

Characters(I know it's not a category but I'm including it anyway):
My favorite character is So Hun, no competition. He has such a sweet personality and I truly relate to him. I am really emotional and I am disabled so I clicked with him instantly. My second favorite character is Ha-Na, she is so badass. She is also really pretty. My third favorite is a tie between the former policeman and the healer lady. I hate that I forgot their names but that doesn't mean I don't care for them. I hate the villains so much, I can't pick who is more loathable. Also, So Hun's friends are great and I like them a lot.

Rewatchability, 9/10:
I don't tend to rewatch things and I doubt I will rewatch this but that is just me. For anyone else, I think watching a second time would be pretty fun. Not as fun since the suspense would be gone but it would still be fun.

Overall, 10/10:
Please, please, please watch this show. It is really good and I wish more people were talking about it. It is one of the best drama's I've watched and I hope you'll like it as well. But a bit of a warning, it can be a bit gruesome and bloody but nothing too gratuitous.

BRILLIANT SHOW!
Should you? Would you? Could you?

You should watch this one (YES! )
You would recommend this to others. (YES!)
You could watch this again. (Not really as it’s a mystery)
Ending: Satisfactory

This is a South Korean tv series based on the webtoon Amazing Rumor by Jang Yi. There is only one word to describe it and that’s “BRILLIANT”.
While the plot is very interesting (The protagonists running a noodle shop in the day and demon hunting in the night), it’s always the characters who make it come alive.

Everyone has acted brilliantly: the 4 core members (the counters who are the demon hunters), the spirit council, the supporting cast, and the different sets of villains that we encounter. Each counter has a special skill which when coming together as a team, makes a formidable force to reckon with.

In fact, the actors chosen as the evil spirits are just brilliant and lead the show. Lee Hong Nae as Cheong sin is brilliant as the evil spirit. That laughter is so spine-chilling and those eyes...... whew! I liked the fact that they showed a humane side to him at the orphanage but his cruel upbringing is what makes him what he is ultimately. Ok Ja Yeon as the female evil spirit is brilliant too!!!!!!!

SPOILER:
I loved the way the plot changes the game in episode 12 to beat the evil with their own weakness - money and with the concept of divide and rule. This is some good writing here.
While I missed “ Cheong Sin” as the level 3 spirit in the last 3 episodes, Mayor Shin as the evil incarnate is just top-notch.

The character development of So Mun is gradual and portrayed very well - From a soft-hearted person with a disability to a soft-hearted but strong-willed person with a sense of purpose. Even his concern for the Mayor’s son who was a bully to him shows his strength of character. The final episode with So Mun’s reunion with his parents' spirit is very heart rendering.

There is a lot more to this drama. Each character has his or her own journey and I like the way it has been shown while being interwoven within the big plot.

I absolutely loved the background score. It adds so much to the scenes.

There is blood and gore. There are likable characters who get killed. But it's worth seeing this one if you haven’t as yet.
It’s a fast-paced one. Finished it in 3 days. No fast-forwarding in this one. Looking forward to Season 2.

A fun and interesting action, supernatural drama that'll keep you hooked!
I wasn't going to watch this at first, however, after seeing the many positive reviews about this drama I decided to give it a try. And I definitely did not regret it!

In the beginning of the drama, I was sorta confused with what is going on, however, it started to make sense as the story progressed. The friendship between all four characters was definitely real. They really care about each other and would do anything to save each other. However, it was disappointing that Mun and Hana never got together even though they hinted small bits of romance between them. However, this drama doesn't revolve around romance but more of the friendship between all four. There was a lot of funny scenes in here too which made it better!

I don't watch a lot of supernatural/ghost spirit kind of dramas. But this one was definitely an interesting one that kept me hooked the whole time. The drama was nothing too complicating, it was straightforward and easy to understand. Nothing was dragged on because every scene was relevant that connects to the story. Mun lost his parents at a car ""accident"" which left him disabled. However, once he gained superpowers, he found out his parents were actually murdered by an evil spirit and the political higher-ups were somehow involved in it too. AND his parent's souls were taken by the evil spirit, Cheong Shin, who has also killed and taken many other people's souls to make him stronger. Therefore, Mun and the rest of the members had the mission to stop and summon the evil spirit out of this dude in order to free all the dead souls (including Mun's parents) to ascend them peacefully to heaven. Interesting plot right?

The action scenes were one of the best highlights of this drama. The action looked SO REAL! And it's brutal too like damn! I give so much kudos to all the actors/actresses for taking part in such brutal scenes. Kim Se Jeong (Hana) surprised me the most with her martial arts skills. I never imagined she'd be in this type of drama nor see her do these types of strenuous action scenes that maybe not a lot of idol girls can do. She definitely stood out in this drama and give her high compliments.

The antagonists were just brutal and toxic as hell LOL. Like they really hit a nerve that makes you just so frustrated because of the never-ending killing of multiple innocent people. Cheong Shin had a broken childhood and unfortunately got an evil spirit in him. Even though he was dead-beat evil, he showed some soft normal side of himself when he went back to the orphanage to watch the kids play and even defended one of them when one of his mates was about to kill him. It's confusing but at least good i guess to see there's some human side left in him, but he was still dead ass evil and needed to be jailed. But he killed himself so LOL.

The last episode where Mun finally reunited with his parents got me really emotional and teary-eyed. What I love about that scene is that they really made it believable enough to get viewers to feel emotional because it is such a special heartbreaking scene of a kid and their parents reuniting after 7 years from a tragic accident. One thing I was disappointed with was that they didn't really go into much of Ha Na's story. Like yeah we know her family died and she didn't but like.. is that it? We got into the back story of the other three characters and had some resolution to it but nothing very much on Ha Na's part. Or maybe that scene when she was fighting that lady when she ""saw"" her family was a closure? Idk, but that was just me. I guess she had closure that she is fine but just didn't really show it much on here.

Other than that, the whole drama was great and entertaining in general. I would definitely watch this again and highly recommend it to anyone!

Found family and urban fantasy in one? Awesome! I loved the friendship among the characters, not just among the Counters at the noodle shop but also between So Moon and his two friends. I also loved the budding partnership (that was unfortunately cut short) between Kim Jung Young, the female detective, and the young rookie who was assigned to her. Or the strange yet sincere... not-friendship between So Moon and Shin Hyuk Woo at the end.

Speaking of Shin Hyuk Woo, I loved that he got a believable redemption arc at the very end and I cross my fingers that we get to see him again in S2. His character, now that he turned a new page, could be so interesting!

I loved all the main actors, they were amazing, and their characters’ arcs were so marvelous. But who caught me totally by surprise was Lee Hong Nae who played Ji Chung Shin, the big bad of a demon. He was absolutely ah-mazing! He actually felt terribly scary to me. And I do hope that, after showcasing his acting skills here, he will receive many more interesting parts in the future. He sure deserves it!

Refreshing Take On Classic Shounen Tropes, This Time In A K Drama
Whilst not necessarily the most original plot, Uncanny Counter manages to bring the tried and true Shounen format over to Korean television whilst still somehow keeping the story fresh and interesting.

The best thing for me I think I would like to talk about is some of the character writing.

So Mun's base traits are kind of nothing too new — righteous young man with the spirit of a hero and the tragic back story to boot — but the way the world around him works makes him feel like a new character. Generally in these types of Shounen-esque stories main characters are rarely ever presented with the consequences of their actions, and as a result stakes can begin to feel pretty low. Fortunately, with So Mun you can see that the world around him doesn't hold as much of that main character leeway for him, whether it be in his actions or the actions of those around him. This is best exemplified by the rest of the counter team getting strikes put against them and becoming close to being stripped of counter status due to them trying to help So Mun. So Mun also, quite miraculously, doesn't feel too overpowered during the show until closer to the end of the series. This is due, in part, to the fact that his emotionality as a character is his biggest weakness for a fair part of the show. His emotional sensitivity also contributes fantastically into making him feel like a real kid as well. Very rarely do the teens in any media feel like actual teens, but So Mun and his adorable friends are like a breath of fresh air that I, too would beat an entire group of delinquents half to death for if they were kidnapped. Overall I really like the way So-Mun is written, and am looking forward to future character development in the next season.

The women in Uncanny Counter are also all treated with a level of respect that I found to be jarring in the absolute best way possible. After spending the better part of a decade binge watching shows from all over the place, I've gotten very used to women being presented as secondary, not in the way that they're supporting characters, but rather in the way that they are afforded a lot less personality and agency in their own lives. Screenwriter Yeo Ji-na does a fantastic job setting up all of our strong, capable female characters throughout the beginning of the show. Do Hana is both physically and mentally one of the strongest characters in the show, and even though the show tends to let So Mun treat her like your regular love interest a bit too much, Hana is shown to be incredibly independent and well rounded. Chu Mae-ok is a well rounded mother figure, who whilst shown to be the weakest of the counters physically, fills the irreplaceable role of group healer, and is shown to be able to get rough, and also still be incredibly physically strong, instead of being portrayed as just a feeble older woman. So Mun's best friend Joo-yeon is a great beacon of support for him, whilst also being shown to comfortably exist outside of So Mun, allowing her the agency she deserves. Ga Mo-tak's past significant other Jung-young is a smart and capable detective, who has been dealing with extreme workplace sexism, which has tried and failed to relegate her to only doing useless tasks. And Finally the possessed Baek Hyang-hee is one of the physically strongest characters in the show, though she's completely feral, her raw power is something to be respected and feared, which is something the show is quick to remind viewers whenever she comes on screen.

I just absolutely adore all the characters in this show and I feel the character writing misses much less that it gets right with this show.

The casting decisions are also fantastic, for all of the significant (a lot of the delinquents look like their actors' ages... Which is around the 25 mark) characters that are in high school, the casting director chose actors that actually look and feel like real teenagers for once. The chemistry between all the actors is also no joke, the Counters both on earth and in Yung all feel like a cohesive family, and So Mun, Ung-min, and Joo-yeon feel so authentically like childhood friends that you forget all three actors are from entirely different generations. The antagonists in the show are so well cast too, Lee Hong-nae (Ji Cheong-shin) and Ok Ja-Yeon (Baek Hyang-hee) never fail to send chills down your spine whenever they're on screen, and Choi Kwang-il (Shin Myeong-hwi) is so successful at playing the corrupt politician/abusive father that I think he may have ruined any other film or show I see him in from now on forever.

The music in the show is probably the least memorable part of the entire drama, which is really no insult when you take into account how well the music is chosen for certain scenes in the show (A personal favorite music choice of mine is at the very end of episode 4 iykyk).

In conclusion, Uncanny Counter is an incredibly fun, action-packed, emotional Shounen, all packaged into the look and feel of a supernatural mystery K Drama. Over the next few years I'm actually certain I'll be re-watching this show whenever I'm feeling a little bored, so all I can say now is, if you haven't watched it yet, what are you waiting for???

So, we're done watching The Uncanny Counter, and this is a ""rare event"" since I am not an avid fan of K-drama. I prefer C-drama.

Anyway, the series is about a group of people called ""counters"" who hunt down evil spirits dwelling inside people (i.e. these evil spirits actually ""possess"" people and make them do bad things). I can't say anything more since that could spoil the series for you.

I recommend this series. There are some funny moments, irritating moments, and definitely, a lot of sad moments. It's classified as ""fantasy, mystery, thriller"" by Google. I'd classify it as ""supernatural"" --- that word says it all.

You will also see a lot of bullying in this series - as in, bullying in high school - and as I've posted in my statuses before, I noticed that most K-dramas in school settings have themes about bullying. Some of my FB friends who are familiar with the Korean culture said that bullying is indeed rampant in Korea.

The series only has 16 episodes. So you can finish it in two weeks if you watch one episode every day. (Hahaha --- as if! I know most of you binge-watch!)

This is definitely WORTH WATCHING compared to Sweet Tooth ?
It's on Netflix, btw.

Must Watch!!
I loved this drama so much. The production, characters, storyline, and every else was just amazing! It was suspenseful, entertaining, emotional-- and stayed that way through the entire series. I don't usually enjoy action films, but this one was phenomenal. Watching these wholesome, loveable characters battling and balancing the evil in the world was so fun. The supernatural theme was incorporated naturally and the CGI quality was really well done... which is rare for kdramas.

also So Mun is adorable and I'm VERY much in love with Hana ---- all of the actors were incredible and played their parts beautifully

PLEASE MAKE A SEASON 2 IM BEGGING

Perfect blend of fantasy, friendships, humor and thrilling adventures!
This drama is so fun and refreshing!

STORY: I saw this drama was based on a manhua, so I can't write all of the good things off to the writers of the series, but it was still amazing! The plot of this drama is quite unique for Korea, I really like the new things they're trying out. Since it's so completely new for Korea, I really feel like this is a series that could be good for first time watchers of Asian dramas (it's actually the first one I've recommended to my older sibling). The first time I read the description for The Uncanny Counter I actually didn't understand it at all, but I started watching it because it looked so out of left field. I'm sO glad I didn't let the confusing synopsis hold me back! The story is very well paced, it doesn't really have empty moments like most dramas do. I think that's mostly because the focus isn't on romance at all, and I've always preferred a heavier plotline with good relationships that are more in the background but still important to the plot. In this drama, I adored the 'found family' trope used for the group of Counters! The story behind Counters, Evil Spirits and Yung is worked out quite well, with a lot of eye for detail and little plotholes. It's very interesting!
My little sister is watching this drama as well, and she said something I totally agree with: this series will make you cry with laughter one second, and then just make you cry the next.

ACTING: was. great. The cast and characters being the Counters are all very very loveable! The cast does an amazing job at portraying the friendships and family bonds that connect their characters. The main character, So Mun, has become my favorite drama character really fast. He's so cute and genuine and Jo Byung Gyu did such a good job at portraying him. I'm very impressed by the whole's cast's acting, mainly in fight scenes. I obviously know they used stunt doubles too, but even then the cast have quite a bit of fight scenes where their faces are showing, so it's extremely impressive to me. The actors that portray evil spirits were also impressive. Lee Hong Nae, who portrays Ji Cheong Si, is at times genuinely terrifying. He uses his eyes and body movement really well to portray the evil of the spirits. Overall, I want to really tell the whole cast how amazing of a job they did.

MUSIC: Aside from the intro song (the instrumentals), I'm not that big of a fan of the music. I'm never really focused on the OST for dramas, anyway, so this doesn't really bother me. The sound mixing during the episodes themselves is really good, the songs never intrude on the scenes or feel out of place and when they play the intro during fight scenes it's really exciting and fun. The ballads that are part of the OST fit in during certain scenes, but when they use them to play the outro, it's often quite jarring, since most episodes end on a fight cliffhanger. But since that's not really part of the plot, I really don't care. As long as the sound during the episodes is good, it's all good for me.

REWATCH VALUE: Since there's more to this series than just a romance, but rather a web of crime, intrigue, a fantasy plot, good friendships, a found family and good character developments, this drama is extremely rewatchable. I'm really not a rewatcher as well, so this is a big compliment on my part!

Entertaining, but lacking
The story itself is pretty unique, I haven't watched a similar kdrama before. However, my only complaint is that there isn't much of a story, background or depth to it. The characters' backstories weren't well-developed enough. I didn't feel anything when something happened to people close to the main characters. Ga Mo Tak's situation felt like it was inserted into the story to give his character a little more depth, same goes for Ms. Chu and we never really get into Ha Na's story. I just feel like the story and the character's backgrounds could be developed more for me to actually feel something.

The episodes are kind of repetitive, with Mun getting beat up like over and over again over 4-5 episodes. I also would've liked to see more of his friends because their friendship was just goals. I also felt like the last and ultimate fight scene had no buildup or climax, it happened so quickly and I wasn't really satisfied when the mayor got arrested. I was just like meh, whatever.

Overall, I see this drama as more entertaining. I wouldn't really watch it for the plot, but more for the funny scenes

The Energy
HEADS UP: THIS ISN'T REALLY A REVIEW

I usually don't even write reviews but this drama just hit diferennttttt. Supernatural and mystery dramas usually aren't my cup of tea but I just loved everything about this show. Everything from the character development all the way to the soundtrack and overall storyline. Everything felt like it had a connection and you could really feel the ""family"" of the counters in this show. The excitement never stopped and this show kept me on the edge of my seat 24/7.

Emotional Rollercoaster of Amazing-ness
I did not plan on watching this but I did and I do not regret it. This show will capture your heart and make you cry, laugh, and jump in joy at certain times. They convey the emotions so thoroughly that you will feel like crying your heart out t times and other times you will be balling your eyes out. It's an amazing drama since it also depicts various problems such as bullying, abuse, social injustice, and how people held in higher regards can do anything as they're loaded with money. The amount of unfairness in this drama will make you yell at the screen but that is why this is so captivating because it catches your interest, and leave you on the cliffhanger, yearning for more.

Cast: The casting director had the work cut out for them but in my opinion whoever they are, deserves a raise. They couldn't the picked a more perfect cast than this. Jo Byung Koo is an exceptional actor and the emotions he portrayed as Seo Mun's character were so raw and real. You'd believe that he actually knew what getting stabbed felt like, that's how amazing this boy's talent is. I have seen Se Jeong before but I wasn't ever very impressed by her until now because she nailed Hana's character so meticulously that I'm shocked. She is now my favorite actress for being able to pull this character and let's not forget she also sang the amazing OST for this drama. Yoo Joon Sang and Yeom Hye Ran are my favorite ahjusshi and ahjumma ever especially Yeom Hye Ran because her sweetness and motherliness really made me sad at times and she was just wow at portrayed her character.

Story: The storyline is centered around Seo Mun and how and why his parents were killed. I love how they deal with the bullies in this show and the injustice---the injustice just makes my blood boil. I hate how the higher up's can just manipulate stuff and turn everyone. They just go on killing and ruining others' lives without any care as they just go higher and higher on the toadstool. The worst thing is that these things happen in real life but no one realizes cause it's all behind the scenes.

Ending Analogy: Watch it. I don't care what you think, watch it. If you're into mystery thrillers, scenes in which injustice gets overthrown, joy, and a lot of love. It's not especially a romance drama and it's very heartbreaking at times but you have to watch it. It's amazing so you have to WATCH IT!

best of evil soul dramas
Even while reading the plot of the series is certainly interesting. So I want to thank the scriptwriter: Jung Do Yoon and Yeo Ji Na. Korean dramas are becoming more and more popular among evil spirits. There are many series that we enjoy watching, but unfortunately, the series that we are excited about have decreased. Korea is great when it comes to making dramas.
So I want to especially thank you. Director: Yoo Seon Dong. I'm your fan now.
As for the cast, the leading roles are great. actually
Jo Byung Kyoo
(So Moon) This is the first time I've been watching him so closely. but from now on I think I will always watch. the main role made him look very solid.
And the last thing I want to say is that if you are a K-drama audience you should definitely watch this show. If you don't watch it means you have a big loss.

I wasn't going to watch this because it stated it was supernatural and I usually stay away from sci-fi stuff but this series was absolutely awesome!!

From the fighting scenes to the wonderful chemistry this cast had this series definitely deserves a second watch.

I laughed, held back some tears, got angry, got happy-man, this series did so much justice I would be shocked if anybody gave this a low score.

I recognized some familiar faces that played in other series but I wasn't familiar with the two male leads.

Whenever I see a person who has mad fighting skills and I'm unfamiliar with them I will go and find something else they're in and will watch that and I will have to do that because of the two main male leads and the female who also could fight. She was awesome.

I liked the fact that this also didn't have that cliche romance stuff. I'm steering clear of Korean romances at the moment.

I'm glad a season 2 will be in the making but is dismayed that it will come out next year. All in all as I said before, this deserves a re-watch.

Unexpectedly good!
I didn’t know what to expect from this drama. It was either really good or bad because of the fantasy, but I was really curious because it had high reviews.
From the beginning till the end the story was really good. It kept me hooked to watch more and more.
There is no love story, but you don’t even miss that. It’s all about teamwork, trust, friendship and fighting against evil demons. The balance between the older and younger cast is great! There chemistry between the 4 mainrolls are perfect!
I really hope there is gonne be a season 2 ^^!
Watch this if you want to watch some other genre than love. It’s worth it en refreshing to watch.
Love all the characters:).

One of my new favorites
10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020/2021 South Korean fantasy, mystery, thriller series with 16, 70 minute, episodes.

Set in the fictional city of Jungin in South Korea, a group of Counters are charged with ridding the world of evil spirits. The evil spirits posses human hosts who have either committed murder or are evil to the extent they would be willing to. Being possessed by the evil spirit compels the human host to kill and “consume” the spirit of the victim making the evil spirit grow increasingly strong and more difficult to extricate and send on to the spirit realm. The Yung, God like inhabitants in a realm that exists between Earth and afterlife, team with people who are in the half living state of medical coma and allow them to live if they agree to fight the demons. The Counters are not only restored to health but also are given supernatural powers and superhuman strength. Ga Mo-tak (Yoo Jun-sang) is an older male Counter who is much stronger and more forceful than the other counters. As a former detective he is also able to use his investigative skills to hunt down the murdering spirits. Do Ha-na (Kim Se-jeong) has the ability to sense when a human hosting an evil spirit enters the Counter’s territory. Choo Mae-ok (Yeom Hye-ran) is able to heal others and as an older woman is motherly and nurturing. To cover their real purpose, the counters run a noodle shop around their busy demon hunting schedule.
In the beginning of the series, there was a fourth Counter Jang Cheol-joong (Sung Ji-ru) but a super powerful Level 3 (Level one being weakest) evil spirit kills him and consumes his spirit. His Yung companion spirit, Wi-gen (Moon Sook) has to quickly find another partner spirit and winds up drawn to and pairing with a young, non comatose, teenager, So Mun (Jo Byung-gyu). This unique pairing leads Wi-gen to believe this young person, who is slightly crippled on one side, has something unique to offer. To convince the young man, the team offers to heal his crippling injury and allow him to talk to his parents who were killed in the car accident that injured him when he was only 11. Soon the team finds that they desperately need the help of this young man who proves to be the most powerful and diverse Counter of them all. As the team fights many battles together, their bound grows into that of a close knit family. They find that tragic events in their past also tie them together and compel them to risk everything to send perhaps one of the most powerful and evil spirits they have ever encountered to the afterlife.

Spoilers*. I am a huge fan of supernatural and action dramas. I like strong male and female characters a complex yet easy to follow plot and lots of character development. This series had it all. The main character was such a cute and likable young person it was easy to understand why the group would so quickly and deeply take to him. The action scenes left me wondering if the actors were doing their own stunts because they were amazing and very fluid. There was a little romance sprinkled in although that was in no way a central focus. The central character’s growing skill was fun to watch. We were immediately drawn in and hooked to the last scene. It ended well (not sad) and plot points were wrapped up. There will be a second season but do not think that means this one did not wrap up. It stood lone well yet has some elements that would nicely carry to the next season. Highly recommend this series.

A successful story in webtoon

Demon hunters pose as workers in a noodle shop in an effort to catch evil spirits hoping to find eternal life.

This drama will give you reasons to fight for yourself and your loved ones without losing your own self. As one of the factors that I love about this drama is the fact the So Mun is the youngest among the Counters, but the most powerful and ""The Ace"" of the group. Young people are more than just their age! He is also indeed one of the best character developments a Kdrama has offered. Good friends and support are important for your growth. Choose your people, wisely!

This drama will show you that all your emotions are valid, you'll just need to know how to control them properly. Each one of us has an ""evil desire"", beware of it before they control you.

This drama will make you realize that you can be your own hero. And the fact that even superheroes need to rest, and recharge.This drama is super good.

YOU WILL GET AMAZED.

FUN FACTS:

Out of 400-500 auditions of Jeo Byeong Gyu (So Mun) sa The Uncanny Counters got it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPER DUPER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

BETTER THAN YOU THINK
I watched this because of sejeong, and I usually like romance, simple, slice of life dramas. BUT THIS. This was something else. Such a fun, enjoyable drama that I can look forward to on the weekends because every single episode is exciting. Has some really heartfelt moments where I cried like a baby but also satisfying scenes when they took on the evil spirits. This is just a great drama overall that makes you feel the whole spectrum of emotions. I will say there are some plotholes and bits that don't add up 100% but overall, the main plot works fine and its not something you should nitpick or be too concerned about. Just enjoy the action! AND THE ACTING IS GOOD AS (the evil spirits were actually evil and not just cringey evil acting)

after romantic cliches uncanny counter is a splash of water on my face on a hot day
it has been a real long time since I added a drama to my top 10 list. And uncanny counter succeeded on being my 2nd favorite drama all time. Actually I had little prejudice before starting to it cuz I have never seen old main leads and the trailer was not really attractive to me but I decided to give it a try since I'm on my 16 days school break.

The first episode was actually little boring to me cuz I don't usually watch things that has fight or whatever but somehow uncanny counter actually kept me in. I watched total of 3-4 episodes that day. The more I go on the more I liked it and adored it. After those romantic cliches uncanny counter was like a splash of water on my face on a hot day. The way their chemistry growed episode by episode was amazing. I really liked how mun risked his own life to protect his friends and family. Motak's story was really sad especially when he lost his girlfriend without even talking after his memory came back. But if you ask whether I don't have any disappointments, there is. It's about hana's story. I actually thought that they would give a bigger story on her past life. Maybe I didn't get her story or it was less.

As I said above I was sick of romance dramas but here mun's and hana's chemistry was out of this world but without any of love lines. This is what I want from other dramas so that we can feel their sincerity ? and their true feelings.

Lastly for the music, it was not that bad, close your eyes and meet again really got me in. I especially listened meet again at least 30 times.

Overall this is a great drama which has the potential to make you both cry, laugh and surprise. 10/10 for me!

I loved this show so much! It has become one of my favourites. I keeps you engaged throughout the whole series and I didn't even skip one scene. I loved the combination of drama-action-comedy that brings to the table and how it all conveys so gracefully . It brought me a feeling of wholesomeness. It had some tearjerker moments, some awesome action scenes and a whole lot of comedy. I usually go for romance k-dramas but I'm glad I didn't pass on it. I wholeheartedly recommend this series and it is worth a rewatch.

SO EXCITING!!
Okay if you're reading the review to ask yourself whether you want to watch it or not, lemme tell you this: WATCH IT RIGHT NOW!!! It is hands down my favorite Korean drama. If you like action or thriller, this is the perfect drama for you. This drama also has snippets of comedy and romance, but not at all cringy. The excitement really never stops. Even when they aren't doing something, it is still interesting because the storyline is captivating. I don't want to be too dramatic, but this drama is one of those dramas that you can't skip anything because every single moment is packed with juicy plots and twists. Anyway, overall, it is a great drama. Acting and casts are amazing, and I couldn't think of anyone else that would fit the roles better.

Best find of 2020 for me
I have been hooked on this show since episode 1 and truly a gem among some solid k shows for 2020... I truly have enjoyed the story, the cast and their back stories. I watch a lot of k shows and this definitely up there for myself for 2020. If you enjoy supernatural stories that have a family feel to it, this is perfect for you. I am nearly finished what has come thru on Netflix and I don't usually write reviews but for this and shows like Train, Kairos, Stove League, Backstreet Rookie and The Tunnel I have enjoyed watching in a couple of sittings. I hope they do come back with a few seasons

First time in a while to finish a drama from start to finish!
If you're like me, it's really hard to find dramas that entice and keep me interested to watch until the end. This drama, literally from start to finish was probably one of the few in a long time to keep me on my toes each episode, and also make me go through a variety of emotions within one episode. It is really worth watching, I loved the cast and their dynamic. Each character had their own stories that were explored but flowed really well with the main plot. I ADORE the actors and actresses just as much as I loved the plot. Really consider watching it!

Amazing show!
Overall thoughts:
I was hesitant to watch it because I mostly watch romcom kdramas but this one is just *chefs kiss*. from the production quality to the acting, everything was exactly what I wanted from a drama. it's easy to watch, it's funny, quirky but it still has heartwrenching scenes that I adore. I would definitely recommend this drama!

""Bad"" parts:
one thing I would've loved to see more of is probably them catching regular evil spirits. they only catch like two regular ones at the beginning of the show then focus solely on the level three and four evil spirits. I just wished that they would write in more action scenes with the level one or two evil spirits because they were genuinely really fun to watch. but that's just one small complaint that I have.

The acting:
I loved everyone's acting but the person that played Ji Cheong Sin (main evil spirit) was just an incredible actor. his facial expressions were so well thought out, his creepy laugh was amazing and just overall he scared the shit out of me lmao.

Music:
the only reason why I would give the music a 5.0 is because it wasn't really memorable for me. it wasn't bad or anything but me whipping out my shazam app just to know what song it was at a specific part didn't happen and it would've gotten a higher rating if it did.

Cunningly exciting and also incredibly heartfelt
This series is really amazing from the story, the characters, the CGs and the execution. I can't really wait to see the next Season.

What I love the most in this series is how engaging and interesting the story. It also gave a variety of genres with a perfect balance, from comedy, drama, crime, and fantasy. It started with these main characters who is working on a noodle shop and also a devil catcher at the same time and as the story progresses, you'll get to know more about their past and personality. It also introduces new characters that makes up this big picture that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

I also love how the story is presented in an engaging way making you want for more. Unlike other series which keeps you frustrated because the climax is too far, this series gives off several impactful climax being more and more intense as the story goes on. I find myself screaming and crying with the characters because I was able to relate with the characters as I am watching them. It's also more exciting seeing the villains and main characters have a head-on fight instead of the usual crime series with 15 frustrating episodes where the villains win and then on the final episode, the villains gets defeated.

The chemistry of the Counters is really commendable as well because they really give off that 'team vibe' which makes you root for them more. The character development is also reasonable because you've got to see how the character's complexity is being shown as you move along through the series. The individual characters both for main and also villains gave different life lessons you can pick up along the way.

Before I even forget, a very good job to the CGIs, it didn't disappoint at all. It makes my heart beat whenever I see the Yung Territory. I know it's just a simple CGI but the impact to me is so great that I even get goosebumps because it's not too much but it's not lacking. Just the right amount of CGIs to keep me impressed.

If you want to watch a great an unique series that will keep you on the edge of your seats and will leave you wanting for more, you should definitely watch this!

I am so hooked with this series that I always look forward for the weekend to come.

The story was actually great but I got a little disappointed on the last two episodes. It felt rushed and as if they added unnecessary scenes. As we all now the writer got changed starting EP13. My initial speculation is that the Mayor's son is supposed to be the last evil that they'll fight for this seasons as the past episodes made it look like it. Although it also makes sense that the Mayor ended to be the one as he has done a lot of evil things even without an evil spirit inside of him.

I actually got so attached to this series that whenever I watched an episode, it feels as if I am in a different world with the counters. An hour episode is enough but two episodes isn't lol.

The actors are so great in portraying their characters but if I am to mention some, I must say that I am so proud of how much Sejeong's acting actually improved since her last series that I've watched. Lee Hong Nae is also a great actor, the way he expressed the ultimate evil was superb!

Overall, THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BEST SERIES that I have watched this 2021. I am so excited for Seasons 2 and I am just hoping that they will retain our lovely counters as the main cast.

Has a little bit of everything!
I've been watching dramas for years now, but it's been a while since I've fallen so hard and so fast for one! I don't want to overhype this drama, so take it with a grain of salt, but I definitely believe it's worth checking out so that you can judge for yourself.

I for one, absolutely ADORE the cinnamon roll that is So-Mun and the rest of the cast with their amazing acting and chemistry with each other. The story line and world-building is well though out and put together. There's elements of romance (not much but does exist), fantasy, mystery, and crime. Which I feel covers majority of the genres out there - It's why it's such a good drama! While this may not be a 10/10 for everyone like it is for me, I still believe that it deserves to be checked out so that you can decide for yourself!

If you're like me and you absolutely loved dramas like Healer, It's Okay to Not be Okay, City Hunter, or even Cheer Up then there's a good chance you'll love this drama too!

Solid but repetitive towards the end...
This drama about four demon hunters called Counters started off well with a solid set of lead characters, a good supporting cast, and even humourous motifs such as the spouting of curly hair when a person becomes a Counter. However, there's too much repetition especially in eps.13-16 such as the scenes summoning the evil spirits and evil spirits transferring in and out of various people, which could've been shortened once the viewers have got the idea. Without the padding the last four episodes could've been shortened to say two episodes.

The cast is strong and I liked how the Counters became a family and looked out for each other. The character So Moon is a bit wet and inconsistent even taking into account he's an eighteen year-old. At the beginning So Moon says he doesn't want to put his own life in danger because of his grandparents but as he gradually comes into his powers he becomes reckless, fighting the school bullies on several occasions and then hunting the Level 3 evil spirit Ji Chung Shin alone. Also, the scene where So Moon's other world partner Wi Gen takes away his power doesn't make sense. When Wi Gen's original host was killed she was in a hurry to find a new partner but later she's able to leave So Moon's body and hang around while interviewing new partner candidates. Really?!

The supporting cast of goodies and baddies is generally good although I didn't like Choi Kwang Il who played Mayor Shin. Choi was stiff and had only one expression, which was essentially the same one he had in the drama Vagabond. I liked So Moon's best friends Woong Min and Joo Yeon and would've liked to have seen more of the three of them together aside from when they are supporting and comforting So Moon.

I originally gave The Uncanny Counter an overall rating of 7 but changed it to 5 because eps13-16 was repetitive and really dragged as a result. There's also not enough to re-watch.

Turns out...humans can't fart rainbows.
The funniest part about this drama is the disclaimer at the beginning of every episode letting you know that all characters in the show are fictitious and not real. Every time I'm like....wait...so you mean humans can't actually shit rainbow sparkles to beat evil spirits?!? I mean like...so disappointed with humans right now.

This drama was really well written, it's a really solid piece with good acting, decent music, and lots of exciting fight scenes. I like that one of the counters is a granny, and one of them is some eccentric old rich dude (actually a pretty cute little old guy, I liked him a lot). There are some inconsistencies and plot holes, especially around the fight scenes. Like sometimes I don't get how Ha-Na is supposed to be super strong yet she sometimes is a badass and other times she sits a fight out like a weakling with no real explanation...like is she a badass or not? The granny sitting out I get, because she's primarily a healer after all. They actually dropped Ha-Na's storyline for several episodes too, which made no sense because they kept every single other counter's back story going in those episodes. It was also awfully convenient that they brought in a Singapore counter to die so they wouldn't have to kill off any of the main counters....poor dude.

The other thing I can't figure out is how the lead character, the high school kid, manages to pretty consistently keep one eye twice as big as the other eye with this sort of constant either shocked or hurt or hurt and shocked expression...it's basically like o.O constantly. Little dude cries at the drop of a hat too, he's definitely great at portraying an emotional teenager. I'm 90% convinced he's actually an anime character drawn into the show. The people from Yun are a little strange as well, I really liked all of them and thought they did a good job...except Wi-Gen...I dunno if I'm supposed to like her, she seems like a total dick though. Even her sort of redemption arc it doesn't seem like she's ever going to have the same chemistry with her counter that the other spirits do.

All my complaints up there are pretty minor though, the show itself manages to be really entertaining and it's a fun sort of family super hero show. The heroes are great, the villains are great, the settings are perfectly suited to the action scenes, and the rainbow sparkles are pretty. Overall I think it was really well done and I hope there's actually a 2nd season, since it's Netflix.

THE BEST ACTION DRAMA
I reaaaaaaalllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy enjoyed this drama.
First, the story. The story was so good and every week it made me sooooo excited and I would wake up early for this. I don't wanna spoil so I won't tell you the story you can read the summary in the section above the reviews so...
The acting was amazing. I was surprised by the ML and his acting. I haven't watched his previous dramas but I know this is his best drama. Every character in the drama was so good and their acting matched up very well.
The music isn't that catchy but it made me hype up and get emotional and ya...
I would DEFINITELY watch this again. Probably with my family next time.
I hope this will make you watch the drama :)

The selling of noodles and catching evil spirits.
This drama is like no other, it's like watching Ghostbusters but it has even more than Ghostbusters offers. It's basic on a webtoon which I didn't watch but you don't need to have watched the webtoon to enjoy this drama. I watched this drama because it was popular and I was just going to watch it and see if it was as good as they said it was. And am not kidding because this has become one of my favorite dramas. It's not boring when you start to watch it or even after, all you could think of is I want more. This drama shares both action, thriller, comedy and it's very emotional ( the good kind of emotions). The acting the actors and actresses showed was beyond amazing it was the real thing. For me, this drama is a rewatch and highly recommended for all of you who want some action but yet fun drama. And let's talk about how cool so moon ( Jo Byung Kyoo) looked with the Perm and the new powers Omg what a sightful. The ace of the team.

Uncanny Counter
Two episodes in and I find myself wanting more. The first week's outing had a bit of everything, action, humor, fear, a sense of justice in the face of injustice, and, of course, evilness. It might only be the first episode, but I didn't want it to end as I was having so much fun. I love the concept of this drama. A group of ordinary humans turned super-beings, each for their ability to possess or be a unique power that helps a higher beings' quest to hunt demons who come to earth wanting immortality. I must say I loved seeing Kim Se Jong; she looks great, and so do Yoo Jun Sang, Yum Hye Ran, and Jo Byung Gyu. It's good to have JBG back.

There's no denying evil exists in this world, but the light will always conquer the darkness. This drama quickly became my happy place and besides Yoo Joon Sang, Im Joo Yeon Moon's best friend is my favorite persona. I love how endearing the story is in that it's not just about capturing evil spirits, but also about righting the wrongs of ordinary people along the way. As they say, evil lurks in places where one would never imagine to charm its way into one's life and one always needs uncanny counters to help combat if not completely irradicate them (if only possible). I am in love!

Making a great drama is simple
All you need to make a hit drama is good writing, great acting, and excellent production values. It helps if the music is good or at least not annoying. This drama ticks all the boxes, so much so that a person like me who fundamentally dislikes action dramas can find this to be the best offering so far this year. I looked forward to every episode and was never disappointed.
Yes, the premise is silly, as are all the demon hunter dramas. But the characters were so engaging - even the villains - that it was impossible to avoid getting caught up into who they were, what was happening to them and what they would do next. There were several touching stories about loss and love wrapped up in it, as well as friendship and redemption. It has everything you want in a drama - and maybe more bloodshed and violence, but that goes with the territory. Literally, if you've watched it and know what the territory is! This isn't for the faint of heart, and I'd exercise parental controls over younger kids. But it was a great ride.

Rock Solid Entertaining Series!
Either I have been extremely fortunate, or there is simply a treasure trove of K-dramas that I have had the pleasure of watching that have simply been superb! Series from ""Mr. Sunshine,"" to ""Descendants of the Sun"" to ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"" to ""Crash Landing on You,"" to ""Stranger"" and on and on. I have been exposed to the very best that Korean television has had to offer, and I'm still leaving out many others.

On the surface, a viewer may look at this as a sort of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" type series where three individuals (which becomes four) run a Noodle restaurant, but on the side, they're catching demons, i.e. evil spirits. These people are called ""Counters"" as they are imbued with special, superhuman abilities from their ""sponsors"" or ""counterparts"" in Yung (a sort of staging area before moving on to ""heaven.""). To look at this series with those eyes is to short-change it dramatically.

Like nearly all great K-drama series, this series is driven by great, and even deep characterizations with a rich story that actually has something to say; how to deal with bullies, both within the school system as well as within the corporate world; those who would prey upon the weak and helpless.

Someone once said that evil tends to pervade when good people do nothing to stop it. Many consider this to be even worse than becoming ""evil.""

The story centers around Mun, a young high school boy who's suffered untold and unspeakable horrors by losing his parents in an accident and also the physical disabilities that are the result. And yet, he never hesitates to jump in and protect his friends and those who are ""weak."" Where most people would hesitate or not act at all, he doesn't even think about it. He simply acts. And while he can be impulsive and wears his emotions on his sleeve, he is essentially fearless when it comes to doing the right thing.

""The Uncanny Counter"" is a testament to the ideal belief that even the smallest person can make a difference. Yes, the Counters have special powers, but they are also only four people going up against a system. Much like Superman who always finds himself in over-his-head against Lex Luthor...someone who uses the power of the system against him.

One of the things I love about K-dramas, is that they aren't afraid to allow their characters to demonstrate natural emotions. In this way, we are given deluge of deep, realistic, and relatable characters. We are also usually given something to really think about. In this series, we are presented with the idea that a person doesn't need to have special abilities or super powers in order to do the right thing; that, indeed, one person, no matter how small, can make a difference. It also conveys the truth that no one needs to stand alone. Bullies are cowards. All of them. And they are easily dealt with when people rally together to fight them.

All of the performances in this series are fantastically done. Characters that will make you laugh, sniffle, and evoke raw emotion. I suppose there is a reason why I'm far more into K-dramas right now than American shows, which no longer seem to provide me with stories and characters that speak to me. Instead, we're given a barrage of CGI, wooden characters that have virtually no depth at all.

A binge-fest! Sejeong!
If you were with me, I'd probably be telling you how I binged this in 2 days.

Please view my bio for the standards for a 10/10 drama.

Let's dissect the story first. It had an amazing plot, but of course, it DID piss me off once or twice. The rules to being stripped of your counter powers were so vague. Also, the plot played around with the characters lives (killing them and then bringing them back to life) with no solid reasoning behind it. Finally, the last thing that pissed me off was that they centered everything around Mun wanting to say something to his dead parents.

The cast was good. So Moon, the character, lowkey pisses me off because he just *snaps* me out of the ""drama trance."" If you don't know what that is, it's a terms (that I may or may not have invented) which describes when you are so into a drama, the actors don't give a vibe that they are acting. The way he exerts his fury just *snaps* me out of it. There was an odd balance of comedic relief among the main characters though; Chu Mae Ok/Ga Mo Tak/Choi Jang Mool being the comedic relief and Do Ha-Na and So Moon being the seriousness. That made it resemble a webdrama, which is what it is. I honestly came to support Sejeong but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the drama. Most of the actors and actresses perfectly fit their role.

Since most of it is action, it would not have a high rewatch value. Lastly for music, Sejeong sung one of the OSTs. This makes me really happy as I love when the actors of the drama sing one or more of the OST tracks.

Overall, I WOULD RECCOMEND if you are more of an action fanatic. P.S. I am not a big fan of heavily action-based dramas.

SQUAD GOALS FIGHTING EVIL!!!!!
This drama is a hidden gem. Before diving into the plot, the SQUAD GOALS ARE REAL and honestly i don't even care about anything else. The interactions and bond between the counters made this drama 1000x better than it already was. Not to mention the badasss music that plays when the squad rolls up to beat the crap out of some evil spirits. ALSO TRUCK-KUN is part of the cast and my favourite character tbh

The story is nothing special however, we all love badass male characters that level up during important times and suddenly become stronger. Well that happens often in this drama.......I must say the ending wasn't as clean as it should be but they're GIVING US SEASON 2 so i ain't even complaining. This drama is wholesome and an emotional rolleroaster at the same time.

I was hooked almost immediately. Stories within a story, lacing together. Suspense, violent action, nasty bullies, vengeance, abusive childhoods, friendship, loss, trust, love, tears and laughs. It's all here.
No character is perfect, but so many are more than likeable, flaws and all. The baddies really are evil.
So Moon, Mo Tak and Ha Na probably develop the most as the series progresses. One matures, one is able to find themselves and reconnect, and another is able to face up to a guilt ridden past and open themselves up again.
Ji Chung Shin was a character I couldn't help but feel for. Vulnerable to manipulation and a harrowing past, I didn't feel at all guilty about wishing he could somehow be redeemed and freed of his demons.
I also loved the OST, with tracks from the brilliant Isaac Hong, Dvwn and Sejeong.
I will definitely watch this again and eagerly anticipate series 2. Do NOT let us down, Netflix!

Intriguing story with excellent acting!
Story
This series started out impactful with the school bullying, the introduction of the counters and the fighting of the evil spirits. All these had me hooked to the series from episode one.

The stories of the counters were all so touching to me, and I loved them so much. Though I still feel that Mo Tak did not deserve what happened to him, I guess it gave him the motivation to fight the evil people. I’m also glad that So Mun managed to see his parents after all.

The trio’s friendship and the counters’ friendships are what I envy the most. To start with the trio, his best friends have been there by his side since he was young. They supported him throughout the entire series, and still trusted him despite him not being able to tell them the truth. Even when Ung Min was in trouble, he did not want So Mun to know, because he did not want the latter to be burdened or to receive the same treatment he did. One thing I learned from So Mun in this friendship, is to have the courage to stand up for what’s right. Although he did not have the ability to fight against Hyeok U and the bullies, he still did to protect his friends. I admire him for that.

As for the counters, initially they were not confident that he could handle their job scope, but they all ended up being one big family. Towards the end, instead of crashing So Mun’s hope, they fought together with him, putting trust in his words.

To be honest, the last 3 episodes of the series doesn’t seam real to me. So Mun suddenly gained so much power, and it felt very unreal. I do understand that it is a fantasy show and fantasy isn’t reality, but the sudden change in strength just puts me off. Also, after not being able to win against the evil spirits for so many episodes, the way they won against the evil spirits in the last episode wasn’t very satisfying.

I love the concept that evil spirits could only get into the body of people with evil mindset. That just shows how scary humans really are. There are people who said that they don’t understand why the Mayor did not have any spirit possessing him even though he killed someone. I think it’s because he only killed one person, and the others were not killed directly by his hands?

Acting
The casting team did such a good job casting all the actors and actresses for this series. From the counters, to the evil spirits, everyone did such a good job. The fact that we really dislike the characters show how well they performed. I couldn’t really let go some characters, especially the one that I thought shouldn’t have left and deserve better.

Overall it was such a good watch and I’m sure I’ll miss the characters now that it’s over. Can’t wait for season 2, and I guess this might be the show I’ll rewatch again some time in the future. :) It’s one of the 2 kdramas I’ve watched in 2020 considering the fact that the other dramas’ genres are not what I like ): Hoping for more kdramas that will attract me with good plots!

I was sceptical at first to watch this because of the whole supernatural, evil spirits and whatnot. but then when u actually start to watch it it is not cringy at all and the story is smooth. the production is well done and the whole supernatural powers look believable from the angle of the story. ( this is because for me most supernatural dramas tend to look dumb and stupid and unbelievable ). I thought the last episode will end in a cliff hanger because they were planning for a season 2 but amusingly, the ending was sweet and makes me want to rewatch the drama again.

Keeps you hooked to the end!
I really didn't expect to enjoy this drama as much as I did, mostly because I happened to watch it almost by chance and I didn't see anyone talk about it. GRAVE MISTAKE! It is really, really good.

The story is super duper fantasy, so be prepared for all sort of weird things and magic, but I think it works well within the context of the story.

You will fall in love with every single character, even the villain! I must say, I especially loved the main villain (Sin). I wish we could have seen more of him and I honestly hope he'll be back for S2!

I was scared there would be an open ending because of the S2 announcement, but the drama is wrapped up nicely and doesn't leave any question unanswered, so even if it didn't continue, you would feel completely satisfied.

Simply speaking, JUST WATCH IT! You won't regret.

just woww I really understand the hype tho. fantasy, action, crime, comedy, familyhood all in one dramas. at first I was kinda umm ... but it gets more and more interesting and with that, the last episode is my fav. the crime part was a lil bit meh for me but since other parts were very fun it wasn't a big deal. the casts are all amazing, they really brings out the character with their top notch acting. I kinda feel their sadness and happiness together with them ughh lahvvv. there were lots of heartwarming scenes, so get ready some tissues. the action scenes were cool too and the cinematography is AMAZING!!! lastly, girl crush sejeong is my fav sejeong :)) watch it guys, highly recommended

Mine is most likely an unpopular opinion. I would have probably enjoyed this drama if it was released some years back. in comparison to what we have now it came off really lacking. The story was all over the place and the fight scenes which were supposed be the attracting factor were nothing special. The actors were good but due to poor character development, I found it had to muster up emotions which I should have had for some scenes. This was a Storyline which could have been a hit but just missed the mark

Amazing Rumour Amazing Drama
This is the first time for me to watch an ongoing drama. I don't like waiting but this drama is worth the wait!

The actors, plot, action scenes, even the tearful scenes are all on point. Sejeong and Bonggyu shows impeccable acting skills. The actors are somehow underrated. THEY DESERVE MORE RECOGNITION FOR THE GOD SAKE.

Hana's past revelation scene is the most tear-jerker one for me. I can't help but crying a lot.

And MY GOSH, the character development is also my favourite. HOW COME 60 MINUTES FEELS LIKE 15 MINUTES? I am not gonna lie. It DOES feel so. Please, give it a shot.

Exciting super hero series with dark political undertones
In a world where demons escape from the afterlife and cause chaos on Earth, a group of special people called ""counters"" are humanity's defenders and protectors. When I see the word ""Uncanny"" the first thing I think about is the Uncanny X-men, super heroes with special unique powers, which is exactly what the 4 lead counters are. Very early on we're exposed to what they do, why they do it and how dangerous it is. So dangerous death might result from them trying to do their duty. 3 of the 4 counters work at a gourmet noodle shop which always has long lines when it's open. Shout out to the production team, those noodles look mouth watering and I had to go get food after that. The 4th counter dies and his power transfers to our unlikely hero.

This new counter has a deformed leg from a childhood car accident that killed both his parents. His story is tragic but the hero is SUPER likeable. He's dealing with school bullying and a grandmother suffering from memory loss. It's impossible not to like or sympathize with him. As we learn more about each counter we realized they may be more connected than we thought. There's also chaebol level criminal happenings backed by politicians and dirty cops, showing high level corruption on a massive scale.

The villains are well fleshed out. There are 2 lead demons, both are easily hate-able especially the female one who seems to have a face made for bitch slapping. In some ways even with limited screen time they seem more interesting than the leads. The action is exciting which makes this an easy show to watch and recommend.

The positive. The team has a nice bond between them and it has a fun vibe. Got a few laughs out of it.

Started the series in the mood for a bit of the supernatural but this didn't quite cut it unfortunately. Reminds me of anime live actions where it tries to but fails to capture its essence. That's in my personal opinion of course, since taking an imaginary world of endless possibilities and trying to bring it into the ""real world"" is a daunting task.

I think they tried so hard to incorporate a little of everything that no one bothered to actually sit through it to consider whether any of it made sense. It's like let's just make it look cool and hope no one notices. There are times when things can and should be overlooked but if even the actions scenes felt mundane, it accentuates everything else that much more.

- A high school kid (as usual) has become the team's main hope to defeat demons and despite having a zero fighting background, he ramps up almost immediately (of course). How did the supernatural spirit survive without him all this time?
- The detective who has amnesia knew enough facts about his prior life but apparently spent the last seven years not caring to look into it? He knew he was a detective and at which station but again, never even met the female detective who signed off on his suicide case? Nope, didn't get emotional or care until he met the high school kid who reminded him of a business card he had in his pocket.
- Ignoring the corny theme of spirits choosing human grim reapers and living in a white room, the grim reapers only exorcise demons but only the ones who commit violent murders? Who takes care of other demonic predators then?
- Having been given instant superhuman strength, what was the point in dramatizing the detective doing calisthenics on the bars? It would be impressive for a normal human but completely pointless for him otherwise? And worse, it hints that the high school kid who was handicapped for years and never worked on his physique is actually the stronger one in strength?

Only being four episodes in, the reason for dropping it isn't even about the inconsistencies because it could have just been categorized as entertaining. However, the flow was just all over the place. You couldn't really tell if you should find the serious moments amusing or if it was meant to be taken seriously. Then the obvious scenes that were meant to be serious transitioned with poor timing or just didn't make sense. If they focused more on the fighting demons aspect instead of trying to incorporate multiple genres right off the bat, I might have made it through more episodes.

I went to watch this drama blindly, and I really think it had the potential to be something great, but the cliché superpower troupe really killed it for me. The main lead's leg magically healed and he magically began stronger (with some training) in one episode, so I just couldn't connect with him. I was seeing him as an underdog, and rooting for him as an underdog, but they molded him out to be a perfect hero, making his previous character that had much more depth diminish in one blow.

The storyline was fine, I'm not the biggest fan of action so those scenes were snoozers, and the mystery aspect of the show just wasn't intriguing enough for me to continue watching. I'm a bit disappointed, this was not what I was expecting from the raving reviews.

NETFLIX, GIVE US SEASON2 NOW!!!
Ok let me get this out of the way, it is obvious or at least im hoping that they intended to make this a multi-season show just like the other Netflix exclusive Kdramas - Kingdom, Love Alarm and My Frist Love, so please Netflix give them to us NOW.

Now that im done ranting, lets get to the good parts:
1. Cast and characters. I love the leads, and the other characters, and the way they are developed. There was enough mystery with each of them to keep me wanting to see more. Plus, Im not going to lie i came for NJH.
2. The story. Refreshing take on the monster-ghost- good versus evil story. Have you ever seen any other show where ghosts turns into jellies? I bet not. If you have, tell me, i want to watch it too.
3. Good special effects.

The problems:
1. They ended season 1 without properly explaning what happened in the finale. One moment they were building the story to reach the climax and then poof, its finished, just like that. What happened to that giant jelly?
2. I have to wait for Netflix to when or if they want to release the second season, do you know hard that can be?

So again, heres one begging Netflix to give us the next installment. Rewatchability is an 8 just because NJH is here. However if youre the type who likes to binge watch a series because you hate cliffhangers, i suggest to just wait a little (maybe a year or so) until we have the second season.

A unique but strange watch.
The whole storyline is quite odd, but it works so well. There is pretty much a different mystery every episode so it doesn't get boring. I honestly think I loved every character. The first episode is very strange and had me wondering if I should continue it, but I feel if you enjoy the oddness of it, you will enjoy all of the storyline.

It truly is something I haven't seen yet in a kdrama. The effects are very high quality and well done, truly amazing to see and can't imagine the work that was put in. The effects are very cutesy at some points looking like little pets or candies, and at other points quite scary fitting the ghost/horror vibe. The story is very cute and humorous with some darker tones. It has so many aspects that I enjoy in a show.

It has only 6 episodes so I found myself thinking ""there doesn't seem to be enough time to finish the story well enough"" but it wrapped up nicely. I do wish it was longer but I feel satisfied with how the story progressed. However I also feel there could be more added on eventually in a new season if they wanted.

At some points a noticed a few plot holes or points that were missing and I was left thinking ""wait what happened?"" but I eventually figured it out. I do think rewatching it will give me some clarity on parts I may have just missed. All in all didn't have many issues and kept me focused, I didn't skip every 10 seconds like I do with some dramas.

The main leads were lovely, seeing Nam Joo-hyuk in this he seemed way older than other dramas I've seen of his. He fit the teacher role surprisingly well. Jung Yu-mi was very charismatic and she fit the odd-strange school nurse so well. At some points I cringed over how odd the character behaved but it just shows how well she acted because it's exactly what was intended.

Finally to close this off, I do think it's worth watching, the story has many different elements and can make you laugh or cry. I even found myself crying and that's rare for me! The strangeness was so new and fun to see. It's a cute watch that it is truly unique and honestly a breath of fresh air that I felt I needed from dramas.

Unexpected
One way to summarize 'The School Nurse Files' would be: ""Unexpected, strange and unique.""
From the very first minutes of the series you start to wonder what you got yourself into. At the end of episode one you get stuck into this mindset of ""I need more, what was this?""
This series won't fit everyone's taste but if you get rid of all common sense and logic you will surely enjoy it.
You won't be able to understand majority of the story if you skip on this one during episodes, the episodes need to be watched in its entirety for them to make some sense and for the story to flow.
As a fan of anime and comics, I can honestly say this fits my taste and it's something I've only seen in Japanese dramas, it's ridiculous to say the least at times, but isn't that something to be enjoyed? The real world is already too bland as it is.
A gem who will be appreciated over time!

Incoming: mild fever dream
Wow. What an…experience.

Objectively, I had a few issues with the drama’s execution. Not-so-objectively, this is a perfect show to accompany a couple of spiked seltzers (ahem...only if you're of legal age, please): it’s cra-zy. Loco, I tell you.

The School Nurse Files is not your conventional television show, let alone your run-of-the-mill K-drama. It really does have a “Netflix original” vibe to it (as I would describe such a “genre”): creative and at times disturbing, but most importantly, outlandish. Each episode is a trip into peculiar jelly (warning: gross to look at) encounters, meeting eccentric characters, and the resulting chaos. Mixed together with moments of dry humor, the show can feel overwhelming at times, but is unexpectedly entertaining.

I can picture this drama as suiting those with more niche preferences, so I wouldn't recommend it on a whim. The computer graphics are done so well that the resulting creepiness can be physically off-putting. And though our main character may be a toy sword, BB gun-wielding fanatic, this show’s themes are quite serious and—on certain occasions—dark. Altogether, it’s a weird cocktail of comic tomfoolery and harsh reality that’s the first of its kind in the K-drama realm.

In terms of writing, the length of the drama turned out to be a handicap. The story was interesting enough, but the progression was slightly faster than what I prefer. With even one more episode, I think the pacing could have been smoother and the message of the show would have come across much stronger.

While I liked the characters, none of them were developed to their full potentials. In the fantasy genre, where plot tends to be overpowering by nature, it’s important to build characters as interesting human beings in order to complement such compelling stories. I don’t think that was entirely accomplished here, and that’s my main qualm with the show. The characters are supposed to be strange. Most of them are supposed to rub you the wrong way. But then what? They fall flat. Altogether, the freshness of the plot is what carries you through the show.

Admittedly, my initial interest was due to Nam Joo Hyuk. Jung Yoo Mi being on the cast list was an extra plus. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the two of them performed excellently. Jung Yoo Mi excelled in her oddballish yet emotional lead role, and Nam Joo Hyuk’s portrayal of a mellow and genuine sidekick was equally fun to watch. Oh, Nam Joo Hyuk. Never could I have expected him, of all people, to lead me...here. But here I am. In jelly-world.

Because it’s such a unique drama, there’s really no way of predicting whether you’ll enjoy it unless you try it. This is one of those rare shows where watching the first half hour is likely enough for you to make an accurate judgment about how much you’ll like the rest. So, empty your mind and jump in…just…your head needs to be totally empty to accept the amount of insanity it’s about to encounter.

What's so good about being normal?
""Unless it's something bad, it's better to be weird than ordinary""

To write a review on the School Nurse files is to imply I have somehow grasped what the School Nurse files is all about. The show's glorious acid trip weirdness defies analysis and yet feels deliberate. After all - as our male lead says as we head into the plot's explosive denouement - ""it's better to be weird than ordinary"". And the School Nurse Files definitely walks its own talk.

At a Korean highschool where the kids recite cult-like verses on happiness every morning, an emotional whale floats overhead and ducks follow the leader through the school randomly. The children *appear* happy, according to our school nurse, Ahn Eun-young (Jung Yoo-mi). But when it comes to life - and especially to adolescence - it's what's under the surface that matters more.

Since birth Eun-young has seen 'jellies', a kind of supernatural human residue that grows and forms into different shapes. Armed with a toy gun and rainbow toy sword she fights the jellies that have grown so big as to be a threat to the humans around them. In this she is aided by Hong In-pyo (a Nam Joo-hyuk who is finally living up to his potential), the grandson of the school's founder who has a disability following a motorcycle accident when he was young. In-Pyo has a powerful aura that acts as a supernatural shield and Ahn Eun-young is able to recharge by holding his hand.

But this school is no ordinary school, it was built on a pond of emotional residue that a cult hopes to harness for its own advantage.

The School Nurse Files is a crazy ride of symbolism and metaphor and I'm not sure to what extent we're supposed to take it literally. But the show is unconventional and original and flat out weird. A celebration of weird where everyone is encouraged to let their freak flag fly. The show's aesthetic leans deliberately away from kdrama gloss. The kids have acne. The adults look real. Nam Joo-hyuk's model looks and height are transformed into a gawky, clumsy awkwardness that is 1000 times sexier than the usual sanitised gloss..

The only reason it's a 9 - and the only real issue I took with it - is that it's packed into six episodes like a pocket rocket ready to explode and it really needed at least one or two extra episodes to make the whole thing feel less rushed. But in the final estimation that's not a huge problem. I'll happily take another season - hell another three seasons - if I can see Eun-young fight evil while holding her adorable boyfriend's hand.

An adventure

Beyond the absurdity and quirkiness , what shines through is the ability of the director/screenwriter to pull us in this world that they created. I had my doubts about Nam Joo Hyuk and his ability to match Yoo Mi but he is effortless here. This is probably the first drama of his where I was unable to see the model in him.
The story goes places that are unpredictable but once the central theme sets in, the social interactions are the highlight.
Dramas like this are such a breath of fresh air in a sea of cliche and I am glad that I stuck past episode 1.
Get ready for an adventure and be open minded. You will not regret it.

Feels like watching a live action version of Ghibli movie mixed with Ghost at School anime series
Absurd, weird, and tickling. Rather than seeing this drama as disturbing, I find it satisfying, LOL. I must also admit that it's so much better than what I expected when watching the trailer.

Maybe you find it confusing as they don't make the story line obvious, but well, I personally feel that's the only thing that it's lacking. Instead of expecting this to be like any other K-drama, I suggest you to expect it to feel like anime series or maybe some Ghibli movies. Yes, this drama wouldn't focus on the character relationship development, but the character point of view in life and their daily adventure. I finish it in 1 day because every episode feels so fun to watch.

And oh, feel so happy to finally see new quirky female lead character that I like. Me likey!

i can't give anything a 10/10 because that doesn't exist but also it's all arbitrary anyway.


well it is certainly unique. there's a translation of a chapter or two of the novel where it comes from (https://koreanliteraturenow.com/fiction/excerpts/chung-serang-school-nurse-ahn-eun-young) and that will give you a huge working basis of the story themes wise. it's pretty straightforward and not at all. the jellies feed off of emotion and who knows how they even got there.

there is nothing normal about anyone in this drama. or, if there is, they stand out. but even the ""normal boring ones"" aren't or have their scars. there in lies a bit of a problem; because the story is so wondrous and in its own world it doesn't answer a lot of questions or it makes you pose many to which you won't get a response. a big one is that people trust the world they are in. for the teenagers it makes sense because adults are supposed to be trusted, though they can hurt them immensely. for everyone else either they're in on it or inconsequential.

there's also questions about attachment. one story in particularly i still question what it meant but it doesn't make it any less beautiful. there are cons from a technical standpoint but i can let them go because i felt so enamored and disgusted and sad and happy. it's also so fucking funny. the dialogue has a lot of meaning and it seems like everyone is a second away from a psychotic break but that's just life.

the best thing it does, which the original story definitely reflects, is make the fantastical world a physical manifestation of its themes. there's the question on how some of them come to be and some make sense. others we ask: why are they there? and they simply are. the use of adolescence is perfect because it's a time in your life when you're becoming something but also being told what that something should be.

the world embodies conformity, the jellies and interesting reflection of all the differences and weird shit around us. the authorities, whoever they may be, wants its people to live in ""safe happiness"" which is nothing at all. or it wants to make money and suck happiness and fortune from others. it shows the world as the antagonist for these people. but they're all fucking weird. weird is both a pejorative and a positive. it deals with being an outsider, being a woman, growing up, how things can majorly affect your life. the will to live when everyone tells you you're strange or wrong. in pyo as a disabled character is incredibly important and they don't shy away from the difficulties but he's also a more physical way of letting us know that we can love people and accommodate them, be mindful, and have genuine relationships. they're up and down and fucked up but you want the best for your life and theirs. there's a lot of beauty in it along with the worst parts of life. ""what can i do but live it out, just like you couldn't avoid the crane?""

it's also super philosophical. definitely definitely (i think) pulling inspiration from his dark materials, horror like jordan peele and stanley kubrick, and the mark of a director who is really interested in the silly and bizarre and evolving psyche particularly in women. she also has a pattern of exploring sexuality and gender (within and without the binary.)

the acting from everyone is great. jung yu mi shines. she's so small, so melancholy, so grumpy. but so funny and weird and she embodies ahn eun young who wilts and perseveres. nam joo hyuk is surprising in this role because it's....natural. he has grown immensely. a big thanks to the director and the cast and crew for drawing that out but also for him for genuinely showing growth. i hope this isn't an anomaly. because acting is a craft and something you should practice and want to hone. some people can and some people can't. everyone else is also a gem. the ensemble class are fucked up and wacky but we end up loving them. they're the pinnacle of awkwardness and the worst parts of growing up. and when what the authority wants ""safe happiness"" gets ahold of them they shun all the things you're not supposed to be: different. all these young kids and/or younger actors do a great job. and the teachers, especially the key weirdos, and the few appearances by some very integral characters are fantastic.

the thing is you can't really pin it down. i feel like the review makes it seem normal in any sense of the world and it is not. it's a fever dream in a way. mostly i compare it to the confinement and release from a psych ward. the music is gorgeous, seriously gorgeous. the theme song is beautiful and strong. korea's musical roots being used for something as deep as spirits and growing up, years of collecting time and humanity, is beautiful to hear. and then there's the themes of being strange and out of this world. i also love how the sound cues didn't come where expected.

every part of the show was taken seriously but the show doesn't take ITSELF seriously which is a conundrum. but it's an absurd world! we live in it! do your best, cry, and have fun.

this leads me to the directing and editing. it was fucking magnificent. if anything else, i would rewatch it for this. i love her style already but the editor brought the vision to life in such amazing ways. there's one scene where it's a teenage recreation of a shaman practice but it was meant to show their true joy and ecstasy of being together and it was cut super well. you know when editing is good, bad, or mediocre. usually people say when you can tell it's edited that's bad (which i agree with, it takes you out) but it made me realize how good the direction and editing were. the emotional beats, the blocking, the sequences pulled me in because nothing about this world was normal but i was there. i wanted to keep these snapshots in my mind. save them forever and have them inspire me, too.

i would rewatch it...i think. im lazy but yea.

overall it's a story about placement in the world. that's inherently sociopolitical—that's something you can't escape from with art and it doesn't let itself. but it lets itself play out in a way that's nonsensical. it's construction is thought out and intense, but it also knows that life isn't meant to be lived so confined so it comforts you with the burden of life. there's a lot of talk about life, creation, surroundings and it's very philosophical in the way that it isnt at all. in my darkest times i go back to some of my favorite quotes. many of them are on suicide and life by camus. the show embodies that. it even says it. basically: death is easy, life is difficult, but it's worth being present and feeling everything.

they tell us: you're trying your best. keep doing it. there's no getting better and laughing at the top of your lungs to success. you don't need to drain other people to reach wellness. there's survival and being happy and all of that shit is mixed up. and there's no normal; what the hell is normal anyway? there's a reluctance to face yourself, keep going, and want to have a beautiful contribution in the world. why not? so what? you can be selfish and selfless and angry and crazy and kind and love and be loved.

""what can i do but face it? what do you know about me anyway? my problem isn't some story in a comic book""

""they're not that different. i'm saying you should use weapons. don't hurt yourself and have fun while you're at it. be someone who is loved by others.""

""how am i supposed to fight them alone with this?""

do you know who i am? i am school nurse ahn eun young.

A bizarre series of events with eccentric main leads (or acid trip)
Nam Joo Hyuk's character does say in the drama that ""if its not bad, its better to be weird than ordinary"" and while thats a cliche quote which contains truth, it ideally represents what the director had envisioned but lack execution for this drama. To be fair I am still not sure how to judge this drama because although this drama is not that fast paced, there are a lot of skipped explanation and the plot was bizarre, therefore this drama I felt sacrifice much needed extra explanation over wackiness. Each episode forms as a short adventure in a high school which our main leads have to solve (well, mainly the nurse with Nam Joo Hyuk kind of tagging along), with the broader mystery of the school's history and the school nurse' real responsibility slowly being revealed, and how that ties in with the random series of unfortunate events thats happen to the students.

~Strengths~
Stylistic choices with this drama fit well with the strange-ness of the plot, the cute CGI effects was really well done, with the duo fighting squishy jellies (monsters?) looked like the highest quality animation live action I've seen. The plot, from what I can guess after 6 short episodes and without reading the book its based of on, feels like a monster catching story with the monsters as a reflection of emotional problems (however not 100% sure). There are many short and spotaneous and plain WTF moments, with a bit frentic energy like the anime Noragami. I also love the nurse's BB gun and little candy store like-sword, perfect representation of a comic book hero. Although the leads act well and the connection with ""aura"" is endearing yet not fully explained, I still don't understand their relationship, and with not much explained, don't exactly understand how they will fit in the story. The music was cute and really set my expectations for a wacky but cute drama, which delivered, however, this drama had a more serious and dark undertones too which I did not expect - ""lighthearted"" situations were confusing to intepret especially because they had serious implications that was just glossed over. At some point, I thought it was going to being a horror story, but even that I'm not 100% sure if it was meant to be.

~Weaknesses~
Maybe it was a stylistic choice to leave much of the plot hanging. Like why did the students steal the cushions? Whats the connection to the symptoms and the student's issues, how does everyone just accept the nurse can see things that doesnt exist, why does this school keep running after all of that - none is explained and that left me frustrated as the plot just moves on. The structure of this drama...doesnt follow traditional ones, and its left up to you to connect the dots after each ep. Some is explained later on (last ep) but even then I'm not sure if I should continue - being confused is ok, but they didnt leave enough clues for me to anticipate season 2. The ending was also adrupt and left the mystery hanging with many questions unanswered.

TLDR: Bizarre acid trip of a drama, watched for fighting cute squishy monsters but left a bit shocked at the somewhat dark implications, feeling lost about the tone and left confused about the plot. Unsure whether I will rewatch again.

Confusing but compelling
I honestly don't know what i just watched... it was a weird mix of creepy, funny, confusing and pretty (yes, the weird little jellies are cute as hell).

I feel that the ending was super rushed and there are many things that are not explained throughout the episodes, so you just assume a lot.

I was left with the feeling that I just watched the second season of a show without watching the first one.Be it as it may, I just could not stop watching the drama!

The acting was great, the whole concept of the drama was awsome, but it's missing a lot of explanations and you'll feel like there are a lot of loose ends when you finish it.

In all it was an experience, a nice but weird one, and I would totally watch a second season.

there are 2 things; one, the director had a vision of weirdness they wanted to express so this felt like an independent film rather than a drama, and I feel like the plot lost substance trying to achieve that vision.
and two, I don't know what they teach to all korean writers but they cannot explain their plot in less than 16 eps and they need 100 side plots to distract people from the main plot, so in this it felt like they had a 16ep plan that got reduced and they just picked random events fit the drama.

I'll cut this into 2 story points too,
one is the main plot around the fl and the ml which was ok, they explained well why she used toys and they even gave her a nice solid base that didn't feel flat. she had a past and she didn't just ""start"" when the drama began, most stories do that they give us a written back story and the main character starts from point 0 when the drama starts so they are as clueless as the viewers -which might have it's charming points but it's over done.
she had friends and a life around her and I really liked her arc with the friend though again like everything else in the drama it was not used well. also she cried weirdly alot, they literally had her flop down like a 5 year old and cry ;)
on the other hand the ml felt flat, he didn't have much base and he just felt like he suddenly manifestation for the fl's story. he didn't have much characteristics, friends or a life outside the fl..

and the other part is the kids..
I feel like they were the weirdest thing, their stories were weird, their actions were weird that they felt exactly like the jellies, they were floating around with their plot moves as if they too only existed for the fl's arc



my favorite part and character was Mr. Mackenzie, not because I'm biased with yooteo, but his character added conflict, mystery and depth to the story. though I think he just disappeared, I didn't pay too much attention to the last two eps..


for acting I think both mains did a better job than their previews works, Jung Yoo Mi was less awkward than her character in live and Nam Joo Hyuk finally broke away from the teen roles they forced him on, he really felt like a nice grownup.

the music was as weird as the flavor of this drama but it was nice and I never rewatch stuff.

...what?
I mean, I gotta respect the fact that dozens of people were like “yep, this sounds crazy, but we are gonna make this show anyways.” And I think it works out! Maybe? Watching it is a weird experience. Yes, this is a show about a school nurse who fights off jellies. The thing that makes this show actually weird is how seriously it plays it. The jellies are bright colored, sometimes cute looking, occasionally truly monstruous looking. The school nurse fights off these jellies using a multicolored lightsaber and squirt guns. But this show does not have quirky, cute music, or even many jokes. The tone is more like what you’d expect from... maybe like a show about a school haunted by ghosts. Except it’s colorful jellies. Occasionally when the jellies take over a student or something the behavior of the students can be really disturbing. But then a jelly will explode into a million cute red hearts. Like wtf is happening. (There is a bit of an ick factor, btw. Pulling the jellies out of people’s skin can look gross. Another person eats the jellies and it’s hella gross.)
The main duo are great. I don’t really know how to label their relationship. Reluctant allies turned friends? They have a pretty funny dynamic but in a subtle way. They both have very different attitudes towards these events. The school nurse Ahn Eun-young is my favorite character, and is in the running to be my fave kdrama character of the year. She’s slightly unhinged, blunt, a bit cynical but still working hard to save the day. She’s a very unique character and I like her a lot.
You kinda have to turn off your brain to watch this show because trying to process the weird tone and random stuff happening is a bit much and you’re not really meant to understand it anyways. My main criticism is that they try to ram in some random plot points towards the end and they just didn’t spend enough time explaining the two different secret societies. But it didn’t really seem like it mattered anyways.
I do recommend the show as an experience but I’d have a hard time recommending it as really good.

Just strange
The story was going nowhere, pace was too slow and screenplay was just not worth the time spent watching this.

It's probably one of the worst kdramas I have ever seen. It just wasn't an interesting story.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, quite possibly one of the worst kdramas I have ever seen.

If you're thinking of watching this after seeing the trailer, please avoid. Its not half as much fun as the trailer suggests nor does it have an interesting climax. Its just bland!

An Honest Review from Long Time Jung Yumi's fan
Review of #TheSchoolNurseFiles

ㅡ The series kicked off with lively and energetic and We could see the main protagonist Ahn Eunyoung. She has different ability from other children. She is born with eyes which can see ""jellies""& allow her to see kind of living creature

On the first episodes we could see an oddball introduction with some humors and intriguing part which Ahn Eunyoung is trying to vanquish the jellies with her toy weapon ( lightsaber and bb gun). I as the audience was waiting for the story telling behind scientific reasons what's going on in every story they told on the screen and sadly we got nothing.However, there are some heartwarming and jolly moment in every episodes. Thanks to Yoo TaeO and Moon Sori as special guest.

The School Nurse Files doesn't carry enough to convince the audiences with scientific reasons. They didn't flesh out into a decent story. It's really a shame because there are some a nice ideas but ended up with cliffhangers plot. Here some parts need to be answered. Ex) In the fish market, They didn't tell us who she is. What kind of operation they did? What kind of medical treatment they do? Who did they have that ability? Is there any community among them? They didn't explain anything briefly among the people who understand even can see jellies. Beside a bizarre writing with no details explanation, the story goes in piles of different directions. The series is directed with independent mind so it looks absurd. The inconsistency in editing turned into confusing. The series is no more than just selling a concept...sadly

Apart from plenty weakness they have. this series has an excellent cinematography and CGI like in fairytale world ? and the jelly floating everywhere and blobs around the screen. It looks squishy and amusing. the sound effect and BGM also great. The preformance of all casts are good but not at their best. Jung Yumi personally I could only see her in romcom or melodrama movies/dramas, but she steals the show with a bubbly spark, funny and energetic.


OVERALL:

#TheSchoolNurseFiles is a bizzare and confusing fantasy series with unsettled packed plot. There is no scientific form or explanation to anything going on the screen. As the result, it loses some interests to continue the series. The series ain't going to wrap up with explanation. A lot of unpacked files here and there, also cliffhangers ending of each files. It has nothing to expect more than disappointing plot and editing. Though the series looks charming with weird plot and genuinely has a heartwarming performances.
I can only give ★★★ maximum and I don't think it's good enough for rewatch value. If you are ready for weird, absurd and abstract plot, this series might be your cup of tea but you might find easy to give up the series and pretend it's doesn't exist.

The School nurse files is beautifully weird
This is the weirdest Korean drama I have ever seen in my whole life. I had no clue what was happening in episode one and two, I am being so honest here I didn't even understand many parts but from episode three things get understandable and make more sense.

An Eun Young is a new nurse teacher at school. She has a special ability to see jelly-like monsters that are made from the residue of human desire and she can also eliminate these jellies. Hong In Pyo is a Chinese language teacher at the same school. He has a special energy. In order to protect the students, An Eun Young and Hong In Pyo work together to eradicate these jellies. I love Mr. Mackenzie (Yoo Teo), he appears from episode three, from then things get very interesting.

So the school was built on an ancient burial ground. There is a hole where the air flows. This place contains so many energies. The energies feed off children's laughter. As they are feeding on the energies, jelly-like monsters are created. The Grandfather who wanted to channel those energies the people were worried about Mr.Hong and safe happiness changing the world. Control the breathing hole and change the luck and you will have the power to rule the nation. That was the plan designed by Safe Happiness. To those who are strong, the place will appear normal. However, it draws in the who lack energy. That's why people keep jumping in

The CGI team did a great job in VFX. The jelly monsters looked so real and also the special effects and other graphics are excellent. It is something to be praised cause it's really good. Coming to the writing, The drama is very trippy, it's as if someone wrote this drama doing acid. It's quirk and fun. also, the music is really good. Lesbians! Lesbians are everywhere! Episode 6 is bloody the best episode in this drama. Must watch! It opens up social issues and I love it. We see a lesbian couple and we see a lot more crazy things happening in the school. My favorite episode is three and six.

Overall, The School nurse files is beautifully weird. It's very trippy and hard to understand, proceed with caution cause your in for some next level supreme existential crisis. I really loved, to

Weird, wacky, wonderful
This has the vibe of Anne Hathaway's movie Colossal which I loved. This show is polarising; you either love it or hate it. I loved it so much I watched it twice; the second time to unpack the little details and the crazy that I missed e.g. the creepy facial expressions, the bonking jellies, the knots . It's not a romcom but Jung Yu Mi and Nam Joo Hyuk make hand holding sexy! It's so cute to watch her try to fight destiny. I got covid19 vibes too, as she's a frontliner fighting an overwhelming and unknown threat. Really apt show for 2020, which has been weird all around. Hope there's a second season.

WTH did I just watch ?
What a wild ride. Absolutely quirky, strange, fun, crazy, and hopefully soon to be a cult classic. Honestly I have never seen a kdrama quite like it, I was just amazed at the whole concept. Jung Yoo Mi was awesome, she brought the character of Nurse Ahn Eun Young to life! The special effects were very cool, the story was out of this world. I have to say when I first started watching this I was like WTH did I just watch lol, which was a very good thing. This drama left it open to expand the story past this season and I hope people watch it so this amazing story can continue. Makes me want to read the books sooooooo bad but unfortunately they aren't translated into English ? Anyway, do yourself a favor and watch this, you won't regret it!

wildddddd
this was wild - I enjoyed it so much. beneath the bizarre there was a lot of unexpected depth and some really touching moments. the youngins in this cast were a delight, I look forward to their future performances. Jung Yoo Mi was amazing as always, I have yet to be disappointment by her. Nam Joo Hyuk seems to grow with each role he takes on.

I understand this may not be for everyone, but I do recommend that you give it a try. I honestly didn't even watch the trailer so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I didn't even realize Joo Hyuk was in the cast, I was just going based off of Yoo Mi but I really did love it. The music was incredible, cast was phenomenal and story was so strange and I loved every minute. the six episodes were the perfect length - would have loved to watch more but satisfied with what I got.

this is not a kdrama it's an Indie movie
This show is so EFFING WEIRD!!!! I love it so so so much. I love how it reminds me of Wes Anderson/Jordan Peele/Zombieland/The End of the F***king World. It's so weird and so whack you're just gonna be so engrossed into the weird world of fantasy and satire. If you love both indie films and kdramas, this is the PERFECT blend.

Plot-wise, there definitely was some lacking. I saw a comment like this and I really agreed with it:
""there are 2 things; one, the director had a vision of weirdness they wanted to express so this felt like an independent film rather than a drama, and I feel like the plot lost substance trying to achieve that vision.
and two, I don't know what they teach to all korean writers but they cannot explain their plot in less than 16 eps and they need 100 side plots to distract people from the main plot, so in this it felt like they had a 16ep plan that got reduced and they just picked random events fit the drama""
It felt like the impact could be more had they extended the length of the drama since we only had 6eps. They have a really interesting setup and premise, the characters are also immensely complex and unique, it would've been such a great opportunity to elaborate it as a social commentary or to use it to discuss political issues. I think some were actually covered throughout the 6 eps, but the impact could've hit harder had they explored these underlying themes a little bit more. It being only 6 ep, the viewer ends up spending most of the time wondering what's going on. A little bit of a waste, but... still enjoyable.

The cast is stellar...This has got to be NJH's most mature role that suits him the most. I actually thought he would act as a student and when I found out his character would be a teacher i was like whaaaat... but he unexpectedly pulls it off so well. NJH has an aura of maturity in him that was never really seen in his other teenage roles, and I'm so glad he chose to act in such an unconventional show despite being a Hallyu Star, it really suits him. He complements Jang Yu Mi so well!
Have always been a fan of JYM so this was just a treat. Her character was freaking hilarious and NJH offsets her craziness really well. The side cast of the students and the teachers were also so amazing, it really gives you the creeps.

the cinematography --- UGH so amazing. The music --> a blessing to my ears.

Overall, a really memorable show that you can't help but love and constantly think about. love it~

Unique but confusing
This drama is anything but conventional – we see a mix of quirky characters in a high school that suffer from a range of dilemmas from potential love interests to typical teen angst to sometimes even more dark and serious issues that help bring this otherwise bizarre drama back to reality. Personally, I don't think I've seen such serious messages conveyed in such a unique way and I think this has a lot of that has to do with the special effects that were used. They really helped add to the oddness of the drama and in a way helped add a bit of brightness to this overwise quite dark drama.

Our main lead is BB gun-wielding, jelly fighting school nurse who is eccentric and unusual most of the time, which I personally loved, but I could see her being over the top for others watching. The rest of the cast and characters also had many loveable and sometimes odd personality traits, which really helped create depth in the storyline of this drama.

But honestly, I was confused a large part of the time. With this drama being only six episodes I think there was an obvious rush to cover as many aspects of the story as possible which unfortunately left behind many plot holes. The only good thing about this drama being short was that I didn't feel that it dragged at all, but I think that was because there wasn't a chance for this drama to get a bit boring because they were already onto the next topic.

We also get some resolution at the end of this sometimes confusing drama, but it wasn't exactly how I pictured this ending. I felt that a lot of things were left unsaid, but maybe they are planning a second season in the future to cover up the holes they created?

A required taste is needed
Even though visually it was amazing with the special effects and the OST was actually quite addictive, I really couldn't buy into the story for this one. I honestly just found it really uninteresting despite the great cast. However, I do think that there is definitely a sort of audience that would enjoy TSNF, especially those who watch fantasy dramas on a regular basis. I unfortunately however am not one of those aforementioned people.

Not sure if there will be a season two but if there is I will still check it out, mainly because of the visuals, and the cast.

Good Enough
"" The School Nurse's Files "" was pretty quirky. It was like a magical realism book that you read and you don't know what's happening most of the time. But the main reason why I'm rating this with six stars out of ten is because the story felt rushed and unfinished. If this one has a second season, then the drama will probably worth seven stars for me. However, for this one, the story had potential, but it was moving too fast and a few things were actually explained, making things hard to follow and confusing.

Other than that, the CGI were really good and didn't ruin the drama at all. The performances were also spot on, something that could have destroyed it, as the plot is pretty character centered.

So, overall, six out of ten.

This is weird but cute
I watched in 2 days is just addictive, the effects, the music is just bomb.She is so funny like her expression and personality, he is kind of depress but still cute. My only complain is that I would love to see them as a couple because I think they become a couple, like she wanted a family and he wanted someone to love him and talk to him. He likes her and in the end she become closer to him. But overall is just amazing... I didn't understand if the grampa was bad so a would prefer a better explanation. And the girl who wasn't human I would love to see more of her. Maybe second season, I don't think there will be but if they make a season 2 I totally would watch.

Even my love for Nam Joohyuk could NOT save this drama
What tf did I just watch ?? At no point in this was I even once remotely interested or hooked in this drama. It was weird from the start until the end and not in the good kind of weird.

I only watched this for my man Nam Joohyuk❤ All the reviews on here were praising this show and rating it 8.5 and upwards to 10 so I thought this would be at least decent but NOPE. Let me tell you that even my love for Nam Joohyuk could NOT save this drama.

Thankfully it was only six episodes. I struggled finishing this to be completely honest. Had it been a 16 episode drama, there's probably no way in hell that I would've been able to finish it.

Anyways watch for yourself because you might enjoy it if you're into this weird kind of stuff.

I LOVE Kdramas; this isn’t one of them.
Firstly a disclaimer: if you go into watching this show expecting a regular Kdrama you’ll be disappointed.

It’s more a brilliant, strange, moody, Netflix sci-fi series that happens to be Korean.

The story follows School Nurse Ahn (Jung Yoo Mi) as she battles ‘jellies’ left behind by humans that no one else can see. She teams up with a bunch of the students as well as the Ancient Chinese teacher Mr Hong (Nan Joo Hyuk).

So even though this one is most definitely not your average Kdrama, I absolutely loooved it! It’s so ...bizarre. Like, crazy-weird.

The jellies are wild creations to watch, the pacing is odd at times and really offbeat, the soundtrack is AWESOME but really moody and dark, and the acting is strange and a little uncomfortable at times but somehow in the best way possible.

But most importantly the story and the characters are really poignant and touching. I laughed and I cried. How did it do that to me with so much strangeness in the air?! Haha.

Jung Yoo Mi is such a phenomenal actress, you can’t help but fall in love with her quirky character. And even though there isn’t a romance tag I think the romance and chemistry between her and Nan Joo Hyuk is so sweet yet strangely complex. It was kinda wonderful watching two awkward characters want to love each other but not know how to be vulnerable and open up in that way.

I also loved that at times I questioned whether what she saw was real or a coping mechanism for life but trusted her intentions completely as she was our hero and I couldn’t help but want her to always succeed.

So I’d say this definitely won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, especially if all you want from Korea is your stock standard (yet absolutely fab) romantic kdramas. But if you like complex and engaging weirdness - give this a try!

A well done acid trip...? Waiting for a season 2.
This show really throws you into a story line without much information to go off of and it is really confusing a first. Stick with it!

The idea of these 'jellies' is really unique and the main female is just a great character. The whole first season is too short and it really feels like an introduction more than anything. There's A LOT more to learn about this cinematic universe and I hope that a second season comes a delivers!

First, the story line is unique and doesn't deliver cliques, which is so welcomed after a lack of refreshing concepts. With that said, it is weird. It really seems like something someone on dr*gs would think of. I mean this in the best way though.

Second, the characters are interesting and the fun to watch. Both of the leads are good and portray there characters very well, in my opinion. Nam Joo Hyuk seems older and kind of worn down like a high school teacher, haha.

Overall, really interesting and try to give it a chance.

The cast makes it worth watching.
It's worth watching because of the cast. They do such a great job! I already like Nam Joo Hyuk's acting but, OMG, Jung Yoo Mi was shining!
Otherwise, the storyline was quite weird and hard to get into. I didn't get bored while watching any of the episodes but didn't enjoy much either.
The cinematography was 7/10 for me. The jelly creatures should've been more realistic. I felt weird whenever I see them. If they've put much more effort into the visual effects, it could've got at least 8.5/10 from me. They wasted the cast and the story with the weak visuals.

Quirky but NO Kissing Scenes - Dang it
I love the idea of bad things being cute jelly like creatures rather than scary monsters. The School Nurse Files promised to be just that. Strangely enough, The School Nurse Files also managed to make jelly like creatures be very far away from cute and instead are gross and scary so it goes to show….a little production money spent on special effects is worth it……you can turn gummy bears into monsters.

STORY:
Ahn Eun Young is a school nurse that has been able to see ghosts and jellies (manifested in weird colorful gelatinous-like creatures) all her life – especially since the death of her mother. She works at a very strange high school that appears to be overrun by these jellies and so she is never bored. She meets Hong In Pyo a Chinese teacher (teacher of Chinese not a character from China). He has an aura she is attracted too and the two pair up to fight the jellies….and a bad guy or two.

CHARACTERS:
Nurse Ahn is a very well-done character. I actually feel sorry for her throughout the show because its as if she doesn’t want to have to see ghosts and jellies, she just does and feels compelled to rid the world of the bad creatures.
Hong In Pyo appears to like Nurse Ahn (although I never saw that she reciprocated – dang it). He also wants to help her make the school a more normal place.

The two seem to collect students along the way helping them. These students then are in on the secret that they are fighting the bad things. The high school students were actually quite interesting but with only 6 episodes, not too much story on them.

MUSIC:
The music is considerably creepy which works well with the story, but I’m not interested in downloading a single song. Truthfully, the music just freaked me out…..very chilling.

REWATCH:
I am not a horror-genre loving person and the jellies were just a bit to gross for my tastes (especially the character brought in to take care of the mites) but if you like horror or really strange creatures, this could be something to watch over and over. Me….not so much.

OVERALL:
If there will be a season 2 (only 6 episodes in season 1), then I’d watch it, but only if they promised me a little heat between Nurse Ahn and Teacher Hong…..dang it. It’s a great horror k-drama, and it showed the realism of school life with just enough ick that made me grateful that I was no longer high school age. Give it a try if you like this kind of thing but don’t expect any kissing or declarations of affection….dang it.

I went '???' but it was okay
First of all, this is a very weird drama, not in a bad way. The first 2 episodes was nice, it was fun to me, also it was like watching an anime, the CG and stuff. I laughed a lot too. But the colourful fun jellies drama just went darker and darker towards the end and it was hellaaa confusing. I don't know which one is the main plot and how one scene connect to others. I feel like half of my brain understand it, but then my other half brain goes whuttt in da world is happening ??? Wouldn't say it was a great drama, but it wasn't bad too. It was so weird, confusing, quite gross too but I do like it. A unique drama I would say.

Intriguing fatasy/supernatrual
Let me first start off with telling guys this isn't my normal cup of tea. The trailer already hints at the supernatural storyline. Starting the first episode, got me thinking """"what the hell am I watching?"". However, the first episode also seemed like a movie (a manga adaption if you will). Nevertheless, it got me intrigued. I bingewatched the series, which is easy due to its 6-episodes of somewhat less than an hour. Even though short, the serie definitely had depth and some deep emotional scenes. (Secretely wish for a second season)

I have to start of with the storyline, not you're typical k-drama, but that is what made it fun and refreshing in a sense. The background music is very 'supernatural' and it fit so well, I even begun to like it. I have watched some dramas starring Nam Joo Hyuk but this was his best role so far (he was very likeable). The characters were casted well.

Overall, if you are doubting, just watch it! it just six eps, enjoy!

STRANGE, WEIRD, CONFUSING BUT INTERESTING
The OST, CONCEPT, AND CAST IS REALLY GREAT. The story is supposed to be great but the execution or the storytelling is so confusing.
You'll need to watch and read some explanation videos or article after watching this series so you can get and understand on whats happening. If you want something new and refreshing, try out this one. Rewatch is a must cuz Its really confusing but enjoyable to watch.
Its not your typical korean series and not everyone will like It. Again, we have different preferences. It's really up to our taste. But for me, I LOVE IT!!!

New but lacking
This drama has quite an interesting concept but somethings aren't explained properly. It also leaves you hanging at times.It has definitely got that anime feel to it but you some manga are not able to suck you into their world and this is what this drama did. It wasn't addictive. The main male lead's power wasn't given the importance it should have been given. The aim or goal of the organizations mentioned in the drama isn't made clear. What jellies are actually that answer is still as clear as mud. Are jellies just their greed or are they spirits or regrets?
So, ya you can give it a try but it may disappoint you a bit if you are looking for 'blow your mind' action.

Review of “The school Nurse files”
(Beware that this is just my opinion and the only way for you to truly know how you feel abt this series is to watch it for yourself)

STORYLINE:
- Tbh I was honestly intrigued in the beginning. The concept was a little out their and they never rlly explain where her powers come from or how they even started but I was intrigued none the less.
- I simply thought that this was gonna be a funny little supernatural series and I was all here for it. Where it went downhill was trying to jam in some plot out of nowhere into the last 2-3 episodes. It just made everything a jumbled mess and not enjoyable to watch.
ACTING:
- I am familiar with NJK but not so much JYM and thought that I couldn’t rlly feel attached to any of the characters. Sure they had their moments but I didn’t rlly feel a strong attachment to none of them.
MUSIC:
- For me the music was the best in episode 4. It was a very feeling-inducing episode and the music portrayed that nicely; in all the other episodes I watched it just kinda faded away.
REWATCH VALUE:
- Yeah no. I dropped the show on the second to last episode. If I couldn’t even tough it through another hour of this show I’m not gonna rewatch it again.

This is the most bizarre drama I think I have ever watched.
When you start watching, it definitely makes you wonder what in the world you're watching.
It's something different, something new, and something you'll probably keep watching until the end.
I was so confused watching this! I think that confusing aspect is what made watch every episode though. With every episode I was hoping I'd get a better understanding of what was going on, but that never really happened. There was a little eye opening moment towards the end that I appreciated and wasn't expecting.
Now that I finished the show, I am very curious as to what the writer was thinking when they came up with the story idea.
If you decide to watch The School Nurse Files just know that you're about to watch something unlike anything you've watched before!

What supernatural stories should be! A hidden gem!
This is the best surprise I had since ""It's ok not to be ok"", I think even better y many aspects... And, It doen`t make any sense there isn't a Romance tag in this one. There is more romance than in many dramas that were labelled that way (Train is one of those). This one has many amazing points:

ORIGINAL STORY
UNIQUE WORLD/LORE/AMBIENT
AMAZING EFFECTS
ACTING QUALITY OVER THE TOP EVEN WITH THE EXTRAS
RELATABLE CHARACTERS
OUTSTANDING FEMALE PROTAGONISM
HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS
REAL LIFE VALUES
SUPERNATURAL WORLD WITHOUT CLICHÉS
INTEGRATING COLECTIVES NATURALLY
UNEXPECTED PLOT TWISTS
VISUALLY INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT AND SPECTACULAR COLORS USE
CHARACTERIZATION AND COSTUMES UNUSUALLY NATURAL AND COMPLEX (PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY MAKE UP)

If you pay attention to the bad critiques and the lousy ranking you are going to miss a great piece of art, a trully hidden gem.
And, Nam joo hyuk playing a not sexualiced character for a chance and totally roking it like a boss.

JUST WATCH THE FIRST EMISODE IF IT DOESN`T EXITE YOU A BIT, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.
MANGA/ANIME LOVERS DON'T SKIP THIS ONE!!

The school nurse filed explained
The School Nurse files is weird. Like really off the wall weird, one of the strangest things I’ve seen in a while. I saw a lot of people online saying they didn’t like it because it didn’t make sense or they couldn’t understand it. Going into it I expected to see a drama that followed the regular format. There’s not necessarily a set format but there is a certain style to Kdramas and this one doesn’t fit into that box. It could be classified as absurdism, surrealism, or magic realism. Absurdism is defined as “intentionally ridiculous or bizarre behavior or character.” Examples of this can be found in Plays like Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett. As well as books, movies and shows like Catch 22, Bojack Horseman, The Big Lebowski, and Rick and Morty. Absurdism usually focuses on the human tendency to seek meaning and value in a purposeless or chaotic and irrational universe.
Surrealism is described as “the principles, ideals, or practice of producing fantastic or incongruous imagery by means of unnatural or irrational juxtapositions and combinations.” Examples of this can be found in the play Rhinoceros by Eugène Ionesco (in which a small town of people slowly start turning into rhinoceros’s) as well as movies and shows like A ClockWork Orange, Twin Peaks, Beetlejuice, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It can also be seen in the works of Salvador Dali and Frida Kahlo.
Magic realism is explained as “a genre in which realistic narrative and naturalistic technique are combined with surreal elements of dream or fantasy.” Examples of this can be found in the play References To Salvador Dali Make Me Hot” by José Rivera as well as movies and shows like Donnie Darko, Scott Pilgrim vs. The world, Birdman, and Jane The Virgin. Matthew Strecher explains it by saying ""what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe."" Magic realism is usually a separate genre from fantasy because in magic realism there’s realistic detail with magic elements included to make a point about reality. While fantasy is sort of separated from reality entirely.

At first I was unable to definitively classify The School Nurse Files under one of the 3 specific genres. After watching the first episode I could see why people were confused. It’s experimental and avant-garde in a way that usually isn’t seen in Kdramas. However after finishing the show I have come to the conclusion that it is surrealism. It’s not absurdism because none of the characters really ever seek meaning, no one asks how or why and they all sort of except their predetermined fate and the strange events that are happening at the school. The only deviation from this Baek Hye-Min, who decides she wants to live past the age of 20. However she never questions what her role is or why it has to be her. It’s not magic realism because the narrative isn’t realistic enough. Obviously there are themes of bullying and same sex love but other than that, every character just accepts the supremely weird circumstances they’re in without question or hesitation. Which isn’t realistic behavior. Not knowing what surrealism is and going into the show not knowing that’s what it’d be, is why it left a strange taste in most viewers mouth.

Some of the structures of a surrealist plot are as follows.
* Deliberate abandonment of clarity, order and rational thought.
* Confusing storylines
* Illogical plot
* Elements of fantasy
* Chaotic universe with in the world of the story

Nothing is ever explained, who the safe and happiness group is, whether they’re related or the enemy of Ilgwang sterilization group. Who they are or where they came from. Who Baek Hye-Min is and where she came from. Why ghost copies of Oh Seung-Gwon where standing around the school. Why “Lucky” and “Ruckus” have an umbilical cord attached to their necks that connect them together. Why they’re attached, and why they’d die if it didn’t become unattached. It sort of made sense that it was connected to the hair at the base of their neck, but why it’s related to their armpit hair isn’t explained, or why whatever it is likes curly hair in the first place. Why does Mackenzie have seemingly more magical power than Ahn Eun-Young. Enough to the point where he put a hex on the boys on the basketball at the wish of Lee Ji-Hyeong, who then later was shown sweating profusely in the nurses office but after that is shown to be perfectly fine, absolving him of any consequences that would’ve proceeded his wish. Why does Hong In-Pyo have such a strange aura, what does it mean and why is it important to the happy and safe group. All these examples and the many more I’m sure I forgot about fall under deliberate abandonment of clarity, confusing storylines, and illogical plot.
The examples of fantasy are much more clear, the jellies, the ghosts, the multiple occasions on which the students became possessed.
The chaotic universe within the world of the story is the obvious one.
It doesn’t make sense because it’s not supposed to. Surrealism in its truest form is meant to feel like a dream. Where nothing is explained and by the end of it you’re left feeling confused. You don’t understand it because you’re not meant to. The School Nurse files was executed perfectly within the genre of surrealism. And the only way to enjoy it is to suspend your disbelief to an almost irrational level.

I loved it, but that’s because I like surrealism. A lot of people think it’s stupid. And their opinions are also valid. It could be said that most people didn’t like The School Nurse Files because they simply don’t like surrealism.

~This is one of the oddest and weirdest dramas I’ve ever watched. I couldn’t make sense of what I watched but it felt good and interesting
~All the characters are super strange and bizarre especially the lead role played by Jung Yumi who is an oddball of a nurse wielding a lightsaber sword. Nam Joo Hyuk plays the role of a serious teacher really well too.
~The animation and effects are superb. The jellies may seem cute but creepy at the same time
~The series is based on a fantasy realm but the characters feel super real. Nothing fancy or gimmicky. Just real people, problematic acne prone students and plain jane looking teachers.
~As much as I enjoyed the experience, I do think the execution of the drama without any explanation of the plot or why certain random things were being done, was a drawback. Leaving the drama open to interpretation is fine but with a plot as weird as this, a little guide would have been nice.

This drama was just... wow! It was an enjoyable watch with an unique storyline and fast pace so I basically binge watched all the six episodes in two days in-between my school work and online lessons.
The characters were easy to like and each of them were interesting in their own way. I especially liked Hye Min and I was very surprised when she got together with the other female student Radi! It was nice that there was the lesbian relationship mentioned.
The CGI of jellies was also very nice and realistic looking.
I'm honestly hoping for a second season since this one left too many unanswered questions, especially with the stolen pillows, the geese, the floating whale, and Radi's ghost seeing mum.

I never even put this drama on my watchlist, but I wanted to watch something that I could finish in just one day, so I decided to give this a try.

The storyline was odd, it was unique, it wasn’t that great but it wasn’t bad at all. The CGI effects were superb, how they portrayed the monsters and the sparkles and all the jellies wowed me. However, there are some parts of the story that was still left unanswered until the end, like what about Mackenzie, the female teacher, Mr. Hong’s childhood friend, or Eun Young’s “stepmom”? The ending was rather fast and unclear, but it’s not bad.

The acting was great, Jung Yu Mi and Nam Joo Hyuk did a really great job and the students were also awesome! The music, was also very great for me, there are soft piano tunes of “7 Princess - Love Song” which was my favorite!

To be honest, this drama isn’t really that good for me. It took 5 whole episodes for me to get hooked on finally. I loved Episode 5, it was really heartwarming and sweet, but the ending disappointed me again. Overall, a 7/10 ⭐️

Its okay, not too interesting
This might just be me but after episode 5 I lost track of the storyline. It did not make sense to me anymore. I do love the concept but it just feels like the storyline could have been better. Where did I get lost, episode 6. It made no sense to me whatsoever, the ending was confusing and I do not know what to make of it. I'm not even kidding, I am talking about the last few minutes of the 6th episode like I was completely lost and even know I still can't wrap my head around exactly what happened and why all of a sudden everything is normal.

Overall is a good drama to watch, is only six episodes long so it does not take much time to finish. I strayed away for a bit because I started watching something else but that's beside the point.

The actors were great, I loved the chemistry between the teacher and the nurse although it did not lead to anything (cries) but that's okay, I can't get everything I ask for.

If you are looking for something short to watch this is definitely worth it

Something spooky and funny for Halloween
I'm not surprised of the medium-low rating because this drama is not for everyone. It's odd, a little twisted and leaves many things unsaid until the end. It's a drama that asks you to think and use your brain, to come up with explanations by connecting the dots instead of just giving you all the answers from the start.

That's not to say the story doesn't give answerS. In the end, more or less everything is explained. The story starts in the middle and lets you get accustomed to all the weirdness and the characters before it starts to give you explanations.

Overall, it's a fun, endearing and sometimes tearinducing watch. I enjoyed it very much even though it's a genre on its own that it's even hard to explain with words. Definitely a pleasant watch I would recommend to everyone who's looking for something spooky but not scary, and to everyone who wants to have a good laugh.

//SPOILERS AHEAD//

I gave 8.5 because the ending could probably benefit of a couple more minutes to see where the other characters, especially the professor, ended up. They also teased romance for the whole duration of the series, but it seems that in the end either they leave the ending to your imagination, or it was put aside completely (I'm more for the first option, since there is /that/ scene towards the very end between the two leads, so I can't believe they just didn't pursue a relationship after that.)

For a different taste... lot of things unexplained...
Ok. first time writing a review , so forgive me if I write something wrong or hurtful...

This series does not give you much explanations at all. Lots of things happen, Things escalate rather quickly, but then the characters don't quite react to what's happening or what just happened in the appropriate manner. I don't know if it was intentional from the creators of this show, trying to be cheeky with the humor maybe.. Most of the characters are strange in this series. Strangest of them all , Ahn Eun Young, who is played well by Jung Yu Mi. I think the casting was perfect, and so was her wardrobe, and styling, and props. Nam Joo Hyuk played the role of Mr. Hong well, but it seemed weird, that both the leads would just become friends, after the strange happenings in episode 1. He just accepts without any questions that Miss. Ahn could see jellies and that they actually exist. There is no exposition scene where Miss. Ahn reveals her secret to Mr. Hong, we are asked to assume that it happened and Mr. Hong is completely OK with it, and actually plays along with tying the armpit hairs of two students... ? i cant explain that ... that's how weird this drama is...lol.... Suddenly the nurse and a student are freinds, and strangely that student is at her office almost all the time ! The Mite eater character was intriguing , but it wasn't explained , nor does it seem logical, how the character comes to be a school student in the first place. The story leaves a lot of loose plot threads never explaining it, (what's the deal with acupuncture lady ) , Mr. Mackenzie plot thread could have lead somewhere but he disappears towards the end episodes. At the end there is a major calamity, and it would have been interesting to see how it was resolved, but nothing is shown.
Most will find this weird, some people will like it, others won't. Personally, I was left wanting for more explanations and felt rather unsatisfied with the ending after investing time in watching this series (even though it's not long). I liked the characters, the setting; I liked the music, it is really unique and adds to the quirkiness of the show. The effects are also really great and also gross at some times. The creatures were well designed, some were very cute. All in all, an Okay show to pass time...

I loved it
The best way to describe it is like Natsume Yuuchinjou; in all except characters and general plot line. The Premise, themes, and mood are really similar.


I'm surprised by the number of people who didn't like the story. A lot of it is very subtle and you have to guess what happened off screen — not like in a crime shows but like really episodic. It was really crackish in terms of tone, but it was the type of humor where the the show is laughing and finding everything ridiculous to hide how dark and depressing the actual storylines are. This is not a fully shown plot with a tied up ending; I still have plenty of questions and want to know more, but I actually enjoy that. It ends very open ended, but not without gratification. This is a slowburn, pre-relationship too, so expect no kisses or real declarations of love from the mains. People are right in saying it doesn't require brain power in terms of plot but in terms of emotions, omg.

I'm writing this right after seeing it so, I will edit as I reflect more.

It won't let me recommend a non-drama so here!
Natsume Yuuchinjou is an anime, and it doesn't have any hit of romance (just a boy bonding with a demonic cat kinda?) but the tone and topics are really similar!
• MC struggling with seeing spirits and ""fighting"" them off - less fighting in Natsume
• Depressed that they can't fit in (Natsume evolves happier tho)
• Bigger orgs trying to control things in the background
• Building a group of friends over time
• Dealing with loss, and other complex emotions for yourself and for spirits and people
• Tho the scenery in Natsume that is much more like nature and forrests while this has jellies and neon swords haha
people who didn't know how to process school nurse files might like natsume more

SPOILERS without specifics because for some people will want this warning
TW:
Magically forced mass attempted suicide; minor magically forced homophobia to a lesbian couple (tho what was said made me gasp)

Jelly! Jelly! Jelly! Jelly!
This drama is peculiar. Very.
I had trouble understanding what the nurse Ahn sees are ghosts, or phantoms, or a different life form. In the beginning, I was tricked into thinking maybe it's just all an imagination of nurse Ahn. That she is suffering from 8 th grade syndrome. But it's not.

As I said the story is peculiar. But still fascinating! It is novel; something you won't see quite often.
The whole story revolves around the school, which was built over an infamously mysterious pound. There are jellies, there are people who can see them. Some people who protect other people from the malevolent jellies and some who use those jellies for their own selfish purposes. The main male lead has an unusual power which can recharge the powers of those who can see jellies.

After completing the drama, there were a lot of things left unanswered. There is still a list of mystery surrounding the school, the people who are trying to control the school's power. The male leads power. Etc.

So go ahead and watch the drama. It is a fun watch, of course. The acting is nicely performed. Unusual story, eerie setting, uncanny magic, and peculiar characters will surely make it a worth watch.
It is only 6 episodes. Plus there might be a second season coming.

Jelly out.

Strange and intriguing.
Nurse Files is a drama that invites you in a world of fantasy that challenges the norms. Our lead is a young woman who sees things called “jellies” — left behind by people, or just creatures which are invisible to most. Along with her we have a Chinese teacher who’s ability is being a forcefield visible to only few and a disability visible to all. I would suggest you going into this drama with no expectations of wanting to understand the powers of our FL, or even the issues that are centric to the plot. In accordance to the FL’s life, we as viewers are expected to simply accept whatever comes our way. Strange creatures in the school built over a what was a pond with great aura? Okay. Connection between students causing them to start behaving hysterically? Okay. Mite infestation which cause a person to be born simply to eat the mites away? Okay. There are plenty such things that confuse you, but like the leads, we simply accept it and try to fix it.

Apart from the strangeness and fantastical elements, I simply loved the portrayal of characters. Loved the relationship between the FL and ML — starts of awkward and then just becomes comforting. The take away from this drama would be it’s okay to be weird as long as you are not a bad human.

Quirky, Eerie, Weird in a Good Way, Unique, Has Depth and is Fun to Watch
Seriously one of the most different and weird Kdrama I have ever watched. The way the Kdrama is shot and presented reminds me of Animes. The characters are interesting, the story is a little confusing at first but by Ep 3 you will get it.
Ep 3 onwards it was a binge watch material for me and I wish there was a 2nd season to it.
I highly recommend this drama if you want a change of pace from the usual tropes of Kdramas and you will have ton of fun watching and surprisingly there are also many moments which were about Feels especially Ep 5(Best Ep)
Wish this Kdrama was longer or at least will have a season 2.
Also the Theme song is so catchy!

This is a personal opinion, please do not consider it as hate!
When I saw 'The School Nurse Files' is only 6 episodes long, has Nam Joo Hyuk in it and is a fantasy drama, I was immediately drawn to it. Having now watched it, I can say it did not at all meet my expectations.

Firstly, there was not a clear storyline. Yes, it was obvious that the basement and its inhabitants (the jellies) would be of importance to the plot, but until the end we had no idea why the school was built over it nor why there were so many of the jellies there. While we are on the topic, the concept of these so called jellies is quite interesting and new, although I cannot say it was portrayed in the best way. There was not much explanation, we barely got to see the main character 'fight' them and we do not know how exactly they are of harm to people.

Secondly, it felt like everything was way too rushed. Everyone thought of the main character as a weirdo, someone not to go near, then suddenly students were helping her and believed what she was saying about creatures they could not even see.

Thirdly, they should have given some of the characters bigger roles so that there are actual conflicts and problems to solve. The English teacher, Mr. Mackenzie, was introduced as the main 'rival' of the school nurse - someone who can see the jellies but does not eliminate them. Instead, he collects them and sells them for money. I was waiting to see more of him after his argument with the nurse and her going to his place, but there was no development. The same went with the Chinese characters teacher's old classmate. We saw her visiting him once and after that we only got one hint of her still being around (lipstick on a cup of coffee). So why was a character like that even needed when she brought nothing to the story?

And lastly, the main character seemed to have lost her powers in the last episode. It was a very confusing moment - it was not shown nor explained how and when that happened. The ending was also a big mess. The two main characters destroyed the school in order to show how it is not built in a location suitable enough for it, yet in the final scenes we could see the nurse sitting comfortably in her old office.

As a whole, there were a lot of things that I did not like in the drama. Maybe (this is just a speculation) if they had made it at least 10 episodes with a more define plot, it would not have felt so rushed and would have made quite a good series.

Short, strange, interesting, but left a lot of questions
I just want to start off. Acting by the ML and FL were great! Always a fan of ML. It was a nice interesting short series. Because of how short it was, I felt it left a lot of details and questions unanswered. I am still 100% confused by the ending and have no idea what happened.
Some questions I had:
Why did the mark appear? Why did it go away? What're the two groups?? How are there other people that can see jellies? Why can Mckenzie manipulate it and she didn't even try? Why did in Pyo automatically bond with her and followed along with her plans so fast? And the kids too? And what's the meaning on the ducks?? I understand that it's a short series and they can't be too detailed but it did feel too rushed on some of those details. There needs to be more episodes. Also why did they focus so much on an ex who died and came back just to die again?? Someone else reminded me of this but there are doctors capable of doing surgery on magical mite eating beings???? But then what was the role of the old fishmonger lady???? I do appreciate the lesbian couple and how ML defeded homosexuality.

A Fascinating Premise with Something Crucial Missing
I had very high hopes for this drama as a show that could be quirky and strange in an interesting and unique way. In truth, I guess it did follow through on those fronts, but still I couldn't find myself enjoying the vast majority of it. It didn't dawn on me until the end of the story, when every mystery was revealed (or at least supposed to be revealed), that I discovered what was missing. Execution. An incredible premise with an honestly very good story was completely ruined by flat acting, unclear information, and a basic lack of chemistry between the characters. It was a confusing and in the end, very disappointing experience.

The vibe of this show is not at all what I expected, or what I hoped, for it to be. A cover poster and trailer filled with outlandish colorful creatures and a school nurse wielding a light up plastic sword gave me the impression of an off-the wall, lighthearted, and occasionally funny tone, but what we got instead was an unexpectedly dark feel only made worse by bad acting. Although I don't despise a show with a darker tone, it's hard to take it seriously with all the aforementioned oddities. What's most confusing is when a plot point seems entirely meant to be played off as a joke or over emphasized in it's own absurdity, but then is portrayed as another normal development by our perpetually depressed characters.

The chemistry, in my opinion, is one of the most egregious failings off the show. There is none. And I mean NONE. It's romance without the love. Friendship without the friendliness. Banter without the jokes. Our two main leads are- as revealed by dialogue- supposedly falling in love, but you'd never guess that without them telling you. They never seem happy to be together (I think I saw the female lead smile a total of three times in the whole six hour runtime), the female lead is perpetually pushing away the male lead, and there is no sexual tension whatsoever. From a big picture plot standpoint, I can see all the elements which would lead to a romance (with maybe a few missing, but still doable), and yet the love just isn't there. And this doesn't just go for the romance, as bonds between friends is known only by who isn't outright bullying each other. Acts of kindness happen seemingly out of nowhere when you suspect there should've been something leading there. It's payoff without the setup, and frankly, the setup would've been the most interesting part.

Oh boy, was the story confusing. I felt like I had to run my brain on full power to try and puzzle out what the heck was going on. I'm pretty sure there was a twist at the end but I can't for the life of me figure out what it was. It's always unclear who knows/believes the female lead can see jellies (they're basically ghost creatures no one else can see, and I love the name and design of them). Relationships between characters is often unknown, and this isn't helped by the complete lack of chemistry between them. I really can't explain too much else for fear of spoilers, but if you end up watching this just... good luck.

I'll mention real quick that I liked episode five. It was the first time I really understood the lead's emotions (and was able to tell she had them), and it dealt with some really powerful topics and what to do about them. You could almost watch that episode alone, but it isn't really it's own self-contained story so some things won't make sense or will feel unfinished. In the scope of an ideal production of the show, I imagine episode five to be the one where our typically upbeat and wacky main character is shown dealing with tougher issues and making difficult choices. Instead she just finds a better reason to be depressed.

This drama is like if someone made a really great mold for some metal sculpture or something and then poured sad, lame, lumpy metal into it. It looks great from afar and on the outside, but get a little closer or take a look within and you'll find a sloppy mishmash that isn't quite cohesive enough to be considered good. I'm actually really disappointed with how it turned out, especially with how much potential the premise had. I'm going to have to recommend against watching this, as it's probably not what you were expecting or looking for.

I watched this twice .... and I regret it
I regret it because the first watch I was like ""WOW, this show is so unique, I love it!"" and my impression on the second watch was so different ....

I still liked the uniqueness of the drama but since I was aware of that the first time already, it's like I could only see the flaws this time around ... Biggest flaw being: the dialogues.
There are so many dialogues where they just talk in circles and it just leads nowhere! I swear, there is a dialogue where they go like ""you're weird"", ""you're weirder"" and it goes for a few seconds and it was the longest seconds of my life.

The story was weird, but it's the point of the drama.
The acting was really good, but nothing extraordinary either.
The music ... was so repetitive it got me annoyed (the main OST especially, it's in my head right now even though I watched the drama months ago)
Re-Watch ? Well definitely not since I already watched twice and it was so much worse the second time, if I watch it thrice I'll go insane

Underdeveloped Concept
This show could've used some thought put into fleshing out the characters and plot. As it was, it seemed the only focus was the CGI, which was ok.

Eun Young is a modern day shaman dealing with jelly creature embodiment of energies and spirits rather than the ghoulish, ghostly spirits we are used to with the otherworld. Her weaponries are a mixture of the old talismans and herbs and the new lightsabers and pellet guns. She meets a helper char, In Pyo, who is pivotal to the situation she's found herself in and is able to recharge her energies in her otherworldly line of work. The series mentions other kinds of non-human beings who help or hamper her work and alludes to an old power struggle between two organisations for a potent power source the school is built on. The setup is tight and neat and only needs fleshing out to develop into its own however, the fleshing out falls short of considered effort. The rules Eun Young's world lives by isn't explained as much to the viewer as it is just told. There are no avenues to ""power up"" or ""knowledge up"" besides her rudimentary knowledge so that when she meets MacKenzie, a threat, you get the sense that she is fighting way above her weight class and she is way out of her league. This is unsettling because she's the protagonist we rely on to navigate through and understand this world. We're left with too many questions that distract from being able to be immersed in this world so it creates a barrier for emotional investment.

The characters too so not help as Eun Young is too odd and rude to empathise with. She is abrupt to In Pyo even though she needs him and treats him at arm's length but claims they're in a relationship. Her behaviours are too unreliable with a guy who's just trying to help out and is genuinely interested in her world and her life. I especially disliked it when she orders him not to touch anyone else but her when she hears about Ga Young in his life. If the gender were reversed and she's the guy ordering him, a girl, this it would be considered controlling. Because she was an unlikeable character and takes up so much of screentime it made it hard to invest in this show, especially given the lack of worldbuilding explanation, as mentioned above. I pretty much just watched for In Pyo's brief appearances here and there but didn't invest in wanting a positive outcome either way, mostly because it's hard to tell what'd be considered a positive outcome.

The music and incoherent ways in which ppl behave and interact with each other kinda positioned this show as a western arthouse film wannabe. Those kinds of shows are annoyingly pretentious to watch and this show was that too. If they'd focus on developing either the storyline or characters, or both, School Nurse Files would've been memorable. As it is, it's worth a look when you have some time to kill for weirdness, since it's just a short 6 episodes, but not something that'll leave a mark on your psyche as some other thoughtful mystical-like productions might.

Confusing
I started watching this drama because I really enjoyed the trailer.

The acting, and editing were all done very well . The lead actor nailed it.
The CGI is wonderful : the jellies looked so real and also the special effects and other graphics are excellent.

At first the weirdness of the sceanrio did attract me. I tought it was something out of the ordinary. But at some point i didn't get the quirky show that i was looking for. In stead, it felt like i was watching some an independent movie which lost its plot half way. In fact somethings aren't explained properly. There were so many loose ends and so many dropped plots .
I won't be watching the second but maybe the book can give me closure.

Weirdly Charming
This the strangest kdrama I've watched and I loved every bit of it.The show might be the closest thing to a fever dream and it is understandable why this would not be everyone's cup of tea.

I was hesitant to get into it too but decided to give it a go since it was only 6 episodes and the cast looked really good but I'm glad I did it.I don't usually like watching series that are ongoing with multiple seasons because waiting for the next moepisodes/seasons seemed like a pain,and that is the only part that the I didn't really like about this mostly because even the finale doesn't really give much of a closure or explanation. Hopefully the next seasons cover all that.

In kdramaland full of cliches I would say this show is a breath of fresh air.

It's is visually stunning and the ost is particularly good,maybe even the best part.

A SIX HOUR FEVER DREAM
*shuts my laptop, stares up at the ceiling, takes a deep breath* Now, what did I just watch?

This is probably a common question among those who have watched The School Nurse Files. What did I just watch? Or, what the hell just happened? And, what's up with the ducks? Quite frankly, I can't answer any of these, but I really do applaud The School Nurse Files for breaking away from the mold and raising these questions in the first place. (Also, about the ducks: I think it might be because the school was built over where a pond used to be, but that's just a guess.)

Needless to say, this is not the kind of drama you should watch if you like your shows to serve you information on a silver platter. You are going to be confused - it is inevitable. You are going to be forced to use your brain and draw your own conclusions about what is happening. You are going to have to throw your sense of logic out the window. There were so many things that simply made zero sense, and I loved every minute of it. Well, sort of.

The show seems to stem from the genre of magical girl shows that I grew up on and still enjoy watching today - shows like Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, and Miraculous Ladybug. Obviously, this one focuses more on an adult as the 'magical girl' figure, but the general idea seems to remain the same, and I also kind of liked how it tackled the idea of an adult growing tired of the responsibility that comes along with their magical power. There is also a darker side to The School Nurse Files, and there were some scenes where I was genuinely creeped out, though I think this helped to add to the mystery of the show.

I also really liked the two main leads, played by Jung Yu Mi and Nam Joo Hyuk, respectively. They did such an amazing job portraying these two weirdos, and that's essentially what Ahn Eun Young and Hong In Pyo are: weirdos, oddballs, outcasts. They are awkward and messy, but also incredibly caring and kind. I loved their dynamic so much, and if there is a season two I hope we get to see more of them because I'd really like to see their relationship develop some more.

I also highly enjoyed watching the supporting characters, which were mostly high school students. They really helped to add to the absurdity of the show. Anyone watching this might think, man, these high school students are really weird, but as someone who has gone through high school, I can firmly say that The School Nurse Files' portrayal of high school students s pretty dang accurate. High school students ARE weird. I think we're oftentimes too used to seeing polished and put-together adults playing high school students in dramas, so I thought this aspect of the show was really refreshing to see.

The soundtrack was also spectacular. I really wish Netflix would put it on Spotify so I can listen to it as I walk across campus on my way to class.

My only real issue with the show was pacing, which I think also had an impact on why I was so confused at some parts. I think if this show had been given the usual 16 episodes, or even 12 or 10, this might have corrected this issue. Six episodes were just not enough time to establish characters and world-building, unfortunately.

I understand that this won't be to everyone's taste. Personally, I really like reading fantasy, sci-fi, and speculative fiction, so this show had a lot of things going for it that I personally enjoyed. If you're willing to embrace the weirdness and are in the mood for a short-but-filling drama, then I would definitely give The School Nurse Files a chance.

Quirky short 6 episode drama
Likes: Original story with quirky characters. The weirdness was refreshing. The acting was on point from the entire cast.

Dislikes: It may be a little ""too"" out there. I honestly don't really know what to make of this.

Strange, weird, quirky - definitely words that will come to mind when you watch this. I can't tell you how many times I'm like ""What the....""? And yet I couldn't stop watching. The tone, acting, and editing were all done very well and in a way that captures your interest. I never had to skip anything. It was a nice break from the formulaic romcoms I usually watch.

Jung Yumi is fantastically weird as the high school nurse who can see monsters in the form of jellies and uses her trusty toy sword to go about protecting the students from harm. She really nailed this role. I've seen her previous works and I personally think she is one of the top actresses of Korea. I always believe whatever role she takes on.

Nam Joo Hyuk plays her counterpart, the crippled teacher with a special force field protecting him from the jellies. He also did a really great job acting because I only saw his character and not the celebrity NJH. He keeps getting better with more experience.

The students also did a great job acting. Why only 7 stars then? While the execution was done well, I couldn't help feeling like there was something missing....like maybe a point? I felt like there were too many questions left unanswered which I think is why so many people are like ""what did i just watch?""

This was wonderfully weird and eccentric. If this was ever adapted into a US series, I think David Lynch would be perfect for this. That's the kind of strange this was. I can't fully explain what these Jellies were, what was happening and who the characters truly are and yet I was enthralled. Perhaps some of the episodes were better than others but this was a well rounded series overall. Each episode showed up some new interesting character and side-story with the one connective tissue being Nurse Ahn Eun Young. Jung Yu Mi was excellent as this school nurse who sees ghosts and other creatures. Her eerie smile and quirky style was instantly endearing was allowed for a living embodiment of what the show is about. Her and Nam Joo Hyuk, who plays the straight forward Hong In Pyo, were great leads to take us through the six episodes. The side characters and little plots were fun as well. I can't speak more love for this show. Watch it.

PLEASE JUST WATCH IT
This drama is so eccentric but that is what makes it good. Everything that happens makes perfect sense in this universe. Story is strong but I feel lik they should've given us more info about the jellies. I hope they do that in S2. All the cast members are so strong - no weak link.
Nam Joo Hyuk is so good here! This is my favourite drama of his. He portrays a serious role so well. Hopefully he continues to take on more challenging rolesp.
Jung Yu-mi as the school nurse has nailed down her weird character!

you should watch this show.
i freaking loved it so much. i love it. but you have to be in a mood to watch it. i feel like the whole show is a huge personification of being born in world, so pure and oblivious, that has so much history. in this story we have characters that feel that history and emotion in a tactile manner. how do each of them go about dealing with the mess only they can see? there's so much to unpack with each character. i wish they make a second season. but really nothing could've prepared me for the ride this show took me on. insane show, i loved every second of it.

Excellent and weird in the best way
What a surprise. I watched it on Netflix and couldn't get enough. I have a thing for fantasy, monsters, and supernatural dramas but this one exceeded my expectations. Nam Joo Hyuk played such a different character from what I used to see from him but the role fits him perfectly. Jeong Yu-mi also fitted the concept perfectly. I really hope there will be a second season.
The story was kinda wild and left you a little hung up at the end but the vibe of the show was really great. I recommend it if you want to watch something different

Disappointing .... But still good.
-Only my opinion!
-Spoiler quite possible!




I’m damn unsure if i should like this show or not...
It had so much potential! The thing is why i didn’t like that show is the feeling the show brings with it self.

I didn’t liked the style of this show. It was toooo strange, and i still don’t get it what the show wanted us to tell.

I’m disappointed because i thought it would be like all these others kdramas... because i like them in their way. But this had such an creepy different style. I’m not a big fan of something like this if I’m in the mood i watch this kind of genre but i didn’t saw this coming, that’s why I’m disappointed.

BUT! I don’t wanna say that it wasn’t good! It was totally good! Outstanding and something different! The quality of the whole show is on top! i recommend it to all who likes extraordinary, bizarre stories!

I’m just not a fan of the style/mood/feeling of this show. :)
Still! Everyone did a great job and created such a creative show!

what was that
kind of a waste of time, like they showed so many random stuff that didn't have to be there. I didn't like it but the acting was good. I could see that the main actor really matured. I'm pretty sure Netflix is gonna give us a second season soon, until then I don't recommend people to watch the first season, it feels incomplete. I don't know if i'll watch the 2nd season tho. The drama had so much potential,they needed a stronger story.But I'm pretty sure artistic or goth people would like it.It's not a long drama watch it on your own risk.

Well, it’s one kooky drama, that’s for sure. I loved the CGI - most of the jellies were really precious - the cinematography and the music, too. I liked the idea of it and the actors. And when it was good then it was truly marvelous, mainly when the story focused on the leads. But...

But. When the storytelling shifted to the students, it became very very boring and I literally almost fell asleep watching it. There were so many loose ends and so many dropped plots and the whole drama ended with a pitiful whimper instead of a bang.

Also, when Eun Young broke her promise to In Pyo... She has always been an oddball but in that moment, I actually hoped the school would fall on her head and squash her. After her big speech, when she warned the baddies off In Pyo, in the end it was she who hurt him the most. Yeah. No.

I wonder if there will be S2, especially considering the whole “Hong In Pyo... Hong In Pyo...” at the end. If there is S2, then I will watch it - but for Hong In Pyo, Eun Young can choke on her jellies!

An aesthetically pleasing, original fantasy drama
When I saw that IU would be cast in this drama, I felt that I had to give it a shot, and I'm glad to say that for the most part, it did not disappoint. Without a doubt, Hotel Del Luna is my favourite kdrama of 2019. There is plenty to love about this drama, ranging from its stunning cinematography, decent storyline, excellent cast, oh and how could I forget: the most beautiful OST in kdramaland.

Plot/Storyline:
I thought that the writing was pretty solid throughout the drama. It is refreshing to watch a drama that ventures into foreign territory and breaks free of the traditional kdrama tropes and cliches to explore the less commonly visited genres of horror (though I wouldn't really consider this drama to be scary at all) and fantasy + romance. The plot is layered and has some depth, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge. The main character Man Weol's story captivates you right from the get-go, as the show uses flashbacks very well to reveal small snippets of her past at a time, causing you to be curious about her past, and eager to find out more. The generous use of humour also helps to balance out some of the heavier, more emotional scenes, while also allowing the drama to be easy and fun to watch throughout its lengthy episodes. Personally, the ending did not play out exactly how I had hoped it would, but it was fitting to the themes of this drama and very beautiful to watch, as well as very emotional. The drama explores the themes/ideas of 'letting go', 'resentment', 'unselfish love' and 'forgiveness', which are all very meaningful, thought-provoking ideas, not just in the context of this drama, but these themes also have a place in our lives as well.

Elaboration on themes for those that are curious:
For example, the drama shows that it takes a greater act of love to let go than to hang on, which the same can be said about many situations in life. Suppose this: a severely ill person is given a few months to live. His family can choose to convince him to receive the surgery that would extend his lifespan by a significant amount, but which would also drastically reduce his quality of life (place him in a vegetative state), or let him die naturally of his illness. One may argue here that the greater act of love is to let go and allow the man to live out the rest of his days to the fullest, eventually dying a dignified death, rather than trying to desperately hang on and cause the dying man even more pain. Don't quote me on this sketchy analogy, but this is my best effort at trying to explain the themes that the writers explore in this drama.

Cinematography:
the cinematography of this drama is frankly top-notch, and can be compared to the likes of dramas such as Goblin. It is that good. The elements of fantasy were conveyed by great camerawork, skillful use of special effects, and excellent editing. The drama truly bought the supernatural fantasy world of ghosts to life, creating a vivid and charismatic viewing experience. It is difficult to describe in words, but once you see it for yourself I'm sure you'd agree that it is spectacular. The production team also did a phenomenal job of picking out Man Weol's outfits. IU looked absolutely incredible in pretty much all of her scenes, and I've lost count of the number of unique, beautiful outfits that she wore throughout the drama.

Acting:
the cast for this drama is a highlight for me. After watching IU's brilliant performance in 'My Mister', she was one of the main reasons I came across this drama in the first place. The drama is largely centred around her character Man Weol, and she absolutely nails her performance. She plays her character like it is second nature to her, effortlessly conveying emotions through her facial expressions, while also managing to bring out the complexity of her character. Her character is the focus of the drama, and IU does an excellent job in portraying her character's growth arc in the drama, all while making it seem very believable and authentic. And as a bonus, she looks absolutely gorgeous flaunting her giant wardrobe of high-end clothing. Furthermore, this drama exposed me to Yeo Jin Goo, who also delivers a very commendable effort and holds his own against IU. He appears to be much more mature than his age (considering he is only 22 years old), and the scenes of him breaking down emotionally feel raw and sincere. The chemistry between IU and Jin Goo both on and off the screen is also evident, and the relationship they develop seems to be very natural and genuine. The supporting cast also complements our two leads well, providing some comedic relief and some interesting side-story.

Soundtrack:
Although the soundtrack is supposed to complement a drama, Hotel Del Luna's soundtrack is far from ordinary and deserves a shoutout. Not only does the OST include big-name artists including the likes of Taeyeon, Punch and Heize, the tracks also have excellent synergy with the drama. The OST helps to effortlessly set the mood of multiple scenes and makes the emotional scenes even more powerful. There are many excellent tracks in the OST, but the standout for me is the special, unreleased OST by IU that is used at the end of one of the episodes. This track only plays once throughout the drama, but it merges into the emotional scene perfectly and elevates it to another level. (end of ep 12, )

Overall, this drama performs strongly across the board and ticks many of the right boxes for me, other than a few imperfections here and there. Although I wouldn't call this drama perfect, it comes pretty damn close in my books. I think I'm already experiencing withdrawal symptoms having finished the final episode an hour ago. It has been one heck of a ride, and now that it's over I feel like there is an empty void within me that's not going to be easy to fill. But giving credit where credit is due, hats off to the Hotel Del Luna team, as they have created something quite special and unique. Worth a watch, especially if you're an IU fan, as this drama is all about her.

I like the concept of “playing devil’s advocate.” But when it comes to examining dramas, I don’t play around (usually. Get some sugar in my system and we’ll see otherwise). Thus, this review will consist of me gravely defending the “devil’s” opinion that Hotel Del Luna is an okay show...but also that it's not too much beyond that.

If ghost stories lie within your watching preferences, perhaps you would have a better time with Hotel Del Luna. As for myself, I was not a fan of the overall plot. It came off as a tad too shallow. For one, there’s a severe imbalance between plot filler (which is how I classify every individual ghost’s story, each of which occupies 80% of each episode) and the truly interesting main plot, which falls off to the wayside. Unless you enjoy brief appearances of random guest ghosts, you’ll probably end up like me: sitting through over an hour’s worth of time per episode, helplessly asking when the Hong Sisters will address Man Wol’s story—which is rarely, until you cross the halfway point of the entire show. What the writers do with Man Wol’s history when it is addressed feels lackluster, if only due to all the unnecessary time buildup prior to it.

The real problem is that we are hardly given reasons to care about each visiting ghost in any major emotional capacity. Although they have interesting stories, it’s a bit like walking down a city sidewalk: you see someone with a pretty wardrobe, “ooh” at it for a second, and then forget your appreciative impressions of it an hour later. Maybe it seems as if I’m being coldhearted, but as much as the Hong Sisters try to emphasize that these ghosts were human with human sufferings, the way the show frequently relies on shock value and horror elements over the ghosts’ pain and healing resulted in me not being able to build true sympathy for these souls. Imagine repeating this apathy for every episode: it’s exhausting trying to force an emotional connection.

The only saving grace of Hotel Del Luna is Man Wol. The way IU presents her character’s conflicting ego and heart is as poignant as it is mysterious, and she executes the identity of a CEO with a low economic IQ with hilarity. Had it not been for this quirkiness of Man Wol’s character, I would not have stuck around until the end. And that’s despite my love for Yeo Jin Goo: though his acting is excellent as always, Chan Sung is a perfect example of a supporting character who hides behind the guise of being a “main character.” There’s only one protagonist in this story, her name being Man Wol. There’s nothing wrong with this, but it is a bit of a letdown that everyone else has the potential to be equally interesting, yet doesn’t get nearly enough development. Chan Sung, for example, is a nobody—beyond pushing Man Wol to address her emotional wounds, he doesn’t possess the individualism that a lead character should have. This means that while the interactions between him and Man Wol may be compelling to watch, the moment that you isolate Chan Sung away from her, he devolves into a character who’s mediocre at best and painfully boring at worst. Seeing as I view Chan Sung like this, that should give you a pretty good idea of what I think of the other supporting characters: meh.

That all being said, I can see the reasons behind the hype. I just wouldn’t say that they’re justified: gorgeous cinematography, a cast list riddled with famous names, and an amazing soundtrack are all great assets to have within a drama. If future shows could continue Hotel Del Luna’s ability to create an effective atmosphere, I would have zero complaints. But what use is all of that if the show at its core doesn’t match up to the level of its decorations? Hotel Del Luna is almost sadly entertaining in that it may be fun in the moment, but doesn’t leave a deep enough impression to be phenomenal.

This may be the only drama, after Goblin, that made me cry- and I'm not much of a weeper!

The story line was new and refreshing, and it was filled with moments that were relatable, hilarious and heart breaking. After watching the final episode,I came to the conclusion that this was, in my opinion, one of the many masterpieces of Korean television. The actors all had great chemistry together, especially the main leads. I really liked the way each relationship was explained and portrayed. Because if this, the last episode had me bawling my eyes out as we said goodbye to each of the staff members. Also, the ending to me was brilliant. The way that they all were connected in their next lives made me so happy as I felt like they all got the happy endings that they deserved, especially Man Wol and Chan Sung.
Don't even get me started on the OSTs for the drama. Although most of them were quite slow and emotional, each artist brought their own flavour. My personal favourite was Done For Me by Punch as I really enjoyed the music, and the lyrics had so much meaning behind them.
Overall, I can say without a doubt that this drama is an incredible story, and is now one of my all time favourite dramas ever!
P.S. I really wish that Kim Soo Hyun's cameo in episode 16 was a hint at a possible season 2?

The director of My Love from the Star and While You Were Sleeping, Oh Choong-hwan and the dynamic sister writing duo, Hong: Jung-eun and Mi-ran of The Greatest Love and Master's Sun repute collaborated for the first time and masterfully cast a very potent spell by transporting us to the spooktacular world of Hotel del Luna, a place of healing and rejuvenation for ghosts as they teeter on the precipice between the mortal world and the great beyond.

Every episode of Hotel del Luna is amusing, captivating, intriguing, stirring, and thrilling due to the perfect balancing of humour, fantasy, myth-making, drama, romance, and horror further enhanced by the gorgeous costumery of the female lead, visually-dazzling production, heartstrings-tugging soundtrack music, cameo roles, and socially-relevant sub-plots that tackled: molka epidemic; prevailing patriarchal assumptions; and toxic netizen culture.

Two of the most popular young actors today, Lee Ji-eun or better known as IU and Yeo Jin-goo exude palpable chemistry in their memorable lead performances as Jang Man-wol and Gu Chan-seong, respectively. The accursed millenium-old Man-wol is the alluring, chic, ethereal, luxurious, and petulant chatelaine of the mystical and marvellous Hotel of the Moon while the dashing, dutiful, empathetic, and courageous Harvard graduate Gu Chan-seung serves as the hotel's 99th or current human manager.

Veteran thespian Seo Yi-sook leads the trio of superb supporting cast as the mysterious deity with several identical manifestations. She is joined by Shin Jung-geun who plays the 500 y/o untimely-killed Joseon top scholar-turned-hotel bartender and by Bae Hae-sun, the 200 y/o grudgeful murdered daughter-in-law of a privileged clan who is the hotel's meticulously efficient room service supervisor. Also starring are promising actors Lee Do-hyun and Lee Tae-sun; idols P.O and Mina; and Cho Hyun-cheul and Park Yoo-na. Jung Dong-hwan as ex-Manager Noh and Kang Ho-seok as Grim Reaper are also endearing in the portrayal of their special characters.

Hotel del Luna, although a fantastical drama, is actually a foray into the reality of life. It teaches among other things: that like flowers from the moon tree, life is beautiful yet fleeting - and so, we must make the most out of it; that humans are endowed with the ability to make choices and are consequently tasked to bear responsibility for the choices they made; that life is not always easy or fair - as such, we must learn to play the hand we're dealt with much courage and grace; that if the past is a source of suffering or ill-feelings, we must learn to let go and make peace with it and with ourselves if there's nothing anymore that can be done about it; that our way of thinking and feeling can have a powerful outcome or influence; that revenge is sweet for it provides an outlet for pent-up aggression and wounded feelings, but, at the same time, it is also burdensome and masochistically painful for it recoils and does not diminish with time, thus inflicting endless pain on the person who exacted vengeance; that forgiveness has a rending and liberating power; that love has a transmogrifying power which can contour our character - either for the worse or for the better; and as Gu Chan-seung has perfectly shown us - that true love is self-abnegating or it makes you forget yourself and seek the welfare of your beloved.

Unfailingly riveting until the end, Hotel del Luna will for sure hold a place in the hearts of many of us. A big kudos to the writers, director, actors, and production crew for making this drama an enjoyable and worthwhile watch.

Hotel Del Luna is one of the most hyped drama of 2019, accomplices of this hype is the pairing of IU/Yeo Jin Goo with Hong sisters screenwriters. Unfortunately the drama failed on so many level that, despite this two great premise, I cannot consider it a good drama.

The plot is totally unbalanced when it came to quality of writing, one part of the story is about Jang Man Wol's past and her personal story, a wonderful story about a character who is serving an eternal punishment for a revenge happened in the past. The flashback moments are basically the best part of this show and the contrast between old/present Jang Man Wol is superb, IU did a great job in portraying different personalities.
Instead of making a drama entirely dedicated to this plot, the Hong Sisters decided to fill in the rest of the drama with boring sub-plot about hotel management and ghost hunting. Qualitatively speaking, the present story doesn't hold up to the past story.

In addition, the Hong sisters failed to develop interesting characters outside IU's role. None of the other characters can compete with IU's performance, the show was made for her, written for her and invested tons of ""money"" on her, with beautiful outfits, make-up and accessories. It almost seems that the Hong sister first wrote the role of IU and her personal story, then when they realized that they had to fill 16 episodes they added crap as much as they could.

Even the great Yeo Jin Go couldn't do much about it, his role was weak from the start, a scary kid that end up working in a hotel full of ghost, despite his good acting skills, the personality of his character wasn't strong enough to compete with IU's charater. Other characters were mere filler, they explained a bit about them but most of the sub-plots were closed only during the last 4 episodes, sign that the show didn't give them much space and importance.

The romance is another giant failure of this show, the initial chemistry felt between IU and Jin Goo during the first episode disappear complety when the role of Go Chung Myung came out. I was too curious about their story to care about a Jin Goo, in addition IU and Ji Goo moments together were very slow and the romance take a long time to sail.

If we consider that most of the drama was shot inside the hotel, the director had to exploit a lot of other elements to entertain the viewer, as already said, they have invested a lot in the appearance of IU, with beautiful outfits. They also used a lot of scenes that provided color games (the tree in the hotel) and the beautiful soundtrack. But as I always say, making the most of some good element of the drama doesn't hide a weak and poorly written script.

They say that Hong sister are a hit or a miss, HDL was a miss and it survived only thanks to the hype.

The Hong Sisters Have Finally Returned To Wonderland..

For most watchers first looking over the drama, Yeo Jin Goo ( Hwayi; A Monster Boy and Moon Embracing The Sun) would seem to be one to steal the show from his legendary roles in numerous dramas and movies , yet, instead, it is IU ( My Mister and The Producers) ‘s role as the angel-faced yet foul-mouthed owner of the hotel, Jang Man- Wol who instead quickly steals the show from Jin Goo in her glamorous frocks.

From inspired attires straight out of Daphne Du Maurier’s gothic modern romance tale , Rebecca ( 1938), to Katherine Hepburn’s little black dress in a favourite film of the Hong Sisters, Breakfast At Tiffany’s ( 1961), IU
truly embodies the mature and complex core of a cynical female lead who is shaped by her own experiences and choices rather than merely love itself.

Yet whilst the casting of the show is fairly diverse with fellow Kpop costar P.O being cast as the giddy hotel receptionist and Bae Hae- Sun as the strict housekeeper of the hotel, some of the roles within the show (especially the storywriting ) felt slightly lacklustre in comparison. ( Particularly P.O and Kang Mi- Na’s romance as their respected characters, which did have some bittersweet moments in particular to P.O’s character, but Mi Na’s character Soo- Jung had little relatability despite her tragic circumstances).

Admittedly this isn’t entirely the fault of the actors as one noticeable flaw which arose in the drama was how the Hong Sisters had added little complexity or emotional value in regards to the respected storylines of some of the other characters (excluding Man Wol of course). The biggest example of this arose with Jin Goo’s character, Gu Chan-Sung.

Man Wol was supposed to be the fiery ‘Yang’ to Chan Sung’s level- headed ‘ Ying’ personality within their relationship, there was little to actually express or delve into Gu Chan- Sung apart from the evident plot roles. His father dies several years presumably after his first scene in a flashback in the show , yet Chan- Sung neither really expresses anguish nor heartbreak at this fact. Whilst there is the arguable emphasis that Chan-Sung is too rational to break down over these matters, this is greatly contradicted within the scene when Chan- Sung simply loses his composure at a bus stop over thoughts of Man- Wol. Undeniably a heartbreaking scene and a moment of brilliant acting from Goo, this scene just doesn’t entirely add with the intended composure of Chan Sung who in several episodes prior, who didn’t bat an eyelid to the return of his mother as a ghost.

This also moves us onto the other problem of Hotel Del Luna; how the storyline played out. Ironically, Hotel Del Luna’s biggest problem wasn’t trying to adhere to the typical cliches, but instead trying to overcome them at the last minute. Obviously, there is nothing wrong with a drama doing this, however, where the evident flaw lies for Hotel Del Luna is that rather than only doing this a couple of times to mark a red herring by diverting the audience’s attention ( and then deliver an actual plot-twist by moving onto the expected becoming the unexpected), the Hong Sisters tried to do this at every given opportunity during the storyline. Without spoiling anything, I will say this. The novelty of the storytelling becomes less effective when you did this too often, and so whilst Hotel Del Luna was certainly interesting within certain character plot-lines ( particularly Jang Wol’s past), some of the show for a major part felt anticlimactic and disjointed in the long run.

On a more positive note, however, Hotel Del Luna’s magic is greatly brought to life through fairly good CGI and storytelling upon this element. Whilst not entirely touching new ground in the face of predecessor shows like Goblin , Hotel Del Luna still brings its own element of dark fantasy through traditional Korean mythology being brought into modern Seoul. From disturbing evil spirits, bartender ghosts like Kim Seon Bi ( Shin Jung- Geum) to deities such as the mysterious Mago ( Seo Yi- seok) with unpredictable plans of fate for our main characters.

Additionally, whilst the finale of Hotel Del Luna has caused a lot of debate amongst drama fans, the bittersweet ending was surprisingly appropriate for the drama . Overall Hotel Del Luna was an enjoyable watch (although perhaps flawed by some elements of the storyline and certain characters’ contributions to the show )-the elements of dark fantasy, traditional mythology and IU’s stellar performance as the twisted and cynical Man- Wol will keep you captivated. Although not flawless, definitely worth a watch.

This review may contain spoilers
I am not going to lie, I felt extremely frustrated while watching this drama. It had amazing potential, but close to nothing worked out. The beauty - amazing cinematography and styling of our main character, and the beast - the writing.

There honestly is not much to say about the characters, since the only one that had true depth was Man Wol. She was the centre of the drama and IU did an amazing job representing her development and gradual change. Chang Sung could have worked way better if it wasn't for Chung Myung. All the rest of the characters we simply did not spend enough time with, to truly care about. I must say, Sanchez was my favorite and he was the breath of fresh air. That said, all the problems I had with the characters could have been solved by better writing.

Kim Seon Bi/Choi Seo Hee/Ji Hyun Joong aka when writers do not care.
Out of all their stories, only Seo Hee's had some depth to it. Kim Seon Bin's story was extremely random, there were close to no hints about his previous life so I did not even care to speculate what happened to him. Hyun Joong's past life story had the least sense. How did his sister not recognize that the guy taking care of her was not her brother. How did his family not ask any questions, why did they recognize her and not him? You could say it was a war so they did not see him for a long time, but the same would apply to the sister. Hong sisters did not care enough about those characters to spend time to truly explain and develop their stories. They had the material for a good 8 episodes of Man Wol's story and had to fill the rest with random storylines. I could not feel emotional about them all leaving at the end, because all I could think about was: It all does not make any sense.

I also believe it would be better to start sending away the characters around episode 10-12, and not just have them all gone in the last 2 episodes. We could slowly see how Man Wol is realizing all the people she loves and cares about are gone and moving on to the afterlife. How the ones that stay behind struggle with the loss. We would see her being more concerned about how will Chan Sung deal in the future when she is gone. Them gradually leaving would have more impact on both the characters and the story line.

Chan Sung/Chung Myung aka the failed romance
While I enjoyed Chan Sung at the beginning, the moment we got more scenes with Chung Myung and the past story developed into something interesting, I could not focus on the present. Chan Sung was simply a boring character that was there only for Man Wol's story to develop and he had nothing going on for himself. When we met another male character that had a past romantic relationship with Man Wol, but also was its own character, it was easy to forget our male lead. At the end of the day I wished for more flashbacks and less present plot. And I would rather have them as friends than as romantic partners.

Kim Yoo Na aka no one truly cares about anything
While I enjoyed Yoo Na, I do believe they should have made her a more tragic character. Yet again, there was no depth to the story. Show me how much she struggles to fit in that new house, how she misses her old friends and family and how she is tired of pretending to be someone else. Sadly, we did not see any of that. She was there for plot convenience and side romance, but yet again, there has been nothing to her character as an individual.

All the hotel cases aka when you try too hard to please the viewers
I did not truly like any of the random hotel cases, but I hated some more than others. The most random one with the humans having sex in the hotel room to have some superior child in the future. I was truly confused why this plotline was in the drama.
There were too many cases, so at the end, none of them was developed or complex. They tried to fit any genre (horror, crime, romance, melo, etc.) into the drama, just to make sure any viewer can find something they may like.

Disney ending aka when you are afraid to commit to the tragedy
None of the characters involved in the drama had a truly tragic ending. Which was extremely unrealistic. It could be easily fixed. Make Yoona too late to say goodbye to Hyun Joong. After Seo Hee goes to the bridge, cut to the mother registering the baby with the father's surname because of the grandparents. Make the book about Seon Bi flop. I would even like for Chung Myung to vanish because he used all his energy looking after Man Wol. The Song sisters wanted to show us how sad, tragic, and emotional the feeling of loss is, but they did not want to show the truly ugly side of it. Because of that, the ending felt bland.

Overall, during the whole watch, there was literally (and I truly mean it) only one time when I thought ""wow, this is a good writing, I finally feel the playoff"" and it was with how they used the Coffee Writer Dude. They spent just enough time for us to be curious about him and wonder what will happen to him, when he will go to the afterlife.

At the end, Hong Sisters had an amazing idea, about an amazing character, and no idea what to do with the rest. Trying to fit too many stories of too many characters made this drama a... mess.

Sadly, Hotel del Luna's fanciness couldn't make up for the story's lack of coherence and sincerity.

The extravagant hotel for the ghosts and the splendid clothes of its owner didn't quite impress me. Each episode has the same dreary pattern of spirits struggling and protagonists babbling at the end. After the first half of the show, I found myself neither interested nor thrilled.

The answers were already laid out so I didn't get the point of dragging out the story. The antagonists which I once thought of as formidable opponents were easily gulled and defeated. Indeed, there is a fine line between a show with a high-caliber script and one with a mere show-off wardrobe.

If you want to watch a romance comedy drama with some thrills then this is a must. The storyline doesn't get boring in the middle or you won't have to worry about the acting quality since everyone that showed up nailed it. It has great OST that match with the story and the ending is what you'd expect that is not disappointing.

Each episodes contains Goo Chan Sung trying to help the ghost go in peace while Man Weol unexpectedly ending up helping him through his persistent. The chemistry between the two grows as Chan Sung persistently work his way through Man Weol's heart. There is a lot of special guest coming in throughout many episodes, but even the surprises will make your heart go wild.

Overall, I give it a 10 star (not for exaggeration) but it had a great flow of story, great actors/actresses, and also OST!

Did not live up to the hype
The whole production was amazing- cinematography, ost, scoring, production design, etc. BUT the love line really did not make sense to me. It felt too pushed for fans’ sake. The writing on the second lead’s ending was too lackluster, it’s like the writer gave up on the character to save Yeo Jin Goo some face, as obviously he got overshadowed by Lee Do Hyeon as a character and as an actor (c’mon, let’s all agree on that).

Plus this drama’s ghost stories as fillers were too obvious as fillers. It’s like watching a variety show with an MC introducing the fillers one by one because it’s THAT obvious. It took a lot of screentime too that you’d eventually realize that the main plot was actually very short and so-so if you take out all the ghost stories.

If you came for the hype, then by all means watch it. The cinematography was definitely astounding. Its novelty was also commendable, I truly learned a lot about Korean folklore, thanks to the characters. BUT don’t expect it to watch a Best Drama contender for Baeksang because that’s definitely not what you’ll get, unlike what the rating promises. Acting was so-so too, a bit disappointing actually since you have Yeo Jin Goo and IU as the main leads. Lee Do Hyeon stole the show.

IU and Yeo Jin Goo are some of my favorite stars in the Korean entertainment industry, but I never expected them to end up in drama together. I enjoyed seeing them together on screen. The Hong Sisters have written some of my favorite dramas and I often really enjoy their fantasy dreams, though I must admit that in recently they have not been as strong.

This drama had that bit of a fairy tale vibe about it that I really enjoyed, and I felt lacking in their previous fantasy show. There seems to have been put a lot of effort into it, looks wise at least, which made it really cool to look at. The drama looked stunning. The clothes that IU wore were frenzy, the scene was done, and the special effects were well done.

The story wasn’t terribly original, and you can very easily point out similarities to other dramas like Goblin - another hugely popular drama about a fairy-tale creature that lived for a very long time and falls in love with a human being. Or just other stories about ancient being falling for mortals. There are plenty of those to go around. But I do like this version of the story. Mainly because here that ancient being is female, which is rarely the case.

And that magical being, Jang Man Wol (and of course IU), stole the scene every time she came on the screen. And the fact that she got to be the main star there, in a role most often assigned to a male character in similar stories, was what made this drama sorts of unique to me and was one of the main reasons why I liked it so much.

Yeo Jin Goo, though perhaps a better actor than IU, did not get to shine all that much in this drama. His character was sometimes just there. He was out connection to the human world to us and the ghost characters, but he was also just there to make Manwol open up and find love again - a role most often given to the female character. It got on the nerves of some people (understandably) but I enjoyed the role reversal a whole lot.

Some of these ghosts of the week (as I call them) didn't really do much for the plot, didn't link it too much together and were often just there to act as fillers while we waited for more on Manwol's backstory and gave the characters time to do something as the story chucked along. But Manwol’s story was the focal point of the whole drama. But even if it happens quite slowly, but I didn’t really get that bored. I enjoyed a lot of this extra bits (even if it started to drag the story a lot towards the end) and some of the side characters that the drama gave us.

I was impressed by some of these ghost stories were told and some of the more fantastical storylines, though they became weaker as we went further into the story. The Hong Sisters are usually good at mixing ghosts and some of the more traditional romantic comedy plot, but they also tend to loose their hold on that as the story goes on.

The romance in this one was a bit on the slow-burning side of the spectrum. I expected a whole lot more from it at the start of the drama. There was never any great spark between IU and Yeo Jin Goo. That chemistry where you felt they were right about kissing every time they were together. I was a lot softer than that and the romance a lot quieter than I expected, but you really got the sense that they really cared about each other.

The story, or the romance, was never too tense. It was more just sweet. But I really enjoyed that. The intensity was more in Manwol’s backstory, so while some might find the modern version of the show a bit boring and lacking compared to that, I felt like it created a bit of a balance between the two stories. And that part being more somber and mellow made the backstory stand out more. However, it also made the story kind of just fade out towards the end instead of going out with a bang. It was nice, but maybe not super rememberable.

It was a mellow little noona-romance and I liked it. There was more chemistry and drama in the other storyline, but this one had that fairytale vibe. Unlike other stories, like Goblin, it was never creepy that one person was immortal and the other was not. And I think the role change helped. And I enjoyed that.

The story wasn't big enough for these sixteen episodes. It was rather simple. But what the drama may have lacked in story, it sorts of made up with style and a kickass female lead, which I was kind of okay with.

After all, this was Manwol's drama, where her character and her backstory were the strongest point of the drama. Her backstory could have been its own drama. And IU is so charming in this role. This drama would be lifeless without her and getting to see a female character in such a role is not something I see every day (both in kdrams and other shows). I shall remember this drama for a long time because of Manwol.

Who doesn't love a good reincarnation story or finding resolution/closure for wandering souls? However, the one word I can sum this up in is ""long-winded"". I watched the entire series through severe fast-forwarding and ended up with a pretty weak ending.

The positives to say is they did focus in on the backstory of your main leads and your main supporting characters. I found myself looking forward to unveiling of everyone's past that was presented in bits and pieces. The chemistry between all of them worked pretty well. The only major disappointment was our lonely firefly who was misunderstood for so long and then just pretty much kicked to the side. It really downplayed the strength of their long tragic love story and made it too real, where one easily replaces another these days. Why build up the lovely surreal to smack us with this coldness of reality? It would have been fine if it didn't feel so awkwardly done.

The cases where they assist souls in resolving issues was also a bit below average. It started off fairly interesting but just slowly descended into not much. If you're an absolute romantic, then you might enjoy this piece more than I did. As much as I appreciate a good love story, this one dragged on too much with each scene unnecessarily. It didn't help with the excess flashbacks that assumed the viewer didn't pay attention at all a couple of episodes ago. Overall, it wasn't great and it wasn't terrible but doable in higher-speed viewing.

This show had a a lot of hype behind it and I was excited. However, maybe it was over-hyped and I was a little underwhelmed. The concept is great and right up my alley. At hotel who's clientele is ghosts sounds like it would make for super interesting story lines. The cast does a great job IU is the highlight. She embodies this women who has been trapped so well and her story line is the best part of the show. Though the other ghost staff is also great. The set design of the hotel may be my favorite part of this show it is just gorgeous I could just watch the scenes in the hotel on mute. What really lets this show down is the episodic ghost story lines. The show choices to divide each episode between the main story and the ghost of week story and in those is were the show falls flat for me. I just didn't are about these ghosts the characters were trying to help. Also the episodes were a bit to long I feel like they could have cut some unnecessary parts and made an solid 60 minute show rather then 80-90 minutes that drag.

I'm writing a review after a long time with fresh feelings.

I just now finished watching Hotel Del Luna and boy oh boy - it was pretty much the same I felt about it ep 5 onwards.
Most of Hong Sister dramas have been a hit or miss for me and this falls closer to miss than hit.

Story/Premise: I was looking forward to it since months ago when IU started teasing about this drama on her Instagram. The premise seemed fun and the first few episodes were solid. Then from ep 5 it started becoming repetitive and the episodic format lost its pull for me. I was more interested in the main characters than the useless subplots introduced every week in an episodic format. Some were good and most were just meh. There are two parts to the drama : the flashbacks and the modern story. The flashback was solid and a winner for me since the beginning to the end. In fact I was way more invested in the flashbacks than the ongoing struggles of our characters.

Acting/Cast: IU was good for me in her role. This is not the best she has done nor the worst. But she is definitely one of the highlights of the entire cast. She carried it strongly with her presence for most part and was a delight to look at. She is so PRETTY. Yeo Jin Goo did nothing for me here and I say this as his big fan of past projects. I feel like he lacked the maturity to play this particular character and it would be better for him to take on lighter and more youthful roles. Then again, most child actors fail to shine once they get older (I might be triggering some of his fans here but just being honest). I felt no chemistry between the leads although individually they weren't the worst. The hotel side characters were all good actors expect PO. He was just cringey and horrible and even a rookie like Mina was better by a step- but who cast this girl? I LOVE the actors in the flashbacks. I see a lot of potential in both who played Chung Myung and Yeon Woo (I am poor with names). I am not familiar with their past works but would love to check out more in the future.

Music: The OST is solid. I would recommend the tracks by Punch (both), Taeyeon (it is lovely), Gummy and Paul Kim. Rest of the songs are good too but these ones stood out to me. I have them on repeat and will continue to for some time.

Final Thoughts: I feel like they had a nice idea that they failed to execute well. Romance with Yeo Jin Goo was a snoozefest for me. The premise was good but it was a weak and lackluster script. Had the writing and casting been better, it would have been one of my favourite dramas. I did enjoy the random references to variety shows and the celebrity cameos. The ending was fine for me and I wouldn't have settled for anything else after the way they set it up all along. I was not happy with how they ended the 'older story' loop because I was enjoying it too much. The last episode was sad but had nice moments. I think the best part was the epilogue. This universe comes to a certain next stage and watch it yourself to check out who they cast for the ""sequel"". It was a surprise and I can't wait for it. ^_^

Hotel del Luna is a fun light hearted fantasy rom com that can keep you easy company in case you watch to watch something fun and light to relax and switch off your mind.

As far as the plot is concerned, commendable world building by the writers here. The story is based on a hotel that exists in between of our and the afterworld, in which spirits, with unfinished business, go before moving on. Deities, malevolent spirits, reapers, interesting backstories ect are a given.

With such an interesting premise I gotta mention the main characters who were pretty fun. The drama generally focuses a lot on comedy, which, most of the time, hits the spot. The romance is there and plays a predominal role. I can't say it was particularly memorable, but it sufficed.

Moreover, it should be mentioned that the driving essence of the drama are the back stories of the main two protagonists, particularly IU's character, something that becomes apparent from the very first scene of the drama. The show beautifully connects ancient eras with modern times linking present and past lives in a worthy backstory that is interesting and well-written without ever becoming too serious or heavy. Every prominent character gets their development and their sub story. Everything is fun and well written.

A strong part of the drama is IU's character, her fashion, her facial expressions, her reactions, her sassyness. It could be argued that this is an one woman show written entirely on and for IU, which, in my book, is totally a pro. If you're an IU fan, you'll enjoy it.

My favorite part of the drama was the homage to horror pop culture (references to classic scary movies, ex. The ring), or mentions of other recent horror kdramas (ex. The guest), which made the whole scary context that much more fun and contributed in making this drama feeling like a part of a whole along with the fun recurrent feeling of parodying horror pop culture.

The acting was overall great, but not really memorable. The plot was too light hearted for any of the actors to showcase any actual talent. That being said, everything was executed magnificently.

Overall, this is not a bad watch if you are interested in rom coms with fantasy elements. There are several ghost substories that aren't that important and not scary at all, but pretty interesting and fun to watch, so there is also that. The OST in this one is particularly polished. I'd recommend this to everyone searching for something light and fun to pass time. That being said, there is nothing notable about this drama other than its base premise.

Have a nice day everyone and enjoy!

Disney movies and shows have always been about showing things in a beautiful manner visually and emotionally while imparting some important lessons along the way or towards the end.
This show is just like a Disney production, spectacularly set and lavishly comely to the eyes. But this one just keeps us reminding about the impermanence of such beauty. It establishes promptly that throughout its run, the theme which is gonna be addressed is ‘to learn to let go and move forward’ .

While the stories of different guests were interestingly written while being emotionally deep, it is the main story of the leading couple which suffers from blatant inconsistencies and unnecessarily dragged to diminish the effect of goodbyes.

It sets the show and settings really well in the first few episodes. The comedy works out well here and there. The romance of various couples other than the main one were not sidelined and were actually more interesting when viewed with their backstories and connections to the main plot than the main couple.

As the show progresses the different guests and their issues which sometimes get infused with the main story keeps the show going rather the romance of the two leads.
Still it manages to make us give a little attention to the main story with its flashback sequences with classic viewer deceiving tactics.
The deception works because it keeps us reminding that despite all this extravagant and pleasing looks, there is so much tragedy and sadness within the main character.

It has comically yet interestingly depicted the concepts of God, Heaven and Afterlife, It has meddled with those concepts to create serious and comedic dilemmas for the characters which was interesting to watch.

Even though the side stories were thematically same, each of them had its uniqueness a sort of fresh wholesomeness to them. It was sad yet prepared us for the impermanence of life itself with unexpected variety of stories based on all living beings.

While all the different stories of various ghosts prepare both the viewer and the main characters for the inevitable separation, some bad writing choices greatly falters in closing the show well. It subverts the effect of that inevitable separation just to prepare one of the characters to accept that split well.It also remains irritatingly vague after that particular decision in writing which actually disrupts the core theme of moving on. Thus it stretches out the main arc and also postpones some closure for characters to the frustration of the viewer.

The most alluring aspects of this show is its music, OST, grandeur in sets and visuals.The inside of the hotel, costumes of the lead and depiction of different eras were splendid.

The music and original songs were adding to the mood of the scene, comic and tragic. It really brought out the emotions which were hidden in the visual grandeur.

A dreamy series filled with visual opulence driving home great message necessary for everyone who is alive faltered along the way to decrease the effect towards the end.

The shining part of this drama was IU, if I'm being completely honest. Her acting has improved tenfold since she entered the game, and she's just such a captivating lead. Not to mention, her makeup, styling, and wardrobe team were absolutely on fire for this drama — props to them for dressing and styling her so gorgeously and uniquely for every single scene.

As for the overall drama, while it's not bad, it's really not anything super captivating. It was also definitely way longer than it had to be. Most conflicts were either too easily resolved, or resolved in a way that I didn't understand why there was a conflict in the first place. And while I loved the cast, there was just a huge lack of chemistry between them for some reason.

I loved the was Man Wol was written, but what lost me was the romance. The romance really lacked progression. Suddenly Man Wol and Chan Sung were in love and I had just zero idea why. There was just no real process to it, plus the leads had NO chemistry. I'm sorry y'all — I love IU and Yeo Jin Goo, but just not together.

What saved this drama was nice production quality, a killer soundtrack, and great acting from IU though.

I was compelled to write a review for this drama since the ratings misled me way too much. This drama had the recipe for a perfect fantasy romance but when served, most the parts were either cold or half-cooked but looks very good. There were good moments in the drama, but those were so sparse that it didn't make sense to watch an entire one hour episode for it. I feel sad that such a brilliant plot premise got executed like this. I'm always down to watch a good fantasy drama, especially one with romance, and had high hopes for this one. Let's get into the details now -

The plot line captivated me from the get go. I knew there would be past connections, betrayals, healing and just a truck load of heartfelt emotions. I got half and half of everything. The stories of all the primary ghosts were sidetracked and stretched far more than they could handle. They lacked the substance and depth to be spanned across 10+ episodes. In contrast, some of the shorter stories of the ghosts were more interesting.

There are instances where the story tugs at your heart but it fades away without leaving a trace. I felt no genuine connection between the main characters. Nothing. From the first episode to the last, I never smiled or frowned or cried with them. The secondary story of Man-Wol's past stirred me deeply though. I teared up every time their memories were shown. Which made the way their story was concluded even worse. A story spanning 1000 years was thrown aside, bid good bye without shedding a single tear? I felt that, as a viewer, I was cheated at that moment, having invested so many hours warming up to the ghosts of the past only to have them vanish as if they were nothing.

Maybe it was the way the character of Chan Sung was written but it was a chore to watch him. Everything about him is perfect on paper, but his personality felt so flat and two-dimensional. Man-Wol on the other hand is one of my favorite characters so far. Her feisty nature and personality commanded every scene she was in. I give her 100% credit for coaxing me to finish the show. I only wanted to watch her character evolve. These two as a pair felt forced and unnatural. The few scenes that Man-Wol had with Yeon-U and Cheong-Myeong had more feels and emotions than all the scenes of Man-Wol and Chan-Sung combined.

The acting was really good, a great cast indeed. If I keep aside the way they were written, the actors all portrayed their characters flawlessly. IU is a delight to watch in every frame. Her dynamic performance as the temperamental Man-Wol is one of her bests yet. The music of the show is hands down one of the most memorable ones I've come across, the OSTs are definitely going to be an addition to my playlists.

To be fair, this show is by far one of the most beautifully shot dramas I've watched. The production was top-notch. The cinematic elements were really really good. But they still couldn't make up for the depth that the story lacked. I'm afraid this might just remain as one of those dramas that could've been. Maybe I've been spoiled for good by the likes of Moon Lovers (which still makes me weep when I think about it). If the elements of fateful encounters, reincarnation, supernatural intervening interest you, there are better shows out there than this one. If there ever is a sequel like the end credit hinted, I hope they build a solid foundation of story first rather than a flimsy card castle painted in gold.

Pros: IU and her character (including her backstory), the visual aspect (most of the time) and a few funny dialogue moments (the intelligent kind of funny what I appreciated).

Cons (for me): One of the most boring and cheesiest dramas I have ever watched.
Genres: Action? So little that I find it ridiculous that it is listed...
Suspense, Mystery? A little bit.. but not the thrilling, addicting or exciting kind (for me).
Horror? Yes but not really creepy (kdrama ""horror"" average). Not really a con for me though.
Romance? Yes but ""a bit"" boring (for me) - mostly there for comedy and the emotional weight of the drama.

The best things about it were IU`s character and the visual aspect. But they relied way to heavy on it. They overdid it sometimes with the colored lights, the fogg and the emotional ""moments"" (when the characters paused because they just thought of something (emotional) and on cue 3 seconds later a new soundtrack would begin (this felt like 80% of the drama).
Yes IU`s play of emotions on her face was good and because of that and because she is so beautiful it ALMOST didn't get boring. Even though the drama touched on the heaviest subjekts it stayed relatively shallow on them (which made it - yes BORING) while still trying to emotionally wring us out like a wet towel as often as possible. I guess my emotional well dried up too fast because I was often over it and started to get... Also not a big fan of long & frequent ""staring at each other, frozen in the moment"" moments...
I only watched this drama because of IU and because for ONCE I was actually okay with watching something slightly boring. Though I didn`t think it would be so unexciting. The plot has a nice sentiment but is really not impressive.
I also found ALL the characters except IU`s boring.

I am mainly just disappointed that they didn't have an exciting plot and intriguing characters to go along with the nice scenery. Because of the budget, IU in the cast and the genres I had hoped for something epic.
When will we ever get something like ""You Who Came from the Stars"" again (with a age gap in the romance under 20 years (at least of the actors) please!)?!

Beautiful cinematography, beautiful costumes, a lot of cameos, but that's it.
The backstories of some of the important characters are weak with several plot holes and the acting of the both main actors are weak or may be they are miscast especially IU. She was perfect in ""my mister"" but here she didn't convince me at all. For yeo jin-goo, I've watched hime in ""the crowned clown"" and sadly I'm not a fan of his acting.
The story is original (slightly inspired by beauty and the beast) but I didn't like it especially towards the end.
My favourite character in the whole drama is Sanchez :D

It’s a k show not a kdrama
My transition from cdrama to kdrama wasn’t the smoothest but let me just say this is probably one of the decent one I have watched. Still boring and predictable with every situation being the same and barely any chemistry improvement. No kisses no hugs at their most vulnerable side just aloofness. At this point, we can just called it a show rather than a drama.

Story: omg. Seriously, every situation was almost the same the only difference is the character, the setting, the idea, more involvement of different rule to this concept, and the event that’s it. This is literally a show not a drama; every situation only impacted the male lead, and the female lead is acting like a support giving guidance to him that’s it. This is literally just show about different ghosts impacting the male lead that’s it; it didn’t improve their relationship for the worst or for the best, and their relationship remains the same after the situation about the ghost: it didn’t contribute anything to the growth of the female lead and the build up want even there. The perception of the male lead is impacted that’s it. The female led is still arrogant and aloof with her coworkers on the outside: she probably already has the kindness in her heart, but it’s just never expressed and the male lead was only there to express it. Literally so boring and predictable. I could literally be watching another episode of criminal minds but with ghost smh.

Character:
Male lead definitely has improved in terms of his PERCEPTION of the idea but the chemistry hasn’t and so is his personality, which isn’t entirely a bad thing but still.
Female lead is just another freaking supporting character there to protect the male lead without any chemistry. The one dynamic change you can say is her loneliness and her sober heart that’s it and anything else? That’s it
She liked the male lead and the male lead likes her back but there chemistry wasn’t literally non existence I swear. There are just there to say it but has there been anytime where they would actually demonstrate it through something like a hug or a kiss? She only demonstrated her caring and arrogant side of her when disputing about the chemistry but that’s it. The male lead’s character just feels like he wants to care for everyone so I can’t really tell if that’s love for her
The “breakup” was so dumb; it didn’t change anything about their individualities or anything their perception of each other is still the same, which is they care for each other and can’t live without each other: it didn’t improve the character or anything they just have the same relationship as a boss and employee

OST
Omg every time any ost plays it was so beautiful-especially Taeyon’s singing . I enjoy all of the ost, and this is the few drama that has all of the good ost.

Acting and visuals
Omgg iu is so pretty like literally iU queen; I would literally be excited to see her every she appears on screen. One of the few times I have actually liked the female lead more than the male lead. The visuals are on peakkk

Hotel del Luna is one of my favorite k-dramas of 2019, and in my opinion, is not just a hyped up drama that doesn't meet it's expectations.

STORY:
I've seen many complaints of the fact that Hotel del Luna was heavily filled with filler arcs and did not focus on the main story enough. However, I disagree, the filler arcs were not pointless, in fact, without them the story wouldn't make sense. I thought that the filler arcs served the important purpose of showing the character growth of Man Weol as well as the side characters throughout the story. After each arc, Man Weol learned another lesson and changed to become the person she is by the end of the drama. And for someone who's not a fan of filler arcs I didn't feel bored by them at all. I thought that the story was well paced and not slow despite the filler arcs. There were suspenseful and unexpected moments that made the drama interesting watch, and there was a good balance between the horror, romance, and comedy aspects of the show.

ACTING/CAST:
Man Weol definitely was the star of the show with a refreshing personality and complex backstory that made her character so appealing. She was hilarious and badass, but still had flaws and scars like any normal person. However, the other characters were just as good. The employees of the hotel also had their own backstories and character growth. I enjoyed the banter and interactions between them, and they definitely added to the enjoyment of this drama. I thought that the chemistry between the entire cast was great.
There were also complaints that compared to Man Weol, Chan Seong's character was lackluster. To some extent I agree, his personality and traits were nothing unique, but he didn't need to be, I thought that his normalness compared to crazy ghost world was his charm that separated him and made him a lead character. He was a good balance to the extravagance of Man Weol, and his loyalty and ability to sacrifice for others was admirable.

MUSIC/CINEMATOGRAPHY/ETC:
The cinematography was beautiful and the music was just as amazing, but one random thing that just happened to catch my eye was the fact that Man Weol literally changed her outfit like 5 times in an episode. Her outfits has to be one of my favorite things because they were beautiful and just perfectly matched the extravagant nature of her character.

Disappointing
First time warching a Korean drama (I am in UK) but when you are under lockdown you have to take what you can.

Very different from English speaking shows, not really helped by some interesting sub-titles. The acting seems overly exagerated and dramatic at times, but that may just be how Korean drama is.

Sets and costumes extremely lavish and overall story good, but tries too hard to fill the time.

Ending was sad for me and not what I was expecting. Was Man-wol a ghost, how did she die?

I read they are making a US version so I expect the ending will be different.

The snoozefest I didn't see coming
Hotel Del Luna (HDL) was an extremely hyped up drama when it came out in 2019 and I thought the title was appealing in the sense that it really evoked fantasy cinematic vibes. Having briefly looked at the premise however, it reminded me a bit too much of the 2013 drama, The Master's Sun (TMS). Despite being a human, the leading lady in that latter named drama also had this exceptionally rare capability of being able to see and communicate with spirits; thereby being an exact replica of Gu Chan-sung's (GCS) character here in HDL.

Now it's also important to keep in mind that these kinds of themes/ideas are unique to a specific writer(s) for a drama, and so as it turned out, it was none other than the Hong Sisters who wrote the scripts for both HDL TMS. So, in that respect, perhaps one of the many reasons why I didn't enjoy HDL as much was because I found myself re-watching a drama which had almost the same plot focus as its predecessor. Having said that, HDL was just not hype-worthy sorry to say, but what I will say is that it was exceptional in many other aspects other than its storyline.

Firstly, I commend the people in the costume department for providing such an exquisite array of outfits for Jang Man-wol (JMW). I've never seen anything quite like it before to be honest, whereby the female lead had about ten different outfits, hairstyles, and accessories per episode which in many ways, was all thanks to her character's impeccable taste in fashion. Secondly, the production was quite amazing needless to say; I could not fault one episode which did not scream ""attention to detail"". In particular, I was in awe of the grand magnificence, size and classiness of the hotel.

However, was this enough to save the storyline?

Characters

If I can recall correctly, there were about six deities in total which starred in HDL (i.e. rich, poor, life, death, health, and love). Each served a different purpose, but it was mainly just one which really contributed to JMW's existence (save for the rest which had more involvement with GCS's character).

In terms of JMW's character, I thought there were some aspects of her which painted her to be quite headstrong, but also many others where she came across as needy and short-tempered; thereby making her seem like a damsel-in-distress and very unlikeable. But just some further examples. First, thriving off money and luxurious purchases to be able to live is not a new concept in the K-drama world - without this materialistic aspect, JMW would be nothing she says. Second, JMW's elegant fashion sense and mesmerising beauty no doubt won the heart of many viewers, but that alone could not save her character's god-awful temperament.

GCS's character was well... I'm not sure? I love Yeo Jin-goo, but his character I felt was more like a supporting cast type of role rather than a breaking male-lead kind. The characters around him were so twisted yet he treated them all nicely only to become their sacrificial lamb. Not to mention, why him? All of JMW's previous human managers could have been given the same responsibilities and duties as GCS thereby speeding up her process of heading to the afterlife by helping resolve the wishes of her hotel berieved guests. Sure, I get her past managers weren't all men, or as young, handsome and savvy like GCS, but at least they were humans who were emotionally present and could have helped her realise her mistakes sooner if Mago planted that moon flower inside any one of them.

As for Mago and the five other Mago's - why are there so many is my question? I understand the purpose of each one, but I found the whole premise of having a ""deity"" to be extremely convoluted and random by the end. The deity of health and wellbeing for example - I mean, what does she do with all the other medicines she makes apart from the flower-based drink JMW eventually drinks? Deity of wealth - extremely random and unnecessary given she appeared for less than 5 minutes to give JMW advice and then poof into thin air.

Storyline

Well, this one was just lacking in all aspects. I understand JMW spent 1,000 years living to right her wrongs but why did it take that long when another human could have landed the scapegoat role within that time?

Not to mention, there is no plot hole - the plot is simply finding out what murder she committed (which was hardly a surprise by the end) and then being freed from the chains of the tree which tied her down initially. When I read the plot analysis and saw the sentence ""for a crime she committed but could not remember"", I just thought well, what crime could be worse than murder itself? It's pretty self-explanatory isn't it? But the most predictable was her finding out the crime and then being sent to the afterlife before coming back as herself (I think it was) at the very end.

Come to think of it, the only plot holes were that of the ghosts - why did they die? How did they die? What were the circumstances surrounding their death? In many ways, they weren't all that interesting considering most didn't even talk and had to keep leading GCS on a chase/mission to help them get to the afterlife. That said, their sidestories were more powerful than JMW's.

Also as we are all aware, what is a drama without a plotting romance between the two leads? Sadly, and much to my dismay, I felt absolutely zero connection between JMW and GCS. Whilst you could see that GCS cared deeply for JMW, and JMW very subtly did the same, there was no romance to simply put it. For there to be romance, you have to feel it - the intensity, the chemistry and the pain in the eyes and portrayal of emotions.

Other comments

Unfortunately, the camera compositions and flashbacks became very tedious to look at. The tree, the entrance, the grand hotel foyer, and hallways, etc. - each setting/backdrop did very little to present new ideas and was more or less the same each time. For example, the significance of the Moon Tree was that it claimed JMW's immortality and in many ways served as a powerful symbol of growth, death, and rebirth. Yet, a lot of the time was dedicated to the protagonists standing in front of it trying to pull out any emotions you would have developed towards them and sure, you may feel some sympathy towards JMW, but not me. Similarly, the hotel served as a safe haven for lost/restless souls who were unable to move onto the afterlife but by the end, its purpose was made redundant when it disappeared after JMW's ties with the Moon Tree severed.

Finally, the flashbacks were repetitive and didn't add any excitement to the drama. While I understand each flashback served as a memory/indicator of the people JMW was surrounded by, including the events leading up to JMW's vengeance, they did very little to contribute to her character growth. In the present, she remained just as arrogant, uptight and vain as she was/did in the past and that made it all the more difficult for me to feel any sympathy for her. If anything, I thought JMW's ties to the hotel and Moon Tree served her just right, and felt way more pity for GCS who was chosen to be her sacrificial lamb.

Very hyped and very much of a let down.
Honestly for such built up hype, this drama seriously failed to deliver. I.U. was not the best actress to represent this role but that also is a conflicting aspect, as I.U. is honestly the best at representing a struggling character from a lower class. But her as a rich character just doesn't fit, although her feisty acting style was very endearing.

Her character was a little too inconsistent, it was almost as if she was suffering from hysteria or bipolar disorder throughout the entire drama.

The male lead on the other hand, had almost nothing special to offer, and his character was an infuriatingly excessive ""good guy"" character through and through. His cowardliness was a little excessive as well.

As always when a Korean drama or movie showcases Korean deities, it's just infuriating or extremely irritating. In attempts to be ambiguous they become redundant and self-contradictory and do things in roundabout ways, when far more efficient solutions exist.

Supporting characters had depth to them but at times ignored that for cheap drama intensification.

Cinematography was great, essentially very similar to goblin but the SFX were nowhere near up to scale and at times just horrendous. Music was okay.

Overall, a decent drama but nothing great.

Disappointing
If you like a good strong female lead then just watch the first 20 mins of ep1 then leave it at that. The rest is just a slow painful walk towards yet another strong female being walked all over due to ""feelings"" ( ffs shes been evil as hell for a 1000 years). It makes no sense, its patronising to see yet another korean woman (evil ghost, whatever) ruined by their inability to overcome love just because a guy ""looks kinda cute"" (1000 year!!!! Plenty of cute guys mustve come across her path!). I know IU isnt everyones favourite but i thought she did well given a terrible script so any points i gave above 0 for this mindless show were for her, male lead just looked a bit weird tbh ( im not into blokes but i can at least tell ugly from good looking and his acting was wooden at best).

Absolute candy for your eyes and ears!!!
One glance at the cast shows why Hotel del Luna is and will be one of the most talked about dramas of 2019. A second glance highlights an interesting premise, and more in-depth research reveals HDL’s insane ratings and chart-topping music. The only blemish is the screenwriters, the infamous Hong sisters, though many love their work. Unfortunately, HDL does not quite live up to the hype, and I find its substance a bit lacking, much like candy. Still, I’m sure HDL will be a must-watch for most viewers regardless of what I say, but maybe I can lower your expectations just a hair. Who knows - maybe you can better appreciate the show without such lofty expectations.

Story:
I am not purposefully trying to rain on the parade, but the story is the weakest aspect of Hotel del Luna. To HDL’s credit, fantasy is one of the most challenging genres to pull-off in kdramas (said another way, it’s easier to relate to human dramas). The other two Hong sister supernatural dramas I have seen are The Master’s Sun and My Girlfriend is a Gumiho. I am not a huge fan of The Master’s Sun, and I have a feeling that Gumiho has not aged well since its debut in 2010. The Hong sisters are a master of the romcom craft, and the overall story remains surprisingly coherent through its multiple time period settings.The balance of romance and comedy is also carefully weighed, and each piece of HDL’s episodic format adds to the main underlying plot and tension.

Many may think that HDL’s plot is incredible based on what I have said thus far. The true challenge that HDL does not quite surpass is a relatable and believable gravity within the main plotline. It is not enough to say the main character waited hundreds of years for this moment and expect all viewers to immediately empathize with her. HDL fails to adequately address some critical questions: Why wait hundreds of years? Is this really a problem/challenge? The Hong Sisters’ responses are sadly insufficient. Looking back, one of the root causes is that too many subplots, plots, characters are covered over 16 episodes, even if each episode is over one hour long. As a whole, the story, while intriguing, did not leave me thinking about it throughout the week like some of my favorite dramas.

Acting:
Hotel Del Luna boasts two of the hottest main leads of 2019, IU and Yeo Jin-goo. I had 2 thoughts before starting HDL: unsurety of IU’s shedding of the idol-actress image and the poor taste left after Absolute Boyfriend. Let me caveat that I did not finish the most recent dramas starring IU or YJG, My Mister and My Absolute Boyfriend, respectively. In HDL, both exceed my lowered expectations. In comparing the 2 leads, Goo Chan-Sung shows a narrower range of emotions and often plays the straight man, shutting down many of Jang Man-Wol’s anctics. YJG executes this role with precision and professionalism, plus he’s only 22! I look forward to his future performances as he continues to grow as an actor.

Jang Man-Wol experiences a much wider range of emotions and actions, and I cannot confidently say that IU is a bonafide top star (of acting) yet. The main reason is because the casting of IU is as much a part of her success as her acting chops. HDL jumps between romance, comedy, and drama frequently and sharply. IU’s execution, like YJG, is exceptional, but sometimes it looks more like IU playing multiple characters vs her portraying one consistent character. Furthermore, IU puts together a more convincing character in the “drama” scenes than the romance and comedy scenes, and the chemistry between the two leads is just short of electric. All around, I praise IU for committing to her acting career and participating in different genres of dramas/movies, and I fully expect her to become a topflight actress sooner or later.

Here are a couple thoughts on the supporting cast. Overall, the supporting cast is as wonderful as the leads, but they lose major screen time to not only the main leads but also to the guests who fill out the episodic format of HDL (again, a criticism more of the story than acting). Of course, there are weaker areas, one being Kang Mi-Na. Her character is convoluted and a difficult challenge for the young actress. Hopefully, she grows and follows/exceeds IU’s acting career trajectory. To end on a sweet note, I am a huge fan of Kang Hong-Suk and would love to see more screen time from him in the future.

Music:
The backing cast of artists for Hotel del Luna is incredible, especially for kpop fans. Even the non-”pop” singers are well-respected veterans of kballad. So, I won’t get into every single song and artist from the OST. I will mention Song Ha-ye because she is relatively “new” (5+ year vet) and may be lesser known. Her track, “Say Goodbye”, fits great with the drama, and her latest hit, “Your Regards”, is definitely worth a listen. My favorite track from the OST is Heize’s “Can You See My Heart”. It didn’t top the music charts like Taeyeon’s or Gummy’s, but I still listen to it on repeat! Also, nearly an hour of original music for a cable network drama?! HDL shines bright in countless ways.

Rewatch Value:
Writing this review made me reconsider my thoughts on Hotel del Luna as a whole. I would enjoy HDL more had I binged the drama instead of following the weekly releases. Since I found the main storyline slightly unconvincing, my interest in HDL wavered while waiting for a new episode. It is entirely possible that I bump up the overall rating by half a point after a binge rewatch. However, I do not have any plans to rewatch HDL at the moment.

Hello my first review. As a super casual k drama fan ( seen less than 5) I am extremely conflicted on this show.

Let’s keep the good good. The cast is fantastic and the production and music was so special that I was convinced during the shows run that this was a once in a lifetime classic.

But without writing an essay I can just say that the bad is bad. The storyline was a fantastic procedural... new cop solving ghost cases with his immortal goddess. I like a lot of the twists and cases.

The problem is that they turned it mid way through to a central storyline and went halve ass on everything. Sanchez girlfriend... main leads mom... even the bartender stories. No substance at all

Than the love story was non committal. I can’t for the life of me convince my wife the main character even likes IU. He made no effort except acceptance. If this was a show about accepting death... I seen many people tell their sick love ones they love them. They don’t just eat meals and wait for a cry scene.

Also laziness at end. They introduce time travel... Childhood connection... IU not losing memories on bridge.... reincarnation... multiple gods with conflicting goals.... but nothing explored just a quick give up and painting fantasy.

I can tell from the show that the main lead is smarter than me. And I can easily see a path to save her. He even bought her to the past to see snow.... (freakin send her to the bridge in the past!)

Anywho. Lack of effort and interest after the past life means that the writers thought episode 14 was the ending. Shame they didn’t end there

Likes: A strong heroine. IU’s fab wardrobe & timeless beauty. Yeo Jin Goo’s gazes. The beautiful set design. The banter. The slow burn.

Dislikes: Kang Mina’s superfluous storyline with P.O. Some of the subplots.

Written by the Hong Sisters, I was excited to watch this fantasy series as I generally like their dramas because they know how to pull the heartstrings and they do the enemies to lovers theme well. And it didn’t disappoint!

Let me just say that IU looks stunning in this drama. Her wardrobe was beautiful and theatrical. They did a great job with the hotel design as well, creating this hauntingly beautiful environment. IU did a fantastic job portraying the dark and world weary owner of the mysterious Hotel Del Luna, a hotel for the dead. I just loved the fact that the female in this story is the strong one, the protector. So many dramas portray the guy saving the girl a bunch of times, but here, it’s the opposite. Jang Man Wol is one cool character.

Yeo Jin Goo plays the upright assertive hotelier who’s at odds with IU’s money hungry ways. Yeo Jin Goo pretty much can do no wrong in my eyes in terms of acting. The dude is just a phenomenal actor. Every expression looks natural and real. He had me laughing at so many parts.

And when you pair him up with IU’s opposite personality, the scenes just light up. The banter made me laugh, the yearning made me sad. The slow burn is what I live for. I definitely think they could have trimmed some of the sub plots and I wasn’t a fan of the P.O/Mina love line or even Mina’s character, but overall I really enjoyed this drama

I loved IU in this, she was great, Yeo Jin-goo on the other hand not so much. As for the other characters it's a mixed bag really, there were some great ones & some really weak casting choices. I loved the audiovisual experience, whenever beautiful cinematography meets music this amazing is always a treat.
I did not feel the chemistry between the leads, Yeo Jin-goo's bad acting perhaps? To me it feels like the Hongs tried to recreate the goblin experience, but their writing just did not live up to the task. This is their worst work so far I think. Don't misunderstand it's not bad by any means, but it's like an empty shell compared to Goblin. Even though I think the last episode was pretty good, I just wasn't emotionally invested enough in the characters to really feel the melo, so to say.

So basically I started to watch this drama because of Yeo Jin Goo and IU. Had pretty good hopes. This drama gave me more than what I expected. Oh Choong Hwan and Hong Sisters have certainly given what we wanted.
The CG was damn cool and amazing. The story keeps you stuck to the screen and makes you watch the episode again to get hold of the mysteries going around (I almost watched each episode twice :P).
Talking about OSTs, they are seriously worth listening to. According to me, they have a major role in making the audience love the drama along with the amazing story.
About the actors: The cast has been chosen quite well, where you will love each and every character of the drama. The writers have given each and every character its own importance. IU, yes she is really beautiful and has done justice to her character and so has Yeo Jin Goo.
We cry with the characters, laugh with them and feel what they feel at the same time. The drama has also focused on some social issues which are a great way to reach people and make them aware.
If you are a fan of fantasy, comedy, and romance then this drama is certainly for you. For me, this has been the best drama of 2k19. Loved it to the core!!

Story: Very similar with their Hong Sisters) previous ghost story, though I'm not telling the Drama titles. But what do we expect? It seems that this is their favorite genre. I like IU's past life story but the present one is dull for me. It seems that the male lead is always relying on the female lead. Subplots are unclear too, specialy the male leads' mother, why the hell she left her kid behind and why is she hiding him? No explanation for this.

Acting: The only reason I finished watching it is because of IU. Period. I was really bored with other characters, even the male lead.

Music: OK

Rewatch Value: NO. There are no special scenes for me to be rewatched, All I do was cry on the last episode. I hate that. This kind of drama is not comforting. Not emmitting good vibes. All I can feel while watching is the approaching sad ending. Although there are so many good moral values that the drama can impart, it seems that the story just wants us to be slapped with reality that there's no happy ending on earth and everyone just dies. Why so cynical? It's a drama, they should atleast comfort the viewers.

Overall: My 5.5 is purely because of IU , her performance and her outfit.

I didn't expect this drama to leave this much impression but from cinematography to acting, it couldn't be described in words of how beautiful this drama is. What made this drama impressive is the fact that the old-era storyline was so nuanced that I became invested on it as much as the modern storyline. This drama while maintaining its romantic essence manages to covers nuanced and serious themes that revolves around today's society such as political corruption, accidental deaths, online bullying and many more. The drama made an excellent way of making all the characters' likeable by having their story leave a deep impact. In addition, the veteran actors really shine in this drama by showing its deep chemistry and relationship with body language. Although some actors did need work, their relationship was still cute and bearable! Lastly, I would like to focus on Goo Chan Sung (Yeo Jin Goo) and Jang Man Wol (IU) relationship. This drama became one of the most prominent ones I have watched due to their face-acting, gesture-acting and voice-acting. Every words they say feels like they really meant it and you really become invested with the emotions which makes you feel like you first-handed experience it. Not to mention, the fact this is also due to assistance of excellent soundtracks and cinematography that made every scene become much more memorable!

After all of the positive things I have heard about this popular Kdrama, I have decided to finally give it a go. It took me a very long time to finally finish the series, I kept on stopping and putting it off after intervals of watching 2-3 episodes of the show. I can see why it is that popular: the cinematography, the lovable cast, the amazing OST and the fantasy theme that takes you back to the times when Goblin was still airing. But I will never fully understand when people say it is their favourite drama. Personally, it is lacking in so many various fields, especially with the levels of engagement. As mentioned before, I was about to drop the show, but it suddenly became very good towards the end. Why did the director and the scriptwriters keep us on edge right from the beginning, but instead decided to make the drama full of thrill at the end? It is mind-boggling. However, I did enjoy the complete storyline, as I am a fan of folklore and the Korean cultural elements, which dominated the drama. IU was a brilliant actress for this drama, and she keeps on improving and improving with every role that she acts. Additionally, I loved the fashion and overall aesthetics that she brought out. The male lead, on the other hand, I did not like: nor his character, nor his acting or the chemistry between him and IU. The tragic love story of the hotel owner tore me to pieces, and I wish they would have chosen to reincarnate the general. I would say the secondary characters were more favourable than the leads. Moreover, the amazing OST is a huge part of why I like this show too. There are so many great singles, all equally as beautiful and sung by very talented singers. In the end, would I recommend this drama? Yes, I feel like it is a definite staple of a drama to watch, but for me, it is a watered down version of Goblin. There is definite room for improvement, but it is a great watch with fascinating cinematography and soundtrack!

IU dominated this drama...
I was not surprised to witness another stellar performance from IU. This woman is just so talented that she always over-delivers regardless of how big or small her role is. IU as Man Wol was the perfect angsty and badass boss lady. Her angry scenes were so scary and credible (and funny too). Oppa found those moments absolutely cute and adorable.  But even if Man Wol's supposedly jaded after living a thousand plus years, IU is still able to convey Man Wol's fears and vulnerability through her magnificently dramatic eyes. She handles heavy drama really, really well. Some of my favorite moments were the scenes where her friend Yeon Woo (Lee Tae Sun of Prison Playbook and Suits) was executed and all of the scenes where she and her staff had to move on to the afterlife. Those were heavy moments but IU handled them with so much restraint (yes, no loud wailing) while still managing to deliver those emotions with a lot of intensity. I felt so sad for Man Wol. Living that long and unhappy life must have been really hell for her. But I also understood (and appreciated) where the Mago (various deities all played by Seo Yi Sook of Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol and Start-Up) was coming from. The Hotel was like purgatory for her - a place where she's given the opportunity to make amends for her past sins. She would have vanished as an evil ghost but the Mago probably thought that her crimes were somehow justified because she did them as revenge for what happened to her people. I was glad that she got that chance because I knew she was a good person.  No, Jin Goo was not as spectacular as IU. I felt he struggled quite a bit during the heavy drama scenes that required him to cry, hence, he had to resort to covering his face most of the time. But IU's in a totally different level and I don't think it would be fair to compare them. Overall, I was happy with Jin Goo's delivery. I loved his steady and reliable acting especially during the scenes when he had to persuade the feisty Man Wol. 
I loved how Chan Sung always reassured Man Wol that he would protect her, be by her side, and never allow her to go into the dark side. And how he kept that promise! I loved how Chan Sung would always hug Man Wol whenever she was doubtful or afraid. Those hugs were definitely one of the things I looked forward to in the show. They made me feel so secure. 
And Man Wol always did her best to protect Chan Sung too. I loved it when she said that although the dead are bound to lose their memories as they walk along the bridge to the afterlife, she would hold on to her memories of Chan Sung for as long she can. And I loved how she kept that promise when she sent off her first love, Go Chung Myung (Lee Do Hyun of Prison Playbook), on that bridge. Man Wol was not swayed and she never forgot her promise to go back to Chan Sung. 

One of my favorite themes in the show is the inclusion of reincarnation, specifically Man-Wol’s past life characters showing up centuries later in 2019. It’s quite entertaining watching her hold grudges towards oblivious people that affected her in their past lives, such as Mi-Ra and Yeon-Woo. In their past lives, Yeon-Woo was Man-Wol’s best friend and Mi-Ra was her sworn enemy. However, in their new lives, Mi-Ra and Yeon-Woo are a couple, to which Man-Wol doesn’t take well. I have to say that I kept waiting for Yeon-Woo to get a more interactive role in his new life, maybe develop a heart-warming friendship with Man-Wol again to help her cope with the 1000 years of isolation and loneliness she endured being bound to the hotel.
There are a lot of twists and turns surrounding Man-Wol’s love life, with constant flashbacks to her previous life relationships we develop an understanding that she is waiting for her past love interest, Chung-Myung, to return to her and walk the path to the afterlife together. However, throughout the drama, there is a slow-developing relationship between Man-Wol and Chan-Sung that could seem forced to some or just inevitable, but it results in Man-Wol having to choose between the two further on in the drama. 

I loved the music in this show. They definitely helped set the mood, especially for the drama scenes.

I was happy with how the show ended. Yes, it was sad. But that was the right and logical thing to do. Chan Sung's love for Man Wol was so great that he no longer wanted to see her suffer while living her long and unhappy life. He let her go and he trusted that their love for each other will bring them together again in their next lives. Overall, I think that IU well presented the beautiful yet avaricious character of Man-Wol and will forever be a fashion icon for me. It’s a show where you must pay attention to the plot and make up your own theories and conspiracies, which just makes it all that more exciting.

HDL or Hotel del luna was one of my most awaited dramas. I've been binge watching it from the start and to tell you it was my first ongoing drama. But this story is worth it.
Acting: I really never thought a combination of IU and Yeo Jin Goo. But after seeing this I started to ship this couple. I would especially highlight the work done by Jin Goo, he was just amazing. He is portrayed as a coward at the start but the way he transforms himself for IU was lovely.
Story: There is everything in the synopsis so I won't go with the detail. This story has a lot of fun elements and you'll never get bored. The thing which I liked the most was that it does not just focuses on the male lead or the female lead. But every single character's life is very well portrayed. Coming towards the end, it has lots of uos and downs. At some point you might feel like-"" No this can't happen "" But slowly you'll be able to overcome it.

Overall,... I loved it. And if you are planning to watch it, then please don't waste your time here and just go watch it now. It's worth your time..

I do not know why some are having such a low review of this drama. Below is my thoughts and no spoilers. You are going to have to watch it :)



Where does one begin..I have seen many K-Dramas over the last 6 years but only a few have I set to memory and will watch over and over again. Hotel Del Luna will be one of them. The drama was marvelous from the beginning. The chemistry that the cast had was amazing. The story line kept me coming back for more every weekend. If I was to compare this drama with any other dramas it would be Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God, because they all had chemistry, amazing casting and story line. All three tugged at my heart strings.

Let's not forget the music..awesome just awesome..I will not say more because I do not want to spoil this drama for anyone..

Just have a box of kleenex you going to need one.

everyone probably heard about the beautiful glamorous clothes, the hair, the makeup, or the beautiful aesthetic scenes that made me personally take +130000 screenshots, but the most beautiful aspect of this drama was the acting! both IU and Jingoo are top tier actors, and every scene with them was magical.. granted, every actor left a huge impression on me, I think I'll have to add a few to my srs list -especially Kim Soo Hyun! ;)
they had the best teamance, and those final scenes with them was beautiful...

the best compliment I can give a drama is ""I wouldn't have been able to writer a better drama than this""...
this is my soulmate of fantasy dramas, the best of the best! probably the only real fantasy I truly enjoyed from start to finish~

one of the things I loved about this was that they didn't make the plot the only point. usually they give us a glimpse of ""conflict"" at the start, then forget about it and bam last ep is here and everything is solved...
here the characters -all of the characters- were the main focus! they solved their plot gradually ep by ep.. and each side plot was related to the characters journey. by the time we get the last two eps (minor spoiler) they got their sweet time to solve the final chapters of the main characters stories and that was beautifully done~

I actually want to brag and compliment this drama way more, like manweol is my perfect woman, and chansung is a dream....
and so I'll end it with this: this is what happens when top notch acting meets top notch characters, plus a well balanced well thoughtout story~



my rewatch values are 1 or 10, but I'm already planning my rewatch of this~

I definitely have a love/hate relationship with dramas by the Hong Sisters, which often have a fantasy/fairy tale element to it that can sometimes be too much for me, but I think they got this drama just right. Hotel del Luna creates a unique world of the dead that I didn't expect to love as much as I did. There are so many elements to this drama (fantasy, folklore, action, mystery, romance, horror, and comedy) that seamlessly come together to tell a memorable story. The storytelling may have not always been perfect, but visually it was perfect, and it sucked me into a world that I really wanted to believe in, with stories that kept me entertained from the beginning to the very end. However, the main reason to watch and the true star (or rather moon) of this drama is IU as Man Wol... and her outfits!

I loved the entire main cast of this drama, but IU's character is so amazing that I became a fan from the moment she appeared on the screen. Yes, I've liked her in other dramas (especially in My Mister), but in this role, she is not only a bad@ss, and funny (I loved her sarcasm), but she had an elegance that was epic and even regal! I also love a good villain and Man Wol was the perfect balance of heroine and villainess which made me never quite sure what she would do. She is matched with the super talented Yeo Jin Goo as way too empathic hotelier Goo Chan Sung, who I thought was a good match, but I admit that there were moments when he seemed a little out of his league with her, but that also worked for their dynamic in the story. He mostly plays the straight man, which I'm sure isn't easy to do in such an over the top drama, but he has the right kind of likable innocence to make him perfect for his role too. As far as romance, it definitely plays a large part in the main story, but it's pretty platonic. Their chemistry is basically some cute flirting, funny banter, and eating so don't get your hopes up beyond that.

I also have to mention the rest of the hotel staff Bae Hae Seon, Shin Jung Keun, P.O, and Mina. Instead of just being comedy relief, these characters each have strong stories of their own, and by the end, I became attached to each of them. Then there are the flashback sequences, the stories of the hotel guests, poor rich Sanchez, The Grim Reaper, and of course Seo Yi Sook as the many faces of Ma Go Shin... and every single person in the cast is great! With a story this over the top it can be hard to make certain moments not feel too silly to be believed but they really pulled it off. The fun visuals also helped. Many of the stories are light horror stories, or are mysteries that need to be solved, but mostly centering around revenge or longing. I unexpectedly connected emotionally to a few of the stories. Maybe it's because death is a touchy subject for me, but I also think it's because the writing in each episode was good, and made me think about how precious, and sometimes cruel life can be. So keep this in mind if you have recently experienced a loss. This show may be comforting in some ways, but it may also be too much to handle.

The only reason I gave the overall story a 9 instead of a 10 is because some of the explanations and resolutions seemed convoluted. The overall story is so ambitious that I think they sometimes missed the mark in tying loose ends in the story. The last episode is a perfect example of that. I loved most of the last episode, which resolved things so beautifully in so many ways and had me in tears throughout, but in the final moments, I was just left scratching my head. It didn't make me like the drama any less. I'd rather watch an imperfect but original drama like this than a predictable and boring drama.

Would I watch this again? Yes. I know a lot of people seemed to want a second season (Oh, make sure you keep watching past the credits), but I'd rather just watch this again. It may seem less mysterious with a second viewing, but maybe I'll catch some things that I missed the first time.

Overall I liked this drama a lot. It's not going to make my favorites list, but it's certainly one of the most memorable dramas I've seen in a while. I usually don't like dramas that focus on random side stories too much, but I guess these stories are my taste (I admit Halloween is also my favorite holiday), and I loved the repeated theme of making peace with the past at the end of life. It's also surprisingly lighthearted considering there are so many dark aspects to this drama. Think of it more like an old school fairytale and you will have a better idea of what to expect. It really is a beautiful world, full of amazing imagery (That bridge!) and a gorgeous hotel (I really wish it was real!), so the director definitely deserves praise for that. I also love that it all centers around such a strong female character, and her amazing wardrobe! Seriously, every single outfit deserves applause! This is not your average ghost story, and even if I loved The Hong Sisters Master's Sun more (So Ji Sub has A LOT to do with that though), I understand why this drama has so many fans! I recommend adjusting expectations and giving this drama a chance. Who knew that a drama about death and deep resentment could be so cute?

Thank you team Hotel Del Luna for such a wonderful drama. I loved this drama, For me this is the best Korean drama I’ve watched. Great concept and storyline. Everything was up to the mark. The drama turned out to be so good because of the team effort. All actors played their roles so well that their acting makes you love each characters. Iu is a treat to watch❤. Yeo Jin-goo chemistry with IU is amazing.They made my heart flutters many times. First few episodes are funny, but then it becomes emotional towards the end. All Ost's were the best. Highly recommend to watch it. love from India❤

Well this was an interesting show to get into. Even when I was 2 and a half episodes in - I could see this show’s super high quality. I felt it was really well written and that a high budget was put into it.

The highlight of the show is Jang Man Wol. Her personality is unlike most female characters and I loved her stern but playful personality. It’s the first time I’ve seen the cold woman/warm man trope and I was pleasantly surprised by it. Jang Man Wol had a past that I was interested in for once. Most flashbacks do nothing for me but in this show I was keen to learn more about her backstory. And her fashion sense!! Every outfit was breathtaking, stunning and on point. Her makeup, and hair as well. IU is a truly gorgeous woman. [She also reminded me of Kaguya from Love is War. Both shows were released in 2019 and from the personality to her looks, Jang Man Wol is almost the real life version of Kaguya.]

And may I just say, I have seen endless dramas where we get a glimpse into the main character's past + first love (when the main character has lived for decades) and this is the first time I've actually really shipped the couple!! This couple has so much chemistry - just like the present couple. I am impressed. Not many dramas have succeeded in this, nice job writers. Their story was tragic like Romeo and Juliet. It made me wish they could be together in another life. I really wished when they met again in the present that they could have had a tad more closure. Even if they could have just hugged, or something. It broke my heart that he stayed with her since the beginning as firefly, as her guardian and she had been waiting for him the whole time and never knew. I just think they deserved so much more. But you know what they say; first love doesn’t always work out.

But of course our main couple had just as much chemistry, and they got a happy ending. Let’s talk about Koo Chan Sung - aka the most perfect human male on the planet. At the start he may seem quite vanilla, and you wouldn’t be entirely wrong. But he honestly just has a heart of gold. He does the right thing every time, is good at everything, is intelligent, and will help anybody wholeheartedly. He sticks by Jang Man Wol through thick and thin and helped her start to make better choices. I loved how at the end, the reason why she likes the plump food-eating star is because of him. In a way, they kind of did meet in their past lives. I found it so funny that he told her past-self “I must return to where I came from, to return to the woman I love very much” and she was jealous, and then when reunites with her present-version he says “I just denied a drink from a very beautiful woman” like XD. He loves messing with her and I live for it. I really did feel like their love was just so genuine and real. Their dynamic just worked and a great example of opposites attract.

Another thing I loved about this show was the colouring and all the magical elements. I really liked how the fantasy setting was done. In fact, this show reminded me of Goblin in many ways. From the reincarnation, deities/gods, immortal-having-lived-centuries main character and ghost-seeing love interest. Both protagonists are immortal beings who are paying their sins for the deaths they caused in the past. The overall vibe of the show is very similar.

And finally: the soundtrack was so beautiful too. Had so many emotional songs and they fit with the show SO well.

Overall, this show was a solid 8. A good watch.

I finally watched this after much debate. I had considered skipping it altogether because I doubted how well IU's acting would be. Scarlet Heart proved to be a major letdown where she simply failed to deliver during the most emotional scenes. What a pleasant surprise it was to see that she had improved since. Overall I did enjoy the show but did not find it as bingeworthy as I would have expected. Maybe it was the longer episodes, where sometimes I would catch myself being distracted and not paying attention. The backstory between Manwol and Chungmyung was beautifully captured and delivered. It almost made me wish that was the main story instead. The main leads, seemed to lack some chemistry. I just did not feel the same attraction as I did with Chungmyung.

Overall very aesthetically pleasing with the constant outfit changes from IU and the OST was beautiful. I would say for me, it was more a show I watched more for the nice visuals over the storyline.

I liked the drama but I think the ending felt rushed. I think the writers spent too much time developing Man Wol's past and too little developing the resolution of it. Her meeting with the captain was supposed to move me as much as the flashbacks did, and instead it felt shallow. And the ""princess and Yeon Woo are getting married"" seem too much like a rushed way to say ""this part of the plot is closed, MOVING ON""...
I was a little bit bored by the ending, tbh. I don't think it was a bad ending, but it wasn't a ending that made me fangirl or be like ""woah, this is amazing"". I really liked, however, the talk between Choi Seo Hee and the pregnant lady about how that baby is her baby before anything else and it's going to carry her last name. I also liked how the five characters of the hotel are found family tm. And I must admit that, in a way, I see Man Wol and Chang Sung more as sister and brother or really good friends than romantic partners. I'm sorry, but I didn't feel any chemestry between them (and I'm watching Moon lovers right now, and let me tell you, Iu and Lee Joon Gi is wow), and while I appreciatte the way their relationship was written, I was left feeling meh about their romantic scenes most of the time. Which kills me because GENDERSWAP BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like, I did like the development of their friendship and I do understand how they came to be a couple but Man Wol and Chang Sung romantic scenes didn't move me as much as Man Wol and the captain, tbh.
Which brinsg me to people saying Chang Sung was boring and, let me tell you, I don't think he was. I think is really good to see a male character being the nurturing one, the one who choses to be kind and give second chances and believe the best of everybody else. And I don't think he was naive, I think he understood people but wanted to give them a chance to prove him right in making the ""right"" choice. I think he's cunning, kind and interesting. I do wish the story focused a little bit more of him outside Hotel del luna, though. Like I would've liked to see him arriving to New York and see a little of what he was doing, and so on. Again, I don't think the ending was bad, but I wanted to see a little bit more of the people left behind and the ending felt rushed.
I liked the acting. I think the ones I liked the most were IU's, Bae Ha Seon's, Lee Do Hyun's and Kim Mi Eun (who played the ghost bride).
The music was really good, I think it fit the kdrama really well.
The filming was amazing and I know people talk about it a lot, but the aesthetics were goals. And yes, I'm one more in the line of ""God, I wish I had a lot of Man Wol's wardroble""

Manwol is the GOAT
Story: An interesting premise that started strong, lacked in the middle, and ended strong.
(+) the romance is endearing and mature. I know a lot of people had second lead syndrome but I personally enjoyed Manwol and Chan Sung romance. They bicker and tease but there is so much affection and understanding.
(+) finding out Manwol's backstory was interesting
(+) The second couple was cute
(+/-)beautiful CGI- it was really good in the beginning but wasn't as prominent/good later in the show
(-)Because the episodes are over an hour long I easily got bored of the week to week ghost stories. I think it would've worked better if the show was 20-30 minutes.
(+/-)bittersweet ending

Acting/Cast: IU owns this role! Not only is she amazing as the 1300 year old CEO but her scenes in the past- specifically her crying scenes got me.
Jin Goo was also great but his character was not as strong or developed compared to Manwol. He was interesting in the beginning but as the show went on his character was more of a support system to Manwol.
The rest of the cast was great but I'm disappointed that all their side stories were rushed at the end. I would have rather learned about their past than random ghost stories.

Music: Hands down one of the best OST of any drama! It features well known artists such as Gummy, Punch, Chungha, Taeyeon, Ben and even our wonderful IU.

Overall: This drama holds a special place in my heart. Though I can acknowledge the flaws I still looked forward to it every week. My advise would be to not binge it as it might get boring because the episodes are long.

beautifully made
Hotel del Luna is an amazing drama. Although it took me a few episodes to get truly invested in the story, it left me crying like a baby during the last episode.

First of all this drama is just overall very beautifully made. The hotel, the scenery and the outfits (ESPECIALLY IU’s outfits!) are super pretty and pleasing to the eye. This might be one of the most aesthetical kdramas I have ever seen.

Second of all the story is emotional, fun, and investing and the characters are all very likeable. The dynamics between the main leads are great and it‘s fun to see how their relationship changes over time. IU‘s performance really stood out to me, but all the actors did a great job in this one.

Lastly the OST of this drama is amazing and features a lot of popular artists.

Would recommend everyone to watch this kdrama!

Beautiful, but the backstory is what got me
Yes, just to get it out of the way. The cinematography of this drama is just gorgeous, IU rocks every single outfit, and the OST is also pretty great.

In this entire drama, however, I have to say that plotwise I was just so much more invested in MW's backstory and in the enemies-to-lovers ship. I completely fell in love with the flashbacks and the high-stakes dynamics between the characters, even while knowing that everything was going to end in tragedy.

While I still enjoyed the modern story and the unusual dynamic between the main leads, I didn't love them as much as I loved the backstory couple, and I almost didn't feel any romance at all. I think part of this is just the time taken to the modern plot.

I wasn't a huge fan of this kind of episodic writing in Master's Sun and I felt the same for this one. Other than the subplots that connected us directly to the main or supporting cast, I didn't care much for the individual ghosts and their stories and pretty much just waited with bated breath to find out about MW's story.

She was undoubtedly the most interesting and layered character out of everyone, and I wish we had dedicated just as much time to the male lead as we did to her or even to any of the supporting cast (the hotel workers). Even with his backstory, his character and plot seemed a little shallow.

Ultimately, it was the backstory of MW that stole the show, my attention, and my heart.

hotel del luna being one of the most anticipated dramas, i felt like i should give it a shot.
knowing at iu was being a part of the cast made me quite excited, and as expected i couldn't imagine who could play jang manwol better than her.

production wise, this drama is very aesthetically pleasing and definitely worth it's quality. from the interior of the hotel, manwol's outfits and also the cinematography that the drama has delivered is pleasing to the eye and i loved how the whole drama is shot.
plot wise, it wasn't the greatest plot i have encountered but it definitely wasn't bad at all. i enjoyed the character developments of each character, and the connections between the past selves with their the current selves and how fate brought each person together. however, for some reason in the middle of the drama i felt like i could predict jang manwol's back story and what made her receive her punishment.

overall the drama was good! it's worth my time and i loved the chemistry between all the characters in this drama ~

Before binge-watching this, I was really torn between reviews that gave it a perfect 10 and others that find all sorts of problems with its storytelling. But I jumped right in because I love good cinematic experience and I also wanted to check out Jang Man Wol's fantastic wardrobe choices, lol. Safe to say I actually belonged in the group that rated this drama a perfect 10, mainly because I believe binge-watching this helped to ease some of the problems that viewers could nitpick when watching this on a weekly basis. I don't find the individual ghost stories distracting from the actual main story consisting of Jang Man Wol and her ex-lover in the past, because I see that as exactly how the writers and director wanted them to be: to give context to the guests of Hotel del Luna (who are ghosts, but really - human). This way, the storytelling hasn't taken too much a deviation from the whole purpose and theme of what the drama seeks to achieve: 1) to entertain as well as 2) to teach you about the nature of human relationships.

IU was perfectly casted as Jang Man Wol and this was the first drama I have seen her in anything. I read that My Ahjussi was a complicated-torn character for her to play, so I was surprised that the directors and screenwriters only wanted her to play this very sassy and bratty role, which she executed perfectly. Yeo Jin Goo was fantastic in his role as Gu Chan Sung, but I admit that his character wasn't given enough depth and spectrum to be explored and expanded, other than the fact that he's the most perfect guy for Man Wol to finally break free from her centuries-old anger and need for revenge. But then I wasn't really a stickler for this since whatever of Chan Sung's thrown on my face, I don't really find the lack of it take anything much from the main story. Lee Do Hyun who played Man Wol's ex-lover was fantastic as well, and his eyes really express a lot. This is a rookie actor with so much potential to make it big!

As for the BGM, everyone knows that the whole playlist of this drama is so well done and very delicately crafted. My favourites are the songs by Paul Kim and Punch (Done for Me).

Rewatch value is very high because of all the beautiful details and scenes that make this drama so enjoyable to watch.

BEST OF HONG SISTERS!!! RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE IF YOU WANT A GOOD LAUGH AND A GOOD CRY!!!

I've been a huge fan of Hong sisters' dramas and they never disappoint me. First time I heard about their comeback and the casting, i thought I shouldnt miss it. YEO JIN GOO omaygashhh I jus cant move on. He had such a charming character that made girls fall in love with him even more (fight me if I'm wrong). And IU was hilarious despite her bitchy character. I loved her makeup and dresses, she jus always looked so stunning. I cant think of any actress who can fit this character other than IU. You wouldnt want to miss the side stories too, how they were so attached to each other in the end makes me so attached to them too. T.T so hard to say goodbye to this dramaaa!!

I saw a lot of comments that say that this drama was so unrealistic that they couldnt finish it. I'm actually one of those ppl who's not into fantasy and stops watching a drama if it gets cringy, but this drama never made me feel that way. If you start this drama and dont finish it, youre missing one big of a treasure. The story indeed was unrealistic, cmoooonn its fantasy, but look at how every character actually pulled off their roles adn also the life lessons(love, friendship, family etc..) Each of them broke my heart with their stories. (there you gooo, im getting tearyyy lol). I love all of them so much!


After I watched the last episode, I jus really had to share it with my friends and make them watch it. XD and so I'm sharing it here as well cuz I want everyone to watch it. A masterpiece ladies and gentlemen! Also the acting was 100/100!!

Hotel del Luna was presented as an intriguing, somewhat pitiful yet comidic drama, which on its own drew in my attention. And Lee Ji Eun as the main character? Say no more.

Story:
We are set off with Jang Man Wol's story and the beginnning of the existence of the Moon Guest House but are however left as to why this occurs. Later on we are presented with Goo Chan Sung, the child, who because of his father, is tied to Hotel del Luna for the rest of his life. Throughout the development between both characters' relationship, we come across the lighthearted yet somewhat sentimental stories of the ghost guests, building a sense that ghosts are nothing to be afraid of as they were also humans who had died, often leaving regrets behind. The hotel features Mr. Kim (the bartender), a funny and down-to-Earth man, Mrs. Choi (rooms manager) a heartwarming and rational woman and last but not least Ji Hyun Joong (hotel receptionist) an adorable and sentimental guy. You get to know each character and sympathise with their background story and why they hold grudges that make them unable to go to the afterlife. Jang Man Wol's past is shown and built up throughout the entire drama and each time an episode ends it leaves you on a cliffhanger wanting more. I have to say that it would have been nicer if the way she had confronter her grudge/regret would done her past justice. Personally the story that got to me the most was Ji Hyun Joong's.

Acting/Cast:
From the main cast to the cameos, everyone's acting was exceptionally impressing and captivating. After 'My Mister' Lee Ji Eun proved that her acting skills were not simply those of a singer, but could instead be compared to great actor's and actresses'. She perfectly delivers Jang Man Wol's character with all the conflicting memories and emotions she carries. It was my first time seeing Yeo Jin Goo in a drama and I can safely say that I could tell this man had been in the game for a couple of years. Only then I found out that he is 22 years old, which blew my mind completely. He depicts Goo Chan Sung's composed and disciplined character but also manages to make you laugh due to his innocence. I have to add that there was this particular scene in which he broke down into tears; completely heart-wrenching and made me cry like a baby. All the other actors and actresses impressed me beyong expectations, whether I had seen them before or I was seeing them for the first time.

Cinematography/Styling:
I think it's particularly important to point out how amazing the production, camera work and editing was. I was in awe with every single setting and didn't realise how much a particular background or colour scheme could bring out emotions until I saw Hotel Del Luna. Of course, Jang Man Wol's outfits/style was the talk of the town. You could probably count up to 10 outfits and hairstyles in each episode and they were all absolutely beautiful and mood-fitting. So a really big round of applause to all the crew because they really did a great job.

Music:
I don't think I had seen such a powerful OST lineup in a really long time. Not only does the music accompany the scene but in fact makes the scene, it intensified it to an extent beyond imaginable. My personal favourites were All about you (그대라는 시) by Taeyeon and Done For Me by Punch, the latter being absolutely heart-wrenching with that heavy instrumental part in it.

Rewatch value:
I would probably watch this drama again now that it's complete because, believe me, it was a pain to watch it whilst it was airing. Watching all the episodes at once will definitely allow me to maintain the same mood throughout the drama and I will probably enjoy it even more. (I do have to say that sometimes the 1h 30min episodes tired me out a bit and seemed unnecessary long).

In conclusion, would I recommend watching this drama? YES. Nothing else to say, just watch it.

After a full day and a half, I've made my mind about Hotel Del Luna's rating... It's an 8.

Let's make no mistake, this series is good and will most likely be the best drama this year. A complete blueprint of what a fantasy drama should be, full of romance and mystery and world building which excels very much in that regard.

However there were times when I personally thought nothing was happening in the story especially in the middle parts of episodes and would often fast forward to the points where the characters I cared about actually moved their arcs forward, it reminds me of formulaic storytelling were a villain of the week or monster of the week or in this case, ghost of the week happens and all the main characters have to untangle and solve. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this format but in a digital world where we can skip ahead, it kinda takes away from the traditional raw emotions meant to happen.

The series had phenomenal acting and it's star IU continues to shine throughout. YJG also holds his own with what he's given. It's beautifully shot with every frame seemingly from a movie. The soundtrack is ok. Not as memorable as other dramas have had.

Basically this is Goblin-lite with the roles reversed and the actions reversed. You had 900+ year old Goblin waiting for his bride to take the sword out of his heart and end his existence only to end up, falling in love, dying and staying to eventually see the bride of his life move on without him. Here, you have poor weak and naive Gu, the human hotelier falling in love with someone knowing full well the only way she could truly move on is if she left him and he does whats best for her, sacrificing his happiness for hers, sending his last guest off but the key points in both cases are the memories left behind, both leads didn't want to lose the memories and that to me is the most painful thing.

Being reminded everyday for the rest of your life of what truly made you happy and not being able to re-live it or in this case remember it, was never truly an option for our male leads. So they will continue on, living without the other that made them happy. A love like that goes beyond time and existence. It shines eternally without waver and without valour.

Gu becomes the tiger in the painting, looking at a time now lost but a time remembered.

It's not all roses however, there are flaws. I do think Gu's backstory is notoriously weak, almost Mary Sue like. The late reveal at the finale seems like a cop-out for not having any relation prior. I do think if you were rooting for the second lead, you got cheated tremendously. All that build up for not but even more noticeable was in the last few episodes you didn't really see any kisses, just a lot of lingering hugs.

I interpret the ending as its shown. Gu, never taking the meds continues to live his normal life, outside of Korea. Eventually when he does pass on, he sits at a bench and meets Man Wol again in a brand new life but their actual conversation doesn't necessarily mean they just met. Maybe they're already together in that life so happier ending but sad loves are always more memorable.

The supporting cast also had it's moments as well. They had to have more scenes because we'd get bored of the main couple by the fourth episode. It was very much an ensemble and group effort to make this series enjoyable as it was.

I do think as time goes by, this will be remembered as one of the greats. Up there with BBF, YWCFTS, DOTS and Goblin and rightfully so. Also wouldn't it be something if Kim So Hyun's first manager at the Blue Moon was Jun Ji Hyun... :)

And here I thought the hotel industry was boring.

Incredible
Hotel del Luna....

An incredibly good drama. First of all I have to admit that I canceled the series before, wrongly noticed. I'm actually the kind of person who doesn't cry on series or movies, but this series moves even the strongest of people to tears.

The Production of Hotel Del Luna is from another planet. Every single scene was a success and the actors were great. I was surprised to see IU in the role of Jang Man Wol because I didn't know she was in the drama, but as expected she was great.
The whole story is well thought out and very interesting, even if the episodes last for over an hour. The production, as already mentioned, is just breathtaking. From the different locations to the scenes, everything was just perfect.
I really like the music who was played a lot during the drama, it was something special.
The places where the story was played were very well chosen, as were the clothes/costumes.
Jang Man Wol and Goo Chan Sung's relationship is downright sweet, even if there have been ups and downs.
The last episode was just very sad, as the people slowly but surely disappeared into the tunnel and the relatives mourned ...
For me the best thing were the flashbacks because you lernt so much about the people during these.

So please give the drama a try, you won't regret it.

manwol is the only interesting character
The cast list & the guest roles were amazing and acting was superb & despite being one of the most hyped dramas it was so underwhelming , i couldn't bother to watch the side stories (which takes up a lot of the episodes) lol i skipped almost all of it bc it was super unnecessary. ghost hunting and all sheesh who's got the time!

romance between manwol & chansung were Meh , manwol's characteristics was too strong for her to end up with chansung tbh they could've made him someone of her level (of characteristics) because he was so boring to me .. romance seems forced tbh don't really feel it there.

how they resolved manwol's grudge? what the hell was that 3 minutes of standing & looking at eachother? she held on to that grudge for 1300 years just for it to end like that? lol they could've at LEAST made it more dramatic. even the side characters have longer stories on how they resolve their grudges!

overall the best part of this drama is manwol (and her outfits) & the most interesting part is her past with cheongmyung & yeonu . i would've definitely rated this drama higher if they focused more on that. lee dohyun did an amazing job in portraying his character despite being a rookie at that time omg loved it so much. their story was the only one that made me cry lol

i contemplated a lot on whether to drop this drama or not but i didn't because i wanted to see how it all ends but ???? so so underwhelming. could've been so much better

Hotel del Luna is like most fantasy romance dramas we've seen before; so the storyline is predictable. It has the usual funny scenes and the heartwrenching stuff.

What's awesome it that the main leads embody the traits of the opposite gender.
The female lead is a warrior, a leader stuck in time and hating it. She's strong, capable and money-hungry... SHE CRAY.
The male lead is kind, warm-hearted and a do-gooder... HE'S ADORABLE.
In this drama, the woman comes to the rescue of the man... AND HE LOVES IT.
It's worth watching just to see the gender swap and the beautiful relationship between the main characters unfold.

The OST is one of the best EVER. I mean, Taeyeon, Heize, Chung Ha and Gummy?!

Also; IU's wardrobe is to die for.

I rated high on rewatch value because I've already rewatched all episodes :)

This is undoubtedly my favorite kdrama of the year.

Fantastic story line, beautiful cinematography, great acting, amazing casts, full of emotions, and BEST SOUNDTRACKS EVER. Everything just fits perfectly and I couldn't stop sobbing at the last few episodes. But that ending was perfect ESPECIALLY the last 60 secs cameo of the new hotel owner!!

Props to all involved in this drama. Not sure if I'll rewatch since this is a very emotional and long drama BUT I'll keep it in my heart ????

This drama is obviously written by the Hong Sisters and they have written several best hit, but for me personality this drama was the best work up to date in my opinion. To be honest, I was hesitant to start this drama because of the past written works by the Hong Sisters, but this drama change my perception and I decided to give it a try.

There is no main characters other than the leads of course being Lee Ji Eun and Yeo Jin Goo, but many of the side characters is what made the drama shine as well. However, I would suggest reading the plot to see if you are interested and give a tried because base on the plot it seem to be a typical Korean drama that has been done, but this one is different and you won't regret it. There are 16 episodes and each episode there is a meaningful story and guest cameo is well.

Hotel Del Luna is a beautifully told story. Some will say that this show is slow after some point in the middle episodes. It does slow down I will agree with that, but the slowness feels and adds naturally to the story. No, I won't rewatch this because of my tendency of not to rewatch things I've already seen unless it's with someone else. So if I find someone to rewatch this with me, I'll do it but not just by my lonesome.
Story:
The story starts almost abrasively but mellows out which I think leads people to believe it slows. But the story becomes more intense and lays out an intriguing world. By far, one of the most intricate storylines that has a bigger cast but still manages to address each and everyone's back story. From 1,300 to 500 to 200 to 70 years ago. Each story has its own unique feel making each more precious. Death is also a giant theme in this story, no surprise when writing about Grim Reapers, Ghosts, and the like. However, this intense subject matter is shown in all lens of life. With many different perspectives in which to believe.
Acting:
The chemistry between our main leads was one of the things that made this story breathtaking. After watching my fair share of dramas, I can tell you that these two are nothing like any other couple I've encountered. They have cute, funny moments that make you smile or giggle. While also having a very significant outlook on the life they share, if only for a brief time. Jan Man Wol and Ku Chan Sung are an alluring coupling that does nothing but enhances the characters and story told.
IU and Yeo Jin Goo give such power and prowess to these characters. The casting for this lead couple was perfect. I was worried about Yeo Jin Goo because of his recent Absolute Boyfriend series which I didn't like and barely finished. But this was so a much better fit. He did a heartfelt job when portraying Ku Chan Sung — as for IU, even more, impressing that her precious works. She tends to get sweeter and better the more she acts. By far the most dazzling character, Jan Man Wol's outfits were over the top.
As for the rest of the cast, Shin Jung Keun who plays Mr. Kim was a crane who put just the right amount of funny into each moment as well as having some tearful moments. Bae Hae Seon as Ms. Choi felt at first like a very flat character, and it wasn't until almost the very end that she grew. I hoped for more, but I think this was just the right amount. Plus that hug, tearjerker. Pyo Ji Hoon as Ji Hyun Joong surprised me; I honestly loved his character way more than I had thought, and his character development towards the end was astonishing as well as it just felt right. Not like a last-minute addition but a natural arch. Kang Mi Na as Kim Yu Na fit perfectly with Ji Hyun Joong. I loved how we experienced love in it's purest form, first love.
Music:
The music most definitely sets the mood in each of the scenes it was assigned. It loved that IU even sang a song wishing for Man Wol and Chan Sung to have a happy ending. They used powerhouse singers like Ben, Gummy, Taeyeon, and Punch, to name a few. The songs are so sad, touching and powerful that sometimes they took over. But I was grateful because then I couldn't hear myself sobbing. I honestly can say this collection of songs will stick with me even if I forget the story which is unlikely to happen.
Hotel Del Luna is by far one of my favorites of this year and maybe even my drama watching career. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

In myth-fantasy K Dramas, it is often seen that only the male characters lead a tired and bored immortal life either by being a God or by suffering for his past sins. This trope has been successfully reversed in Hotel Del Luna.

Written by the Hong Sisters, Hotel Del Luna follows the story of Man Wol, a 1300 year old soul punished into roaming the human world for her past sins. Her time has been paused by the Gods by denying her entry into the afterlife, and connected to Hotel Del Luna and its Moon Tree - a moving hotel which transforms its ownership to a soul which has committed the worst of sins and still holds grudges. This hotel serves as a platform for fulfilling the unfulfilled desires of dead humans, before they can move to the afterlife. This is a stark comparison considering how Man Wol has to constantly send off her guests to the afterlife, while she is herself denied entry into the same.

Del Luna's Man Wol is hot tempered, narcissistic, tired of her long existence, pursues a rich lifestyle even while being constantly bankrupt, enjoys Champagne and caviar, and a clear foodie - all her food pictures go on her Instagram account, loves shopping and buys a lot of cars. Throughout the series, Man Wol remains true to her individualistic character traits, she nurtures her revenge, her grudges against the enemies and even acts on fulfilling them. She is portrayed to be strong - she is the one saving her love interest from supernatural elements, brave with thoughts and actions of her own, she knows what she is doing. She doesn't simply turn into an obedient, loving soul in a second upon meeting her human love interest, as is often shown in most of K Dramas.

Apart from Man Wol and her narrative, the small subplots this series follows are equally entertaining. Special mention to the quirky, funny and equally endearing side characters of the show with plenty stories to tell of their own. The show's cinematography and CGI effects are so very beautiful, the stark Moon Tree, the blooming flowers, making it a treat to watch it.

I love a good romance spiced with ghosts and mystery!
Hotel Del Luna is one of the first dramas in a long time that has been able to pull a strong emotional reaction out of me. I have seen a lot of good, emotionally impressive dramas before, but it's been a long time since I last saw a drama like that before watching Hotel Del Luna.

The story of Hotel Del Luna is very interesting, and I was very intrigued by it right from the start. I personally really like dramas that handle the topic of ghosts, for example ""Master's Sun"" and ""Oh My Ghostess"" are some of my favourite dramas of all time. The story overall was good and interesting, but in my opinion it was a little draggy/messy/confusing at some points, which is why I scored the story 8.5. There was a lot of mystery in this drama, and I would have hoped that the mysteries could have been solved a bit more evenly during the drama. Also, there were a lot of scenes, where they used like 7 different camera angles just to show Man Whol (IU) sitting on a chair or lying under a tree for like 3 minutes straight for example, and I found that a bit unnecessary lol.

The cast of HDL was amazing. The main leads did a really good job, and all the supporting actors were amazing as well. I especially want to give a ""shoutout"" to Block B's P.O. aka Pyo Jihoon, I was very pleasantly surprised by his acting and I absolutely loved his character. I actually loved all of the characters that were the main hotel staff, they were so great. The only thing about the casting that I found odd, was that why on Earth was one of the ghost actresses dubbed?? I have no clue.

The music in this drama was good, I mean nothing was mindblowingly good or extremely memorable, but I didn't think any of the songs were particularly bad either. Just some quite standard drama OST songs. ""Another Day"" by Punch & Monday Kiz, ""Done for Me"" by Punch, ""Can You Hear My Heart"" by Heize and ""Only You"" by Yang Da Il were probably my favourites.

I personally never rewatch dramas anymore, but I honestly feel like this one could be entertaining to watch again some day, but not right away though. Maybe if I get my spouse to watch some dramas with me, this could be on our watchlist :D

Overall I scored this drama a solid 9. I liked the plot, I liked the cast, and even though there were some moments/people in this drama that I really disliked, (like Man Whol's personality at some points,) they didn't overshadow this drama's greatness. I would happily recommend Hotel Del Luna to anyone, especially if you like supernatural dramas with a good dose of romance and mystery (:

ONE OF THE BEST FANTASIES!! GREAT WORK HERE!! ALERT OF MASTERPIECE!!
This was pretty much ➡️ AMAZING!

Great chemistry between both leads and the storyline has a development (this is almost impossible to find in almost any drama nowadays, everything is too repetitive and dull now).
The storyline goes back and forth between the past (from her POV) to the present. It centers mainly in the romance, the fantasy theme such us, helping ghost cross to the other side by letting go of their grudges, the mystery of the past story with her past lover and the also death (as she wants to die but she can't).
The characters are well constructed, my favourite is her (IU's character) her sassy personality and her toughness are different and difficult to see in korean women.
The male character is well made too with personal development/growth, his experiences teach him something that will make better in each episode.
The supporting cast was easily enjoyable too with the funny touch, I really loved their addition to the drama too.
The OST were beautiful and easy to the ears, just like the drama.
I really enjoyed watching this drama from the beginning till the end. I highly recommend it, you'll not regret and have a great time watching it.
RATE 9.5/10

Strong fantasy set-up and dynamic between leads with ultimately unsatisfying conclusion
I came into Hotel del Luna with several biases, but I enjoyed it for the most part (except for the ending, which I really found unsatisfying). Usually, the fantasy tag is an automatic skip when I'm looking for prospective dramas, since I think the extra layer of contrivance often sets up ridiculous plotting and a lot of fat a show could trim off. I didn't find this to be the case with Hotel del Luna, overall. I'm also not a fan of frequent flashbacks, which this has, but here it makes sense given the nature of the fantasy and the premise. The way they're interlaid into dreams makes sense and so the majority of the setup in the beginning and middle is pretty artful. More superficially, I think the costuming and set design was a definite aesthetic draw - it reminds me a lot of It's Okay to Not Be Okay in how it's used as a supplemental pleasure to the main drama. The music is also nice throughout. Overall, there's a lot of visual and auditory appeal in this.

(General spoiler) I really like IU, as most going into this probably do. She does a great job, as does the ML; they have strong on-screen chemistry and their characters' dynamic works well. I do wish their romance was more intimate, though; much of their relationship is threaded through teasing banter, on the one hand, and long-term promises and commitments on the other. As the conclusion was coming up, I felt like the reality of the romance (indicated by the former) faded for the sake of the fantasy-driven resolution (the latter). They flirt but their relationship is weirdly desexualized because IU's character is somehow a 1,300 prude when the chips are down and the ML shows even sarcastic interest. Usually, I think shows can verge too far towards fluffy/intimate, but here I felt like the weight of their choices actually called for the sex/marriage institutionalization more than so many lighthearted shows I've seen that pursue that direction. She kisses him like 3 episodes in - or so it seemed - but that's basically the extent of their romantic intimacy besides some nice chaste hugging. Instead, we get extremely heavy romantic statements of commitment at the expense of fluffiness. Though I typically don't find it necessary (or even desirable to include it), I think having sex and more moments of intimacy in this show could've better shaped the drama at the end and added more levity as well (I think of how that would've fit within the pseudo-gossip the hotel workers had between them). In short, I think the desire to be true to the show's fantasy premise overwhelmed the desire to have a satisfying romance (with all the attendant intimacy), which is ultimately why the ending didn't work for me at all.

(Spoiler) Halfway through, my rating probably would've been closer to an 8.5 or a 9, but the ending made me rethink the parts of the show that I enjoyed from the beginning and middle. My central question throughout the run was, ""are they going to be able to stay together in the real world?"" But as I got to the end, the creators clearly thought more in terms of ""what's the right way for IU's character to atone and thus for us to wrap up the fantasy side of things?"" As someone who watched primarily for the romance, the ending was very unfulfilling and frankly didn't make sense to me, especially the ML's actions and what he says to the FL about moving on. I think having reincarnation as a facet of this drama was a fundamental mistake, though one the creators relied a lot on for conflict in the middle and end. Rather, I think the drama of losing immortality and reintegrating into society while dealing with lingering grudges would've been more compelling narrative. I don't think fated relationships - something established in this show via reincarnation - have any real stakes or emotional fulfillment (because choice is circumscribed by destiny), so having the resolution based on some nebulous possibility of meeting again in a reincarnated future does nothing for me. Here, they overcome and change in substantial ways only to lose what's most meaningful to them. Ultimately, the fantasy side of this drama, which I didn't mind for most of the run, led to this kind of unfulfilling conclusion (and on a shameless cameo no less). Like the show's creators, in the end, the main characters are more concerned with an imagined future than with the material reality of living and cultivating romance out of tragic circumstances.

(Spoiler) Rather than romantic or cute, I found the ending to be a weird mix of cynicism and idealism emerging out of the religiously-inflected fantasy. IU's character never lived a real life, never got to be someone because her life was conditioned by the cruel machinations of fate and the stain of vengeance. Once she meets someone with whom she can live and be free, she has to say goodbye because a gaggle of mercurial Fate bitches basically say so. In such a case, it's not clear what the ML should do in his regular life afterward. He falls in love with a gorgeous millennium-old demigod who he makes eternal promises to, but after she moves on, he's supposed to just live basically a regular life? His whole existence at that point is conditioned by the knowledge that his deepest happiness is contingent upon dying and meeting someone he won't remember in a reality he can't fathom. That's not the leap of faith that makes a good romance, but a religious deferral and rejection of the joy of living. The structure of the show really made me think the ending was a punishment of the FL (and the ML by extension), rather than the struggle to move on from her grudge (as it's presented). So the problem, to me, wasn't that the ending is sad (which it is), but that the basis for the resolution - reincarnated future hope - is nonsense and unfulfilling.

WOW I was SO pleasantly surprised by this quirky, emotional, heartfelt, and CUTE show!

After admiring the ultimate puppy-dog-of-the-Korean-Industry Yeo Jin Goo in Beyond Evil, I IMMEDIATELY started watching Hotel Del Luna because I was SO DAMN EXCITED to see him in a cute romantic show.

I just wanted to see him be cute and in love and act cutely with a girl and act like he was in love and smile and giggle and be sexy and hot and funny and HE WAS ALL THAT AND MUCH MORE IN THIS SHOW!
He was absolutely adorable and the PERFECT companion to the cute little firecracker that IU was throughout, they compliment each other SO perfectly, and one thing I kept noticing was the difference in their hand sizes! Yeo Jin Goo has giant hands, specially when compared to IU's tiny ones, and I absolutely ADORED every scene which showed them hugging/holding hands etc. etc.

The ghost stories of all the guests at their hotel kept me engaged and interested and emotional. The staff all had compelling back-stories, enough to fuel me to cheer for their happy ending as well.

And another special thing about this show is that I usually end up skipping elaborate backstories of any character, specially if it relates to the Joseon Era, but for this show I saw every second of their pasts, and not just IU's, but also the staff had an unique stories and were extremely interesting to watch!

The only two people I didn't care much for were the receptionist and his girlfriend, although the little sister of the receptionist was ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE.

The fantasy element in the show was beautiful and stunning, with an extremely memorable soundtrack to boot, beautiful songs and OST. Also all the cameos were such a pleasant surprise.

In short, this show was like a hidden treasure for me, and I extremely enjoyed every element of it.

This is a great drama, I don't believe in overpraising undeserving dramas so being honest this isn't one of the best dramas I've seen but it is a far throw from the worst too. Like every show, there are some good points as well as some bad.

The good: 1. Visuals- Two great-looking leads and IU's wardrobe deserve praise. 2. Atmosphere-cinematography, soundtrack, eerie/fairy tale feeling. This show definitely had a unique look. 3. The Cameo- I just need to stress this.The effects are top notch, the scenery and costumes are amazing- they've really spared no expense and you feel it in almost every shot.

The Bad: Story development-if I were to draw a line graph of the plot progression, it would be flat and stagnant. It's not a heavy drama. I don't think it was trying to be; at the same time, it was not engaging to watch because it lacked eventful moments. Almost every episode they show a ghost and the story behind their death. It felt too formulaic, predictable, and honestly...boring. I wanted them to elaborate on IU's story more and her relationship with the male lead. I liked the flashbacks, but the writers didn't utilize them to their full potential. A lot of the script didn't make sense to me. It seemed like they were trying to come up with deep dialogue, but it was sometimes confusing because they kept adding new information about ghosts and the spirit world, so it ended up sounding like they were making everything up as they go with no clear direction.

Overall, if you ignore the story development issues, this drama is really a sweet, original and humorous drama with a great cast that should definitely be given a chance.

This Drama is Overrated
This review will be short.

I liked the cinematography...really beautiful
The 2 OSTs by PUNCH were incredible
The cameo at the end - damn fantastic
Jung Mal Wol was quirky and not your typical FL - that was interesting to watch

That's it for me.

Even the great acting by the 2 leads could not save a lackluster plot. This drama is totally overrated.

The episodes were soooo long and they dragged and dragged. I just hate the fact that I can't not finish a drama once I am a few episodes in. That and my respect for IU as an actress were the only reasons I made it to the end.

Very underwhelmed by the story but FL is the only one that saves the show.
I love Man-wol but I think there is just too much talking about the past without showing us what happened in the past. There’s a lot of talking and less doing. The ghost of the day and the killer seems like a distraction/filler from the main story. There is like 2 episodes between midway and ending which was good but other than that, everything was slow.

A little predictable which is expected from Korean dramas. There is so much budget in the production but I can tell that there is a lot of CGI. It is really hard for me to immerse myself into that world since everything seems so fake.

There isn’t enough chemistry between the leads. The male lead seems too stiff and one dimensional. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if they have chosen another male lead.

I feel so much more for the second lead that waited for 1000 years by her side, loving her. He risked his life, his pride just to save her. And even waiting 1000 years, he is willing to be happy for her falling in love with someone that is not him.

OST is amazing!! It just captures the right emotions at the right moment. Directing is amazing as well.

I'm just a bit underwhelmed with the ending and the whole show. Everything was slow but the only saving grace is Man Wol.

Grudges, Ghost, Friendships, Family, Laughs, Sadness, Past and Present
I like to watch things that have ghosts or mystical story's for Halloween and I am happy that I watched this drama! It didn't disappoint, it had everything that I love in a drama. It had friendships, relationship, family, comedy, sadness. One minutes I could be sad and the next smiling and laughing at what was being said or done. Yes it has ghosts and one or two may of been a little scary but for the most part when you meet the ghost you found out more about them and their background which didn't make them as scary. The story revolved around things that happened and in the past, grudges and working through your grudges to forgiveness or moving on, with your life. It even had romance in it which was sweet, and the ending had me sad but that is what the story was about moving on to the afterlife, once you are ready!

A 1300 Year Old Cycle.
My review comes three years late after finally getting a chance to rewatch it.
I had followed the drama while it was airing and remember losing interest half way, watching the final episode and skipping through the scenes around Episode 11 - 14. It was this rewatch that finally made me understand why I found certain parts less than interesting.

A young prodigious man is tricked into the service of a supernatural being, Jang Man Weol, after his father was conned into making a deal with her 20 years ago.

Then, we get to see an exclusively detailed view of how Gu Chang Sung's entire life gets turned upside down as a result. I admit, he was an unsuspecting and unconventional male lead --- half of the drama, he is stuck in a state of constant dilemma, attempting to make decisions and also learn about his mysterious master, Jang Man Weol, the owner of Hotel del Luna where he is forced to work.
Jang Man Weol had a lot of ""pecadillos"" rather than being a genuinely evil being. But, I consider her very first decision of tricking Chang Sung's dad into selling his son to her the most cruel one. Burdened with the punishment of running the Hotel for 1300 years, she awaits to serve vengeance to the ones who had forced her through this dark path. It is now upto Chang Sung to see that she crosses the afterlife safely and remove her resentment.

I loved the three ghosts who served the hotel -- Miss Choi, Mr. Kim and Hong Joon. They were humourous. I also adored the rapport between Chang Sung, Sanchez and Mi Ra. I sometimes wished that the story focussed more on the humans than the ghosts. The ghosts whose tales were prominently followed were all emotionally depressing. I did not find them boring, as each one had a pivotal role in changing Man Weol's view on life.

The major events in the story are pre-planned by the 'deities'. And everyone of them managed to get on my nerves except for Police woman Ma Go and Medicine Ma Go. The way they dealt with the lives of living beings like cards was difficult to watch.

Last, but not the least... I could feel why Jang Man Weol sought revenge for centuries. This was also the weakest point in the drama for me. The backstory of a very important character was almost laughable. It was a moment that I waited for as I wished that it would make me find him redeemable, but in the end, he sounded like a coward.
I suddenly understand why Chang Sung was the male lead instead of him. He might not have anything heroic happening around him, but he definitely had enough intellect and loyalty in him.

I wonder how hard it was for IU to act as Jang Man Weol. She had around more than three outfits per episode and I can't imagine how exhausting it was for her and the stylists of this show. (I loved JMW's style though!)

The soundtrack of this drama is absolutely unforgettable. I can remember almost all the songs even after three years.

I do find the drama absolutely delightful and enjoyable. It's not a masterpiece, but the brilliant performances by the cast, beautifully shot scenes and a story that completes a satisfying circle is definitely worth giving a try.

Hotel Del Luna - A Five Star Experience
I started watching this show as something to pass time whilst writing an essay but it quickly grabbed my attention and ensured it would never leave my memory. The concept of the story is very unique and it was really interesting seeing how the show addressed themes of guilt, forgiveness, redemption and death by making some of the main characters fallible to mistakes. The story progressed and though the first five or six episodes were certainly enjoyable, they were more about building chemistry between characters with those ""ghost of the week"" episodes and giving us snippets of Jang Man-Wol's past. But once we reached episode 8, everything after that was really just 10/10 episodes. I found the last scenes of the finale very difficult to watch to the point where I'll revisit the entire show but never rewatch that final episode.

It also became clear by the end that the show was telling us this very crucial message: death isn't the end but merely one stage of someone's life. Separation by death doesn't diminish the value of love and relationships, but makes living through those moments all the more special knowing that they are finite moments that can end at any point. This isn't an easy thing to make peace with for a lot of people, but Hotel Del Luna beautifully crafts the message that often the journey can be as beautiful as the destination. Things come to an end but can last forever if they're moments that are lived well.

What I really like about this show is that the overarching arc of the story doesn't reach its resolution until very well near the end, with an incredible amount of tension generated along the way, but it also gives what some might call the ""calm after the storm"". The pacing isn't quick but I feel it's better this way. Understanding Jang Man-Wol's history over a number of episodes rather than too quickly early on protects the intrigue around her. It is also reflective of how we come to understand new people in our lives as real human beings. Hotel Del Luna, in that sense, is truthful to the human experience of fraternity and relationships.

I also really think there's a particular episode near the end that deserves an article of its own. It was one of the best episodes I've watched in a Kdrama show. It also mattered, after so much deliberating and agonising, that Jang Man-Wol came to the decision that she did during that episode. It was important that the writers had gone with it how they did because it ascribed agency and emotional weight to the significance of her decision, rather than a situation where her choices were resolved for her by the truth being revealed to her. That would have made her angst redundant and wouldn't have been ultimately Jang Man-Wol making a choice but it being made for her. The writers were conveying quite clearly to us that this was both her decision and also their way of answering a question that would have been forming both within the heads of the characters and the audience itself from the show's beginning once Jang Man-Wol's backstory became increasingly revealed.

The stories of the support cast are also quite devastating in their own rights. Really, this is one of those kinds of shows.

The acting is extraordinary in reflecting the show's main themes, and I mean genuinely extraordinary. IU is stunning and steals the show in every scene of every episode. Her character is genuinely one of the most memorable characters I've ever watched in TV. Even if you find the show difficult to enjoy, it's difficult to not appreciate just how good she was. Yeo Jin-Goo was also really good as the lead male in the show, and his character had a really good compassionate aura that contrasted well with IU's character. His morally steadfast approach could appear boring once you realised there was no room for growth seeing as he already began as this perfect, loving guy, but it made him the perfect riposte for IU's character. Whenever the two shared a screen, the show never lacked for it. They enjoyed an incredible chemistry that will live long in the memory and made those final scenes all the more beautiful.

The music. Just wow. Find me a better OST from any show, I'll wait! They enriched the tone of just about every scene, complementing perfectly. There are particular highlights from Episodes 6, 9, 12 and 14 that stand out for helping deepen the beauty of some stirring and moving scenes. They were nearly as memorable as the characters of the show themselves.

Can I just reiterate again how marvellous IU was? She might have inspired a new generation in fashion.

All in all, this is one of the best k-dramas I've ever watched, with a finale that will remain glued to your brain for a very long time afterwards.

Beautiful to watch
This is a beautiful show to watch. Beautiful cast, beautiful set, beautifully filmed, etc. I was impressed by IU's progression throughout the show. I really hated her at the beginning (as I was supposed to), but her character really progressed and you could really see her pain and her vulnerability. Yeo Jin Goo was very good at the reluctant hotel manager. There was a sweet romance, but this spoke more to me about resolving issues in our lives, and the fact that family doesn't have to be nuclear. The hotel staff had their own lovely family.

I thought the special effects were very good and added to the enjoyment of the show.

The costuming of IU was the standout for me. Her clothes and her jewelry were always so stunning and classy. I've watched some other K-dramas recently and have compared the feeling of the clothes/cinematography to Hotel Del Luna. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!

Add the cameo appearances of Lee Joon Gi and Kim Soo Hyun - bonus!

A Must Watch of 2019
Before Hotel Del Luna can be called a ""romance"", it is first and foremost a drama about existing. HDL tells stories of our hotel guests' plight towards their own ends while shining a light on social issues, our faith, humanity, and humanity's inability to concretely define right from wrong.

The central core to HDL is our anti-heroine President Jang Man Wol, owner of HDL. She is as much the owner of this seemingly grand hotel for ghosts as she is an equally trapped prisoner of her own memory.
I enjoyed how the ghost's stories unravelling in each episode somehow tied to JMW's storyline, and what she learns each incidence propels her towards a new choice in her own life.

IU is evidently the star of the show as the script focuses ENTIRELY on building her character and oh boy... she does not disappoint. IU delivered a beyond stellar performance. Her styling, layered facial expressions, tone of voice... I could write an entire essay about how delicately complicated her portrayal of JMW was, I digress, she is genius here. She also opened up an instagram account for JMW as an interactive way to connect with viewers. It was fun seeing her insta posts align with what was happening in the drama each week.
I LOVED Goo Chan Sung and JMW's chemistry. Their actions and words are vital in their relationship and so powerful to them. This drama won't be for you if you're looking for a giddy, sizzling, or somewhat cheesy romance. The writers paid attention not to conform to predictable romantic tropes and antics. Their relationship is much more mature, rooted in real compassion for each other as humans.

The drama has no plot holes, isn't draggy either but well-paced for its theme of forgiveness and proper farewells. I felt so at peace with how this drama ended.

I highly recommend this drama if you like stories about human life, forgiveness, revenge and redemption with a supernatural element. The cinematography, CG, acting, and OSTs are perfection. HDL is a very touching story and a treasure in execution.

Have you ever heard of a hotel that has guests as customers? That's not really common. Hotel del Luna is about a hotel that serves ghosts- yes you heard it right.
It's more than just the ghosts though. There are also life lessons. Overall: the aesthetics, the outfits especially Jang Manweol's outfits are amazing. The OSTs are really good as well as the actors. This is a great watch if you're looking for something new and unique. This drama lets you feel many emotions and you will be surely surprised along the way. This is definitely a drama worth watching.

For me, Hotel del Luna really moved me. It got inside my heart, it went straight to my feelings.

The cinematography in this drama is just marvelous, the cast is perfect and the soundtrack is really beautiful and it's played in the right moments, letting you feel every emotion when it's needed. The flashbacks in this drama are so beautifully made, too, they did an amazing job transporting you to the character's memories.

This is THE drama. It's THAT drama you won't ever forget, and personally I will definitely watch it again someday whenever I feel like I can listen to it's OST again without crying, lol.

Let me say the characters are unique. Even though the most developed character is Man Wol (since she's the main character) we get to see a little about every other people staying and working in Hotel Del Luna and their stories are unique too. The plot is really different from what we've seen related to ghosts and I really appreciated that, since every episode you'll learn something new about Hotel Del Luna and its guests, and how the world of the dead works. This is a really interesting drama and deserves a watch.

A story about healing, moving on, forgiveness, and loving again
n.b.: Might contain what others consider as ""spoiler"" but is not in my opinion.

-------

At first, one would assume this is a typical romantic comedy about some couple who found each other, denies being in loved, and eventually lived happily ever after. However, one will soon learn that this is a story about healing, moving on, forgiveness, and loving again.

IU, as Jang Man Weol the owner of Hotel del Luna, beautifully brought to life her character. She successfully hid her image as the world's ""Queen of Pop"" with her superb acting. From a very friendly, approachable, smiling IU, she totally became the bitter, easy to anger, and strict that is Jang Man Weol. As this story spans a thousand years, IU's talent in acting shone as she took on different roles and genres in one series.

One would probably also assume that Hotel del Luna was an IU show especially since she wore countless of dresses in every 1.5-hour episode, which could range from a thousand years ago to the present. I would say she probably beaten Lucy Liu in Elementary in this area, turning a series into a subtle fashion show. However, Yeo Jin Goo made this his own show as well, himself a veteran actor who have taken challenging roles, playing as Goo Chan Sung, the Hotel Manager, equalised the show between the two actors and their characters.

The music were also great. Yeo Jin Goo's and IU's acting were more than enough but with the right music at the right time, it deepened the emotional connection to the important scenes. From action to the most heart-wrenching scenes, the music made the series very memorable and touching, especially for those who are going through the same challenges in their lives.

The writers also did well. While Hotel del Luna was a hotel for ghosts/spirits, nothing was too scary, I wouldn't even categorised this show as ""horror"". In each episode, they touched on different subjects about death, murder, accidents, forgiveness, and separation with the people we love, that longing desire to be with them even after life has ended. They carefully guided the show to not turn into ""horror""--which amateur writers would've fallen into and throw the story everywhere--by always bringing in the light-hearted comedy of Yeo Jin Goo and IU.

Finally, the overall story of healing, moving on, forgiveness, and loving again was told perfectly in 16 episodes averaging 1 hour and 20 minutes each. This was very eye-opening for those of us who were recently deeply broken, those of us who are denying we have lingering bitterness in our hearts, those of us who are finding it hard to forgive and move on. Goo Chan Sung and Jang Man Wol showed us how and why we should heal, move on, forgive, and love again. Goo Chan Sung demonstrated to us how we should let someone heal first before entering into a relationship with them, how we can be the support they need and not give in to their every demands just because they were deeply hurt. While Jang Man Wol told us how bitterness and an unforgiving heart can lead one to live a sad, unfulfilling, pointless life, and how we can once again love by healing ourselves first.

Thank you to the whole team for bringing us an amazing production and a great meaningful story.

If there will ever be a ""Hotel Blue Moon"", I hope that it will tell meaningful stories as with Hotel del Luna, and that the sequel wouldn't fall into ""just another entertainment show""--a common pitfall with sequels.

Hotel del Luna: 100 out of 10 stars!

A Fantasy Drama with Impressive Story and Cinematography
It is very evident from episode one that this is a Lee Ji Eun drama. As I mentioned earlier, I have never seen her previous dramas. But during the first few minutes of Hotel Del Luna, I was captivated by how she portrayed the moody, greedy, and funny Jang Man Wol. I found myself laughing whenever she tries out food or jewelries, or when trying to justify her reasons for getting a new car. It made me look forward to seeing the other dramas she starred in. A few singers and idols have been dabbling into acting recently, some have transitioned from being an idol to an actress and has gained massive popularity for their immense skills. Take note of Kim Yu Jin or Uie, a former idol and member of the group After School. The dramas she starred in always end with high ratings and has earned her numerous accolades. Like Uie, Ji Eun is also a singer and a talented songwriter known by her stage name IU. Hotel Del Luna has cemented her as a skilled actress.

I know people might call me an ancient or old-fashioned, but this is my first time to see a Korean drama with an impressive cinematography and use of CG effects. Is this the new trend in K-Dramas? I was actually looking forward to seeing one in the upcoming series ‘SF8’, but watching Hotel Del Luna had set my expectations higher. The stunning cinematography really compliments the dark/fantasy genre of the drama, even the colors were well-chosen, from hotel’s walls to Man Wol’s garish clothing.

Overall, Hotel Del Luna is South Korea’s most popular drama of 2019 and it’s a no-brainer. It is a drama that breaks away from the typical romantic comedy genres which in my opinion has saturated the Korean drama industry. A drama that deals with death and the unseen world, it also deals with justice, healing and forgiving which are good values. For me shows that one who have been wronged will always get the justice he deserves. But sometimes in order to achieve justice, one should let go of all his grudges and learn to forgive so he can be fully healed and be free. Overall, it’s a must-see drama with great story, great visuals, and great cast.

The part of kdrama I hate most is the romance scenes. For me, those scenes waste time a lot when they make them appear frequently. Sometimes, it takes 2 minutes per scene and I can't help but skip it. Don't get me wrong, I love romance drama. But when the scenes are too much, it will be like you put too much sugar into your milk.

However, Hotel Del Luna is different.
It's not only romance but also comedy between the two lovers. At first, I expected the scenes would be so long and was ready to skip them. BUT! As soon as I had a thought about it, they put the twist. Rather than putting kissing scenes, they made some jokes in those scenes and thus became comedy.

The story itself represents so many real-life and social problems. They did well in criticizing modern social life.
I've watched 3 latest IU's dramas and her character + acting are so gooooo0000d.

i loved every second of this show
i didn't come on here with the intent of writing a review but after seeing a lot of reviews saying that they were disappointed, i wanted to give a more positive perspective because i loved this show and i don't want anyone who might love it as much as i did to miss out on it.

i don't doubt that there might be problems with the show on a critical/technical level, but i was so immersed in the story, the tone, and especially the characters that any of those problems completely went over my head.

the characters are really what carried the show for me. i don't know if it was the writing or the actors or something else, but i was convinced of every emotion the characters felt and their actions never seemed out of place. pretty much every problem in this show is something no one has ever experienced and yet i was still able to empathize with and relate to them. i don't think i've ever cried over a show as much as i did with this one.

an aspect of this show i really enjoyed was the escapism, which doesn't sound like something that's worthy of praise, but i think it was a very deliberate part of the show and it was so well. it's not so fantastical that you're detached, but it's separated from reality enough that you can forget about the real world and become immersed in a new and lively one.

i guess i should comment on the music, but there wasn't anything about it that stood out to me. the ost fit the show and it sounded nice without being distracting. i'm not big into k-dramas so i don't really know what to expect from osts so maybe don't listen to me lol i also haven't attempted to rewatch it so i can't comment on that either

usually i have trouble getting invested in tv shows, but this show never failed to put me in a good mood. i never felt frustrated or annoyed by the characters' bad decisions because they always felt understandable. even with shows i love, i consider not finishing, but this show kept me wanting more. clearly this show isn't for everyone, but there's nothing about this show that i dislike at all. i'm not sure what the other reviewers expected, but if you're expecting something groundbreaking or deep then you will probably be disappointed. if you like shows that are cheesy and angsty and you don't need them to have a ""deeper meaning"", then you will probably enjoy this.

Honestly I didn’t think I would write about it, but I think I have to. I saw many diferent reviews: some say that this drama is overrated, others say that is one of the best kdramas ever. Well I didn’t see enough kdramas to say if it’s one of the best kdramas ever or not, but certainly became one of my favourite ones.
This drama has so many lessons about life, death, revenge, love, hate and forgiveness that really touched me. In my opinion the plot and the story line were very good and the characters evolution throughout the drama was amazing, both main and secondary characters.
Also, I never saw a drama with IU before and I loved her! Her acting is fantastic. The romance between the main leads is very cute and I really liked their chemistry.
The OST is an important part of the drama and Hotel del Luna’s OST is a masterpiece, the musics are really good and they just fit perfectly in every moments.
They made me laugh, made me cry, and now I miss them very much!

Such a beautiful show
Okay so I’ve come here to write this before I finish the last episode(don’t know why it took me so long to watch this as it’s got a very high rating) because I ain’t mentally prepared for the inevitable to happen the scene of man wol leaving with koo Chang sun seeing her off so I just want to talk about how amazing this show is

Story:
The story and concept to me is great as I’m relatively new to k-dramas I don’t know if it’s a played out concept or original but I love it, the idea there is something after death is a beautiful thing and I feel like a lot of people that watch this can find comfort even know it is fantasy in watching this.It is a very emotional show usually I’m not really getting watery eyed until the end but with this because every episode there is a different story of someone that has passed it started from the beginning the stories In particular I shed a few tears at was the couple the were going to get married and go to the afterlife together, the doctor and his wife trying to prolong there sons life by giving them there lifeline,Sanchez losing his girlfriend Veronica was very emotional too.I also enjoyed how the story of man wols past it intertwined throughout the whole show with yeon u and the general.The whole way through the show they have eluded that man wol will have to go and I’ve known this but I’m not ready for it it’s going to be heartbreaking.


Cast/characters
Main star of the show is 100% IU-man wol she’s hilarious and sweet and a more forward confident sort of female lead which is definitely how i prefer female leads in k dramas in the majority of the shows there shy with there emotions,beat around the bush too much or are just awkward with people they clearly like not with man wol she knows what she wants she’s self confident,stubborn and expresses her feelings full on similar examples of this in shows I think are great are go moon young from it’s okay not to be okay and shin Hye sun from angel:last mission love.
Koo Chang sun is great too his chemistry with man wol made laugh a lot of the time and there great together.
All of the hotel staff are great too the bell boy in particular I liked.

In conclusion I loved pretty much everything about this drama only thing I wish would change is probably man wol and Chang sun being together at the end but the story is about death and the afterlife so I suppose it would undermine the whole theme of the show
Watch it if you haven’t already you will enjoy it!

Yo! this show is fantastic, the plot is very creative and the way they develop the characters is nice. I absolutely enjoy every single ep ! and cry a lot- my favorite show so far is Goblin, and this one is getting close to winning. I def recommend watching it. The acting is also very very good, totally believable even though it's fake. all characters are likable which is something I haven't experienced yet. The music is a bit too mellow for me, but I already have a song that whenever it comes up I find myself singing along ( or trying ).

This drama has a really special place in my heart. I recommend people to watch it because trust me you will love it as much as I do. It's a 10/10. The way that IU plays her character has brought me joy and tears, this whole drama is just too beautiful not to watch and cry over. I really want these series to have a second season (S2) please. I really love everything about this drama and how Goo Chan puts his life into not having Man Wol from vanishing into ashes and that's the saddest and yet lovely thing to see because he really cares and loves her just as much as she loves and cares for him. I hope that they have a happy ending to their life and get a chance to love and live and die and make happy memories with one another.

STORY: The overall story wasn't really original. It's about afterlife, reincarnation, deities and supernatural. Which is not lacking in the Korean drama world which is the reason why I am giving an 8/10 for the plot. It also not a lighthearted drama because I cried my heart out especially on the last 2-3 episodes, so if you are looking for a feel good drama this is not for you.
ACTING/CAST: I should be honest, one of the biggest reason I wanted to watch this drama was mainly because of IU. However, I loved PO and Mina in it. Mina is really pretty. Also, Yeo Jin Goo was an eye candy. I might as well say that Yeo Jin Goo's acting is 100/100. I can really feel the emotions coming from him it made my heart ache together with him.
MUSIC: The best part of this drama is the music. Hands down! 10/10. Constant replay on my list. Gummy, Taeyon, Punch, Monday Kiz you name it!
REWATCH VALUE: As I mentioned, this is not a feel good drama. If you wanted to watch something happy this is not for you. For me, I don't really rewatch sad ending drama that often. All I can think of now if I see IU is that there is a probability it will have a sad ending. Like Scarlet Heart all over again.
OVERALL: 9/10 - I think overall this is a good drama. The storyline is not perfect but I had fun watching this along the way until the end. I am currently having a syndrome for finishing this drama. Like, I don't know what to do next anymore.

This is my first time to write a review but IU is the one who bring me here , an amazing well played character , with a perfect facial expressions ,especially her scenes from her past life ..I was like wooow that's what's called acting !!!
Daspite man wool I think HDL was a good drama , just a GOOD one , the best part was those cute dialogues between Chan song and Man wool and SOME of the ghosts stories while most of them fail to give me any interest .The thing that keep me watching each episode is to end Manwool story which actually gave me the the greatest disappointment !! I don't have a problem with sad endings but not expected ones !! The ending was sooo poor !! I was like ohhhhh what they were saying that will happen happened actually ! Woow !! Till the last moment I was waiting for a plot switch that may surprise me and meet my expectations but nothing happened! ( Despite the glowing face of kim so hyun :p)
All the other characters played well,chan song wasn't played inappropriately as it said it was written wrong ..he has no role despite supporting man wol ..without her he is Nothing, even when they tried to talk about his life and his mother it eneded iless than a half of the the episode with a robot face and noo emtiondsotions at All !!
but I think the actor did his best actually as others do.
I loved the supporting characters in the hotel and I hopped to see much earlier scenes about their lives but it came at last episode and very briefly...
All the soundtracks were amazing !! They added an amazing touch to every scene ???????? they're in my playlist already
Overall I enjoyed it but I won't expect to repeat it again , I think watching two episodes per week was one of the important factors why I completed I!

First, I really excited about this drama ever since it aired because of IU and many people talking about this.

Story : I like the story unusual drama and Hong sister really made it.
First few episode very interesting and the rest I don't really enthusiast it. Every episode I'm really looking forward to the past scenes than the main story.

Acting : I admitted that IU be praised for this drama, some scenes IU really slayed it although her acting didn't make me stunning like his previous drama ""My Mister"" but I must say that she is a hard working for this. Yeo Jin goo really well take role the hotel manager, sometimes his acting make me amazed. But I don't feel chemistry among them, I always skip their intimate scenes because I already fall for Chung Myung???? ( Team captain). I can see the potential Chung Myung and Yeon woo for the main lead. I'm really into that Chung Myung feeling.

Conclusion : I'm really appreciate for tje costume man weol and the whole property of the drama.
I'm really disappointed with the selection of the main lead. Does not mean Yeo Jin goo as a bad, he is really potential but I think IU pairing with Lee Do Hyun be better than IUxYeo Jin goo, I can really feel the chemistry of them. In the end, I lreally hoped that Man Weol (IU) and Chung Myung end up together.

P.s: sorry for my poor english.

I loved this drama’s take on the Beauty and the Beast theme and I loved that it turned the whole trope on its head. Here, it was the woman, Jang Man Wol, who was bloodthirsty and vengeful and… stabby, and the man, Goo Chan Sung, who was soft and sweet and gentle. I love to see gender stereotypes switched.

I also loved one of the secondary pairing, Lee Mi Ra and Det. Park Young Soo (BTW, the actors both had supporting parts in My ID Is Gangnam Beauty!). I loved them because they were similar to Jang Man Wol and Goo Chan Sung: she was like a porcupine and he was just the softest…

So yes, I loved that. But around ep 13 it started to feel off. I guess it all began with the very bland ending of the vengeful spirit storyline. They built it up to this seemingly huge plot and then… a whimper, not a bang. I had a similar feeling with pretty much every subplot afterwards. Yes, all the loose ends were tied but, well, they were tied and re-tied and then tied again for a good measure, so much so that I couldn’t help but feel that the last two eps dragged - they were both 90 min. long.

Don’t get me wrong, I cried during the finale but at the end, instead of feeling satisfied and pumping my fist all, “Yes!” and “I don’t want it to end!” I felt more like, “Okay. Onward.” The best part of the final ep was the very last scene, the introduction of the new hotel owner. That was well done.

I hesitantly checked into this hotel. But every episode made me extend my stay until the very end I still didn’t want to leave hotel del Luna! It was wonderful! Dashing! And thoughtful drama. I love how the leads shared the limelight with the guests and hotel workers. The story of each character was so poignant, sad, and endearing.

Yeo Gin Goo cemented his status as one of my favorite male actors, only 22 years old but phenomenal! IU found a new fan in me! Her acting in the past was feeble but improved dramatically from a puddle to a Great Lake.

I recommend this heart-stealing gem :)

i cried my eye's out, it's worth the watch but not if you're a sensitive person or a crybaby. i kept crying.
i hate the princess the most she was a fucking shitbag i even ate her in their present life it was her fault that all of this happened, i kinda wanted jang man-wol and go chyung-myung end up together, it wasn't really Go cyung-myung fault, he was forced to marry the bitch or Jang man-wol will die

ji hyung-joong was really sweet and seeing him cry made my heart ache, i wanted to jump of a roof because i saw that they all cry why did they had to make my heart ache so much ugh it's making me cry again

Knowing how I’m such a fan of goblin I rlly was expecting not to like this drama. But I wasn’t expecting to like it more than goblin.

Why I loved the story:
The storytelling was focused, and didn’t waste time with annoying side that were useless. Each episode felt like it had its own theme or central message. Don’t get me wrong there are loads of side characters, but they all served a purpose in this drama, either to teach the other characters something or to expand this ghost world which the Hong sisters care fully created.
All the rules establish in this world wasn’t broken to create cheap tension. There were hardly any plot holes - showing how much care the hong sisters put into the storytelling
The backstory of IU enravled quite interestingly and the hong sister was able to keep me hooked but never bored by presenting new side characters
The gender role reversal in make this drama unique. It’s the man this time that open up the cold but more powerful women’s heart.
And this makes the two lead characters very interesting and watchable, as we get a man very confident in this manhood without feeling intimidated by the other half - something which I rarely see in Kdramas.
And another badass female character but whose is deeply flawed with resentment.
Yes and the story did make me cry! I was defiantly weeping the whole of the last episode.

What I don’t like in the story:
Nothing really, or I wouldn’t of given it 10/10.
Umm...I guess that the secondary couples story wasn’t that interesting - but even their story line made me cry.
There is, what feel is like a shoehorned side plot to do with the leads in the last ep but even that hardly bothered me because it tied the story up nice and neatly.

What I liked in the acting department:
IU relished in this role, you can tell she enjoyed playing this strong powerful women but she was also tender when it came to other scenes. And this I think kept most viewers (including me) hooked.
Now the thing with playing the less powerful other half is that the interest for you can just get swallowed by the other half. You most of the time also end up with less interesting traits and Yeo Jin Goo’s character is a goody two shoes with a strong moral compass- which is normally something I find off putting and very uninteresting because they tend not to have any flaws and just are there. However he has to be my fav character in the drama and I think that lends it to YJG’s acting chops, he pulls off this character really well even when there feels like there is not much for him to do.

What I didn’t like:
The chemistry with these two actors isn’t electric, but by no means bad. The don’t have the great amounts of chemistry but really I didnt feel like they needed that instant electric and overly sweet chemistry, as it may have felt disingenuous to IU’s character who has had a bad experience to love. They had sweet, touching scenes and that was enough to make me root for them but I can understand if someone else doesn’t find it enough.
Some complained about P.O’s acting but to be honest it didn't overly bother me, I though he did a fine job.

What I liked about the OST:
EVERYTHING!! It was lush and placed really well through scenes. This OST is just amazing, really has to be one of the best! My absolute fav obviously include Part 3 (obvs), 1 and 12 (both of the two Punch songs and Taeyeon’s)
The only complaint I could see someone making is that all the songs are too sad but like I don’t think anyone would deny that that are all beautiful!

Why I have already rewatched it:
The OST
The production values , from each one of IU’s stunning outfits, hairstyles and always perfect looking makeup to the really impressive CGI- this drama makes it hard for you not to rewatch.
Also the cinematography is just beautiful, everything looks gorgeous but also very distinctively ‘Hotel del luna’ like.


HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Give this one a watch, I don’t think many people would be disappointed!!

Existence and Time
I'll be honest in the review. I was not completely impressed with this drama. I felt the story and setting was heavily inspired from Master's Sun, a previous drama of the Hong Sisters and Goblin which was like a cultural reset with many dramas trying to copy it's fantasy world. Because I have already seen those two dramas, I felt deprived of an original story while watching this drama. The hotel and ghost concept was in Master's Sun while the theme for Supernatural protagonist with a curse from deity to be resolved by a human was from Goblin. There were other world building themes as well that I thought reminded me of Goblin. Because of these things, it felt a little dated.

The Good thing though is that it did manage to find a cohesive theme within the show without having to drag out any narrative. The different ghost stories though not as good as the ones in Master's Sun, did progressed story and character development. And the whole theme of resolution of one's grudge using Time and Existence as a background was good addition too.

The biggest problem the the whole drama why I couldn't back it up was the lack of chemistry between the two main leads. Ko Chang Soo as a character was the literal definition of Gary Stue(Guy Many Sue) and a Manic Pixie Dream Guy. It was even more apparent because IU and Lee Do Hyun in their past shared so much more chemistry. They were definitely the highlight.

The show had breathtaking shots and cinematography. But the heavy use of CGI and VFX did feel a little artificial. IU looked Etheral. Extra plus points to her styling department. The cameos were a treat for old IU drama lovers

Finally OST were the best part of the show. Would definitely listen to this album on repeat

Hotel Del Luna is about Korean supernatural drama about the staff of a hotel for ghosts. All of the staff members of the hotel are also ghosts except for the new manager Goo Chan Sung, and each ghost staff member has a tragic past and has something that is keeping them from moving on. The drama follows their every day life. The ghosts' have interesting stories. The cast did a great job pulling off their characters. The soundtrack was good and fit the drama very well. It's a good Halloween drama for people who don't like watching horror.

Ghost plot wins, Romance barely survives
Pros:
Individually, FL & ML are on point
costume
make up
sets/props/decor
lively ensemble

Cons:
Together, FL & ML do not generate any feeeelllllssssss aka lack of sparks between the leads
Terrible second lead syndrome with the FireFlyGuy



*SPOILERS AHEAD*

Both ML & FL are good actors with their own charms and characteristics, yet i failed to feel their sparks :(
Both actors brought their A game, yet their romance was still born.
This may be due to the writing or the directing - which seemed to be more invested on delivering the mystery/resolving ghosts' grudges plotline than on the romance.
As a result of this, JangManWol (needing to resolve her own hefty grudges in order to cross the bridge) have more sparks with the FireFlyGuy aka Go Chung-myung rather than the human Go Chan-Sung.
Halfway through the series, I was more invested in watching JMW with GCM scenes (Oh, the angst when he was getting married!) rather than the impending separation of JMW with GCS.

Watch this if you are a fan of ghosts' story line (which this drama totally delivered 10/10) and amazzziinngg dresses/make up on JMW.

Skip if you are looking for thrilling sparks of romance - interlaced with ghost stories.

Yeo Jin Goe should've done better.
It was really good, gave me some goblin vibes. That one person who said it Will have goblin-type ending was right! hehe

OST
It was okay, but i didn't really Pay attention, it wasn't ear catching.

ACTING
Maybe because i watched all dramas IU has been in that i love her so much, but she was wonderful! Her cold-hot, bratty attitude was refreshing and not annoying! Yeo Jin-goo was fine, didn't partculary stand out sadly. He was main lead but was lacking in comparison of Lee do-hyun (past lover). Lee do-hyun and IU had such good chemistry i felt sad he wasn't main lead. Personally i didnt feel anything from him, and it seemed that if he was crying or sad, i'd feel more émotion towards Sanchez than him! Even tho he is main lead!!! Everyone praised him, but personally he was the only one lacking hère. Other actors who played side characters (Mira, P.O, Yoona, Sanchez etc....) were also gréât. They weren't lacking at all, and for side characters They did a fantastical job portraying their own charisma.

PLOT
It was refreshing to see it, a girl being stuck in Life forever, hosting a hôtel for dead. Pretty unique for me, and characters were unique themselves. They all had a part in the story and weren't there just to be there. They had history which is nice! Altho there were a few cliches that i hated, it was a drama where nobody was stupid enough to let a misunderstanding drag on and have a huge impact. I loved how writers didn't pull out a wild card at the end that something magical happenes and everyone is happy! I teared up réal hard at the end, but loved the cameo of someone spécial, it created a perfect opprotunity for a second season which i hope happens. The plot was nicely written with minor plot holes, overall it wasn't the best drama out there, but for a reason its hyped and loved so much....
BUT
The ML was actually very shallow. Now that i reflect on this drama, i dont like him any bit. The actor wasn't boring per say, because that is his character. He has a personality? Where? If you told me that he was a male lead i wouldn't have believed without watching all of it, since he seems too...boring. Was he only there to drive Man Wol plot or was he suppose to have a purpose? Heck Man Wol, who wasn't suppose to be expressive emotion Wise, was more than him. Which is terrible! The only reason i would watch this again would be because IU really performed well.

I finished Hotel Del Luna late night. The cinematography is unbelievable, and this one is the best so far when it relates to paranormal drama. After I watched the first episode, I knew it will have a big potential. The plot is good, but it is a little unbalanced when it comes to quality of writing. They just need to have less ghost hunting and focus fully on character developments about Jan Man Wol and few supporting characters. Each supporting characters have one or two episodes of explaining their past. I can see it is little slow after a few episodes; however, it still executes magnificently until the ending. It does have a happy ending, but it is rather rushed and it is a cliche. Despite this one, the plot really grabs my attention quickly. It is better than Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (both have similarities), IMO. IU is one of the highlights of the entire cast due to her acting as Jang Man Wol. IU have excellent job at her role, she is very good at portraying different personalities and facial expressions. She is the reason for watching until the final episode. I am more interested in Jang Man Wol’s storyline and of course, I am prepared to learn her tragic past. Yeo Jin Goo have a great job with his emotions. His character is hilarious. The soundtrack and music are amazing! Big shouts to the writers, directors, actors/actresses, and production crew for making Hotel Del Luna an amazing and enjoyable. It is very masterpiece!

Pleasantly Amazing
Before watching HDL, I thought it wasn't going to be my ""cup of tea"". However, I was wrong, I was very wrong. HDL was amazing, fantastic, superb, wonderful in all the right bits and places. The first one or two episodes were a little slow, however, this is nothing new to me, as many Korean dramas seem that way, that's natural! But by the fifth or sixth episode, oh my gosh, I was so hooked! I loved every single character, the chemistry between the cast was phenomenal, and the storyline somehow had just the right amount of everything.

I'm not usually much of a fantasy-enthusiast but HDL may have drastically changed my opinion on the genre altogether and has made me become more aware of how great a fantasy drama can truly be.

This is a nice fantasy drama to watch - mysterious and funny . Pace is good and the story developed well.

The OST is simply amazing, almost as good as The Goblin. Two of the songs which I really liked are Yang Da Il's Only you and Heize's ""Can You See My Heart(내 맘을 볼수 있나요)"" . Many of the songs gave the drama very dreamy feel, further reminding the viewers that this is just a drama and can never happen in real life, hence, there is no need to keep our logic and rational, just go with the flow of the drama.

I love the main actress, Lee Ji-eun (as Jang Man-wol). She is so pretty in this drama! Of course Yeo Jin-goo ( Koo Chan-sung) is quite cute too, but I think Ji-eun kind of steals the spot light here. Her character is much more difficult to play as it spreads over several hundred years. In the fighting / combating scenes, she was quite good.

The plot is quite interesting , many strange things, not conventional and quite entertaining.

Would recommend to watch .

Liked it or not I think most people would agree that hotel del luna was one of the best kdramas in 2019.
Personally I don't like the one ghost/case/patient per episode type of dramas but I really liked this one.

The main story is very interesting and the main roles' stories are very creative and fun to watch.. But they didn't focus on that as much as they focused on the ghost of the episode story so that was a little disappointing.
The ghost stories were good too don't get me wrong but the main stories had more potential to have made this drama a perfect one.
Other than that, everything else was really great.
The acting was amazing. I've never watched the male or the female leads before (I've heard of them though) so I'm not biased at all.. Both of them did a great job. Actually all of the cast did (In the present and the past). The acting in this drama was one of the best I've ever seen.. Everyone was made for their part.

A must mention: IU ""ate"" her role. I can't think of other words to describe it. The first time I saw her I thought aww she's too cute to play this part but as I continued the drama I became convinced that no one was going to be able to do it better than her.

The music was pretty good too.. 2 songs are definitely going into my playlist because I can't get enough of them. And the background music was funny and new I liked it a lot.

If you don't mind the one story per episode type of dramas this is perfect for you.
And even if you're like me I think you'd find it pretty decent to watch too so give it a try.

Hi guys! Ok, so… since I gave 10/10 in almost every category you may think I'm not objectively judging the drama. But, no matter how many times I thought about some possible flaws in this drama, I couldn't think of anything really big. That means, high score!

Let's start with the first category: the story. This is the only category in which I gave 9.5. I loved the story. Rich in twists, very well written and it kept me with my mouth wide open for the shock/surprise the 95% of the drama...the remaining 5% I was crying so it was open so that I could breathe. There were only a few things that I would have added in some cases, but...that's fine!

Next: acting/cast. Here we come! Can we talk about how awesome IU has been for the whole drama? She's Amazing! I loved to see how badass she can be. I mean, among her dramas I only watched Moon Lovers, and there she was as perfect, for sure, but the character was different: sweet, innocent and naive (sometimes even too naive!). So I was really surprised: she caught me completely off guard. Queen!
Also, Yeo Jin Goo! What can I say? I love him, I've loved him in other dramas and I loved him even more here. Great acting, great chemistry, they were sooooo beautiful! He made me laugh and cry and laugh again within five minutes.
I also loved all the other cast: they were superb. Great acting! Amazing.

Music: beautiful, BEAUTIFUL OST. I won't name them all, but: Heize, Punch, IU, Gummy, etc… great names, great voices, great songs, great singing. Check it out. Can't stop listening to the songs on YT.

Rewatch: same as above, I didn't feel many differences, even if I already knew the plot. It allowed me to notice even more details that I had missed before.

Overall, this is a fantastic drama! You should definetely give it a try, because it deserves it.
Bye and...thanks for reading!

Heartwarming with a bittersweet aftertaste
I am in love with what this drama makes you feel! It gives you this bittersweet taste of not knowing for certain what should be bitter and what should be sweet. A lot of scenes were shown to supposedly be pleasant yet the emotions it translates leaves you clutching at your heart; confused as to what you should actually be feeling.

There are certain plot holes but they could be easily overlooked because of how flexible the plot is: anything can happen when it's fantasy. The main couple also exudes with chemistry and I am loving how pure and selfless their romance is with the whole ""I love you enough to let you go"" trope. I also love their cute and wholesome bickering, adds so much fluffiness to my heavy heart. Their love is very subtle yet leaves a very deep impression to the viewers.

Each character also has their individual subplots which adds more flavor to the overall story - especially loved the whole parallelism of the female lead's past and present (and how they tackled reincarnation). I will always remember how effective this storyline is in evoking conflicting and contradicting emotions, which takes this drama a notch above other dramas with similar premises.

Do you want to watch a fashion show ? You'll get it !
This Drama is quite disappointing unless you watch it for the actors, the settings and the costumes.
UI is nothing less than a Top model, so beautifully dressed.... I swear you would like to wear every dress, shoes and hats she is in ! You will envy her slim silhouette and beautiful hair styles.
About the story ? Nothing interesting indeed, not even the main love story. I admit that there are some good moments but nothing that will make you think that this drama is a must watch one.
The OST is really good, very sentimental : I loved it.
If you love fashion shows and top models, this drama should make you happy... unless you can't stand ghosts and evil spirits...
You won't miss a lot if you don't watch this drama, every actor was very good though.

One of the more unique rom coms
First of all I dropped it the first time I tried watching it. But when I picked it up again and finished watching it recently I was glad I gave it another shot. It was a beautiful drama. As someone who loves beautiful visuals, this drama was a literal eye-candy (except for the horror parts, which were a bit icky). It was also one of the very few dramas which satisfied me in the music part too. The OSTs were amazing. As an audio-visual treat this drama was 10 out of 10. That being said the drama had a good story with some volume to it which was evenly paced and kept me interested to know what happens next. It had it's fair share of loving and touching moments, silly and serious moments, which kept the drama from becoming stale after it hit a certain point (unlike most other dramas which loses their momentum at the half-way point). As a horror drama it's not scary at all, so if you are here for the horror then you will be disappointed.

One of the major reasons I dropped it the first time was the ML. The acting of the male lead felt too stiff and awkward the first few episodes. It was a major disappointment for me at that time and so I dropped it. Now after watching the whole drama I can say, in the later episodes the acting seemed a bit more natural and it was good.
But I was pleasantly surprised with the Ma Go (support) character as the actress did a very amazing job in my opinion. The female lead seemed perfect for her character too. She made the cold character seem very lovable throughout the whole drama.

It's already been a while since it's release, and if you are still wondering whether to watch it or not then don't be like me. Just watch it. It's worth the watch.

~Overall tight plot and unique writing with a mix of horror fantasy and romantic comedy
~Pulls all emotional strings balancing the stories of the leads as well as the ghost guests. The journey through life and death as well as morality often makes a mark
~All the leads and side characters nailed their performances. IU plays one of the most iconic characters ever seen in kdramaland as well as the gazillion wardrobe goals she gives the viewers. ~Personally, I liked the chemistry between the FL and SML better than with the ML.
~Shoutout to the gorgeous cinematography and OST of the show.
~I also loved how the ending played out perfectly in line with the drama’s concept.

Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Romance, Suspense, Thrill - This has it all
It's a mix of all genre (excl. Melodramma!!!, THANK THE AUTHORS FOR THAT).

Acting/Cast:
IU oh the goddess plays a phenomenal FL, portraying a badass women in power to a sensitive and vulnerable person wating for the right one. She plays as an amazing proprietor, bringing a mix of comic, tsundere and warm-quirky personality to the table. With her at the center the show was full of laughter.
In terms of the ML, however there isn't much to comment on and perhaps a slightly better plot for the role could have presented more to comment on. Overall the acting was good (as usual) and doesn't leave much to comment on.
Other recurring casts weren't also fine with my favorite being the receptionist (he was too cute). The cast was well matched with IU as hotel staff and had complete backstories. They portrayed their respective roles quite well and matched to the theme of the show perfectly.

Story:
If I have to compare the storyline it is similar to xxxHolic (Anime and Manga series from CLAMP). It had all the similar vibes with a guy being able to see the supernatural and getting help from a woman. I loved xxxHolic and loved this too, especially the cast for the FL lead (if they decide to make a live-action remake for xxxHolic, IU and Seo Yea Ji are the ones to go for).
The series had new plots however didn't feel much intuitive compared to other ghost stories. Still it managed to keep me at the edge of chair, waiting for what happens next, guessing what new trouble our dear ML lands himself in, or how the devilish beauty of a FL rescues him. (slight spoiler)

There isn't much of a rewatch value for this reason alone.

The story wrapped up on a good note, however, it felt too short and could have lasted for atleast 8-9 more episodes quite easily. I still await the second season starring (starring Kim Soo Hyun). But then I feel the same for most K-dramas,

It took me a long time wanting to watch this KDrama. It actually put fear in my heart. I don't like watching anything that has to do with the dead. I finally got up enough nerve to watch it. The storyline was great, nothing to worry about. What I loved about it was how those who passed had somewhere to go before they went on to the afterlife. Or a place to be judged before you go to the netherworld or the afterlife I mean. I loved parts where they prevented death or help those who have passed. I love IU in this, she is one beautiful actress/singer. She played her character with excellence. Yeo Jin Goo is another handsome actor, who also played his character with excellence as well. He made me emotional when he was emotional. The storyline actually felt real. That is because everyone worked as a team to make this story feel real. The visuals, the hotel, costumes, all of it I loved. I will watch it again.

Amazing production
This fantasy drama is very much along the same genre as the Goblin. Resentful of a betrayal that happened 1300 years ago, Jang Man Wol was trapped in a hotel by a deity who kept her there as the CEO to stop her from going berserk and turning into a vengeful ghost. Then came the kind-hearted Goo Chan Song who ended up working for her because of a deal his father made with Jang. He tried to put a stop to her excessive spending and disastrous finances, and interfered with her attempt at revenge which could affect her chance of a good reincarnation. The story was centred around their relationship and work, and his changing attitude towards her.

I watched this drama to take a break from Chinese dramas which were getting to be more of the same - repeating the same threads of scenarios which had been successful in earlier dramas. The obvious cultural differences in the dramas were refreshing. The storyline of this drama is simpler than the intense scheming, obsessive lovers and rivalries often featured in Chinese dramas.

I rated this drama highly for many good reasons. The most important is I enjoyed it and actually watched it again. The plot was interesting and developed well. The story behind Jang's unfortunate past unfolded along the drama. Mysteries involving the lives of ghost visitors and staff also enriched the drama.

The acting skills of the cast were excellent. The handsome male lead and pretty female lead had this amazing chemistry. Good looking leads always make a big difference, but they need to act well too which is crucial.

The drama invoked a range of emotions. The verbal 'quarrels' between the leads were quite humorous in many parts and made me laughed. But it also managed to make me cry - few dramas managed to do that and this has become a measure for dramas I watched. Often, I found crying scenes boring and wished they would past quickly. The drama was well paced and I could not recall any dull moments.

Lee Ji Eun (Jang Man Wol) appeared in every scene with a new outfit - almost like a fashion parade. They must have gotten a lot of sponsorships from fashion houses or designers. Otherwise, clothes would have cost a fortune to produce this drama. Yes, I love beautiful costumes.

Then, the backdrop of the hotel was glamorous - the hotel lobby, the view from the balcony, and the wine bar - I guess some might be computer graphics but done very well.

There were of course some shortcomings - mainly inconsistencies. Early in the drama, it was said that ghost could not appear in camera. Yet in a scene later, someone saw the ghost in the library through her mobile phone. Towards the end, the staff at the hotel took photos together.

The ending was bitter-sweet. When the ghosts found resolution to their resentment, it was also time to say goodbye as they moved onto the afterlife. You would feel happy that they moved on but sad at the parting. In the early episodes, Jang said she was alive and not a ghost; yet towards the end of the drama she was referred to as a ghost.

Overall, I enjoyed this drama a lot and would recommend it highly. If you had watched the Goblin and enjoyed it, you may also like this one.

This is worth your time
This K-Drama is definitely worth watching! It has a very unique plot and has very amazing characters.
For example, Jang Man-Wol. She's the CEO of Hotel Del Luna and has a very unique personality. She likes expensive things and wants everything!

The ending was really sad though... Jang Man-Wol had to cross the Samdocheon bridge. Before that, the staff members disappeared one by one, which means JMW has to go too, leaving KCS alone in the human world. And if JMW disappears, Hotel Del Luna would have come to an end..

Though the end was really sad, it still is worth watching and has a unique plot.
The acting of the actors was also VERY impressive! They portrayed the characters greatly!

One of my favourite Kdramas
Hotel Del Luna is one of the earlier Kdramas I've seen when I started regularly watching Kdramas in 2020 and it's one that pops back into my mind from time to time. As I'm watching this review I feel happiness that I got to watch this amazing drama as well as sadness that I'm no longer watching it.

This story is about a Jang Man-Wol who is a 1000 year old ghost who loves to spend and has a grudge, she has to work at a special hotel to make amends. Koo Chan-Sung is a young man with exceptional experience managing hotels, who for one reason or another ends up at Hotel Del Luna and is in way over his head.

I loved everything about this drama, the acting from everyone is fantastic, especially IU who plays Jang Man-Wol, (I still have to check out some of her other dramas). I enjoyed the storyline that was interesting, I liked that we had the stories about the hotel quests as well as the overall story about Jang Man-Wol. I thought IU was so lucky to have an exceptional wardrobe of fancy clothes as well as nice cars, she looked beautiful in all her clothes. The sets and the CGI created breathtaking scenes of some places I won't mention because it spoils too much. I also liked seeing how the hotel has changed throughout the years.

Even though I saw Hotel Del Luna 2 years ago I still remember some of the soundtrack and I have a couple of the songs on my playlist, they are; Punch Done For Me and Taeyeon All About You. The soundtrack really enhanced the emotions of some scenes.

I found myself being terrified, laughing and crying throughout Hotel Del Luna. There was a hint of another season and I'm hanging for it, I don't normally rewatch Kdramas but I can see myself rewatching Hotel Del Luna.

One of the best fantasy dramas! Spooky, mysterious, overall beautiful!
I cried, I laughed, I swooned, I loved EVERYTHING about Hotel del Luna. Of course IU is one of my favorite actresses, she did a amazing job. Jang Mon Wol is a QUEEN and her and Goo Chan Sung's relationship was everything, Their growth as characters and the way they both impacted one another. Each and every single character in this kdrama was interesting, there was not one dull character. SO many back stories and details that really brought the whole drama to life. It's original, unique and mystical. HIGHLY recommend this drama, the visuals were beautiful, OST was my favorite in a long time. If you like fantasy type dramas you need to watch this one. DEFINITELY one of my top favorites. It's spooky, mysterious, majestic and just *chefs kiss* ! Amazing. Please watch this one. ^_^

Rewatch value is off the charts
This show grew on me like no other show. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first since I am not really a fan of fantasy shows but Hotel Del Luna really made me forget all about it.

The incredible depth this show’s story has is incomparable - it touches the deepest corners of your heart and doesn’t let you go months after you finished watching. I absolutely loved all the fantastical and mythical elements that were inserted into the show and how they all mixed together with the ‘human’ world to create something so uniquely beautiful and touching.

Needless to say that the acting was superb! And the OST, in my opinion, is one of the best - if not THE best (IU’s song will surely make you cry if you read the lyrics).

TL;DR: you won't regret watching this show - it truly grows on you and doesn't let go, even months after finishing it! (re-watched it 5 times already)

I want a season 2 or I'll sue
OMG that this was a rollercoaster of emotions. It was very aesthetically pleasing and if you love fantasy romance, with slight horror? It's the perfect thing. I was very late to watch this drama, because somehow when things are very new and popular I tend not to watch it, however, I should have totally watched this when the hype was there!

In terms of plot, I really liked it! It gave me slight Beauty and the Beast vibes at the beginning with the dad wanting to give the flower to his son then the girl being like I'll leave you if you give him to me lmao. Also, I really liked this whole idea of a hotel for the dead, like if I die and I don't see this I ain't dying HAHA. For the acting, the fact that IU and P.O were in this was incredible their acting skills are amazing. Yeo Jin Goo was also really good at his role, he was definitely fun for no reason and did a good job in this drama. Since I watched this after Sulli's death makes me sad, but thank god she played someone who was alive, or else I would have probably cried for days.

For the characters, P.O's character was definitely my favorite! He was just so wholesome and his back story was so sad. The way I bawled my eyes out for him and Yu-na like my babies bro :') they were so cute together, I always thought that a ghost and a human romantic dynamic would go like this.. I love angst lmao. Move on to Sanchez, he was my man!!! He was such an amazing friend for Chan-sung and damn that I cried for him when Veronica died, they really did them dirty when they killed off his girlfriend right before he was going to proposed like angst x100. Man-wol was just the baddest bitch on the block, and that's on periodt! She was THE bitch and I really liked how Chan-sung was able to stand her character even though she always did questionable stuff, that's why I loved their relationship. She had definitely a sad past, which hurts my poor little heart so much, the way she had to watch Yun Woo, which he's technically is like a brother to her, die in front of her, thinking that the man she loved did that cuz he wanted to all along was just the biggest misunderstanding in history, which she knew after like a thousand years later. Plus the way she left for the afterlife at the end I couldn't handle it anymore I was crying~~~ Plus Chung Myung had THE saddest second lead ending lmao, the way this boy waited by her side all those years and all she had to do was say his name, then when they finally met he had to leave to the afterlife right after, my man did not deserve this :'(( I don't many things to say about Mr. Kim and Miss Choi, but I can say they were just so wholesome legit those 2 plus Hyun Joong were family for Man-wol and they had to leave :'). I'll say that I liked that Mi-ra and the cop got together even though one killed the other in their past life, they were a cute couple, that fight a lot, but still cute. Finally, some of the Ma-go sisters were HILARIOUS, while others either were so unclear with what they say or they meanies lmao (if you know you know)

I also loved Kim So Hyun showing up at the end, the way he stoled the whole show looking all sexy while I was just bawling my eyes out.

So yeah, great show the end gives mayor second-season possibility, but we can all dream, but if it doesn't happen I'll sue. It was just pain at the end like I get that the staff of the hotel may leave and stuff but MAN-WOL TOO please I wanted to see her be happy with Chan-sung at least in another life I don't know!

A Drama you will never forget
I just watched a beautiful drama of monumental proportions. I was immersed from the first episode to the end. I’ve never watched a drama quite like this one. It was thought provoking, emotional and romantic. In total it’s about 22 hours long. I watched it in three days. It was that good.

The cast was fantastic. The story was built around IU’s character Jang Man Wol as the owner of Hotel Del Luna. She was gorgeous and portrayed her character to perfection. The ML, Yeo Jin Goo, was great as the hotel manager, Goo Chan Sung. Together they supported the main flow of the story and found love as the story progressed. It wasn’t a love story of unbridled passion but it was a heart wrenching, emotional romance across generations.

The drama brought in side stories of the other characters that gave purpose to the entire storyline. There was the present and the past in every story. The characters were well constructed and supported. The script and the directing were amazing in my opinion.

Everything about this drama was wonderful
I like everything about this drama , the characters was so amazing and the actors play their roles awesome ... I feel like i was there with them 🥺🤩 at Final episodes i really crying and i thought i couldn't keep living without watching this drama 😅😅😅 really hope there will be season 2 😁👻 and most important thing about the story was this : I do not want to regret after my death . All of them had something in the world of alive people , so because of that they couldn't let they lives go simply , they tried to do their best for their important person even when they were died.

First It was Woooow
Then great
Then just OK
with a failure FL with dead face expression and stupid ending for me

AS USUAL THE END 🤦🏻‍♀️
The writer made them all apart
He could make mi na go with p.o because she is already a ghost

And I saw it was so unfair for do hyun the fl's ex

And simply the writer could compensated the FL By making her choose to be back to the ML after living all these years suffering

But NOOOO
THEY should make stupid open ending which was really annoying
left us with a ML wishing he will be gathered with her oneday
And I don't know why?

I like and dislike at the same time
And the last 3 eps. Weren't necessary
The drama was full of many unnecessary side story and they dropped the main past one
They just came through it quickly and you should figure out what happened by yourself
And I think it was going to be a spectacular drama if they focused more on the past and present story
And a little bit side stories
But this was stupidity

And the romance was lukewarm
So I can't figure out whether I liked or not
But think not

Worth to watch!
Omo! Omo! Honestly I don't really like fantasy drama except for Goblin but this one is exceptional. I like the storyline, I like all the characters, I even like the guest stars. I like all the soundtracks, I like the cinematography, I like all the set. Everything is 'thumbs up!'

It's just that I don't really understand about the ending. Are they meeting again or they just hoping to get a chance to meet again? Well, whatever. As long as I am happy watching it. At first I was just wondering, why the director choose this very young Yeo Jin Goo to be the lead hero in this such of drama. I have no confidence with him. 😬 But after watching it, now I know why. He is a very good actor. No doubt about it.

So now, after finished watching them, I had my conclusion. Among all of the main characters, supporting role or guest actors, in the end I think I've got a crush with this detective! Thank you for keeping him 'alive' since the 1st episode until the end. 😬

Anyway, for those who still not watching it, you better try this one. You will not regret. Worth to watch, entertaining, cool and steady.

Love is the most powerful force in the universe!
I just finished this drama (I know I'm late to the party, 2 years later Lol)!! I've only been watching Asian dramas for a year now, so that's why. I just finished it, and it's difficult to say how I feel about it. It's not the best show I have ever seen and definitely not the worst. Watching this in 2021, after I've already seen Goblin and It's Ok to Not be Okay (hands down one of the best Korean dramas ever created), Hotel Del Luna fell a little short in comparison. Goblin and IOTNBO deal with very similar themes such as trauma, healing, letting go, forgiveness, reincarnation, etc., but I personally feel that those dramas did a better job with tackling these issues.

That said, I agree 100% with what every reviewer has commented about this show: the cinematography is spectacular! Everything from the directing, camera angles, color grading, locations, and costumes are STUNNING! This doesn't even look like a television series, it looks more like a movie. I can't even imagine what the budget was for this series, it must have been astronomical :)

What I like:
-IU single handedly carried this show, without a doubt!! Nothing against the other actors, but her story was the most compelling. Her acting was powerful, mature, multidimensional, and convincing. Her backstory was so fascinating to watch.
-I've read other reviews of this show stating, Hotel Del Luna has a very Buddhist central storyline and I couldn't agree more. The themes of forgiveness, suffering, attachments, and healing from trauma are incredibly powerful.
-Like I said before, huge props to the director and creators of this show. This is a visually pleasing drama. Episode 16 where Man Wol is crossing the afterlife bridge is a visual treat! Between the stunning color grading, instrumental music, and camera angles, I wish I could tattoo that scene on my body!!! It is THAT good!
-The music is pretty good. I'm not a fan of the official soundtrack (even though I know there are some big Korean stars singing), it just feels a little cheesy. I personally think the background/instrumental music fits this drama perfectly and I loved it.

What I didn't like:
-The ML actor. Nothing personal against him, I really didn't connect with his character and I did not see the chemistry between him and IU. I also feel like his character was very one dimensional. His character was very sweet, but I didn't see any depth with him (I'm not sure if it was because of the script or his acting).
-The episodes were way too long. 1 hour and 20 minutes per episode is crazy! This led to many episodes feeling dragged out. I would much have preferred this drama to have 30-40 min. episodes.
-Some of the side ghost stories were amazing and many of the other stories felt like ""fillers"". This led me to feeling very bored and wanting to go back to Man Wol's back story.
-I didn't fully ""connect"" to this drama like I have with others. I'm not sure why, I'm only led to believe that the poor script at times is why I feel this way?

Overall, this drama was good (maybe okay), definitely not the best drama I've ever seen. I actually think when I have some free time, I might come back to this drama and try to watch it fully again. I'm wondering if I just wasn't in the right head space to watch and appreciate it. There are truly some heartwarming and amazing scenes in this drama, the problem is that they're so few and far in between. I appreciate all of the hard work that went into making this drama. I just felt that by the end, it was still missing that ""wow"" factor to truly stand out and I couldn't connect with it fully.

Visually stunning, impeccable storyline and beautiful drama
Hotel del Luna was such a refreshing drama for me. I haven't seen many fantasy dramas but the plot of this one really got me interested. Besides the plot, the trailer itself was intriguing and visually stunning as well which is what led me to watch this drama. It definitely lives up to the hype and even exceeded my expectations of the fantasy drama genre.

WHAT I LIKED:
Plot/Storyline: I loved the main storyline of this drama and how it was written and portrayed throughout the episodes. The story was like I said very intriguing as you only get snippets of the main plot line which kept me guessing and curious for most of the episodes. Besides the main character (Man-Wol's) story, there were also little storylines on most of the episodes that featured the ghost guests and the supporting casts. I found these little stories beautifully written and meticulously intertwined with the main story. For most of the little storylines and of course the main plot, there were also lessons to be learned which the writer effortlessly taught the viewers.

Cinematography & Editing: Hotel del Luna is no doubt the most visually stunning drama I have watched to date. The visual effects, the camera work/angles, the stunning sets and locations and of course Man-Wol's unrivalled wardrobe all made for such an exquisite looking drama. We have to give it up to the make-up, wardrobe and editing team especially. The way they've edited and made the ghosts look, really made this drama even more fantasy-like and out of this world.

OSTs: The Original Soundtrack was just absolutely perfect in this drama. So many wonderful songs from K Drama OST legends like Punch, Heize, 10CM and more. Every time the songs came on during certain scenes, it just tugged at your heart even more. Some scenes towards the end were really heightened by the OSTs and definitely made them 10x more emotional which is exactly what an OST should do. Aside from the OSTs, the different sound effects were also very very well done in a lot of scenes. They added so much to the scenes like the comedy ones, the high tension ones and of course the scary scenes. Whoever did them deserves an applause for sure.

Acting & Characters: Ok, I'm most definitely late to the IU party but better late than never, right? I can now definitely see why IU gets so much love. Her acting is just so sensational and she makes it look so effortless too. It's just amazing how she showed so many sides of her acting/emotions in this drama from being serious, scary, comedic and of course all the heartfelt emotional acting too.
Of course, our lead guy Yeo Jin Goo is absolutely magnificent as well. It's hard to believe that he is only in his early twenties as his acting skills and career can rival many actors that are older than him. My favourite scene in this drama was a solo scene by Jin Goo at a bus stop. It was an emotional scene that tugged at my heart. This particular scene was so well done and so gut-wrenching and almost hard to watch because of how emotional it was. Jin Goo's performance in this particular scene was so so good that I won't be forgetting it for a while. Alongside his emotional scenes, there were his funny and scary scenes which were just so entertaining and great to watch too. The chemistry between the two main actors was just perfect and both of them really complimented each others acting.
I have to mention the supporting actors as well, they did such a great job with their own storylines too. They not only complimented the main characters but shined on their own as well. The casting director did a really splendid job with this drama.

WHAT I DISLIKED:
There's not much to dislike about this drama. The only things I probably didn't like is:
1.) 2nd lead guy/first love's story that sometimes outshined Chan-Sung/Jin Goo's love story with Man-Wol. I understand from the plot line why it's important and why it was written and portrayed the way it did but during the climax of the story it almost made me root for them more than Chan-Sung and Man-Wol, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But it just took away some of that highlight between the 2 main characters towards the end.
2.) Personally, I am a sucker for a good happy ending, that's just my personal preference. I totally understand why the ending happened the way it did. It was very important to the story line and it was something that had already been mentioned throughout the episodes leading to the ending but as I said, I am a 'they lived happily ever after' kinda person so that's what I would've hoped for. Although saying that, the last scenes were still beautiful and happy which I appreciate from the writers.

WOULD I RECOMMEND:
Absolutely, 100%. If you're into fantasy, romance, comedy or just want something different from the norm of KDramas, then this one is definitely one to watch. There's just so many good things about this drama that it would be amiss not to watch it.

WOULD I REWATCH:
Probably but not straight away. I feel like I could re-watch this drama after a few months/a year after finishing it as it will be a nice refreshing drama to watch compared to other KDramas I normally watch (romance/melodaramas/love triangles, etc). Plus I'd re-watch this just to see Man-Wol's incredible wardrobe again and gawk at the visuals of the whole drama.

A beautiful, original and profound drama about forgiveness.

OK, I have a lot of words to say about this drama. But honestly your best choice is not to waste anymore time on reviews and just go watch it. I can’t possibly do it justice so just trust me when I say, it’s incredible and there’s no better use of your time. Go now!

The cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay and the handling of product placements are all fantastic. Then there’s IU, who has long been my favorite Kdrama actor. She’s always fabulous, with a dark intelligence that suggests hidden depths and an astonishing range. She chooses her roles well, but this is the part she was born to play - a complicated, twisted but charming supernatural who has the self awareness to see her situation clearly but lacks the humility to get herself out.

Astonishingly, the storyline bears no resemblance to a classic kdrama. There’s no male CEO, no stalker second female lead, or even a second male or female at all. It starts in the Josean era but rather than the usual “our story ended badly then but we’ll fix it this time around” it’s all a continuation. And then there’s this crazy plot structure where a seemingly minor character is actually the emotional heart of the story. And, it’s thematically consistent, with all the stories layering and adding clarity to the theme.

I used the word “profound” earlier and that’s a word I don’t think has ever occurred to me to apply to a kdrama, but damn if I didn’t learn something important from this one. In fact, I consider an alternate title for this drama could be “Forgiveness, You’re Doing It Wrong.”

OK, so now I’m going to go into literary analysis mode and talk about the story and the themes. I’ll try to do it without revealing any plot points but if you don’t want to know what the themes are -just go watch it now and avoid my boring rehash! (Seriously-go now!)

The first thing that needs to be said is, this is a thoroughly Buddhist storyline. And by that I don’t just mean in it’s use of traditional Korean cosmology (the goddess Mago, the grim reapers and other gods). The central message of Buddhism is that attachment is the root of all suffering and the premise of this drama - a hotel where the dead go to work through their attachments so they can pass peacefully to the next world is the perfect set up to explore all the myriad attachments that keep us humans stuck even when we know we need to let go. As they say multiple times in the drama, “it takes more strength to let go than to hold on.”

While the drama does take the time to explore other kinds of attachments, the main character’s story is about grudge holding and the inability to forgive. Ostensibly she’s waiting around to find the person who wronged her so she can destroy them and thus destroy herself. But, as she herself recognizes, “It’s not them that you hate. It’s yourself you loathe for not having been able to protect what matters most to you.”

Which brings me to what I think of as the “iceberg character.” There’s a seemingly minor character with very little screen time (the 10% of the iceberg you can see) whose story, when fully revealed, is the heartbreaking emotional center of the drama (the 90% you can’t see). At the end of episode 14, when you find yourself wrung out and damp beside an empty box of Kleenex, you’ll know you’ve hit it. Because the theme of this drama isn’t just that we need to forgive ourselves so we can let go and stop suffering, it’s that we need to forgive ourselves because we are at our most cruel and implacable when we’re projecting our self hate outwards onto others. Even though it isn’t really about them, the harm we cause is real.

And once again, I’m blown away by the psychological astuteness of kdrama writers. There’s one scene (slight spoiler ahead-sorry I can’t resist) where she takes the version of herself from the time of her trauma, the version of herself she most hates, (We see a heart broken young woman overwhelmed by circumstance, but we know she sees her as hatefully foolish and weak.) and turns her into a curse. It’s only when this cursed self is returned to her and she accepts it that she can begin to forgive This is literally the most perfect (and accurate) depiction of what traumatized people do with their memories and of what they have to do to heal.

And last of all, I want to say, I don’t watch dramas looking for the profound and life changing either, I’m looking for fun and entertainment. And this drama is a blast. Even though I was bawling all through episode 14, this isn’t the kind of devastating drama that’s practically a trauma to watch. (“the Smile Has Left Your Eyes”, I’m looking at you.) In fact, I turned right around and watched it again because it’s a perfect blend of fun, funny and deep.

Why are you still reading this? Go watch it now!

Watch it!
A superb drama- so well written and the actors were just so good! A really great and unusual story which had me gripped from the first to last episode. The main female character was so well drawn- her back story and development so beautifully told. So good to see a nuanced and strong female character. The stories of the other employees were equally fascinating. The cinematography was beautiful, her outfits stunning.
You will cry many times but so worth it! Thete is nothing to dislike in this drama and everything to love!

THE POWER OF IMAGINATION.
yin story per se is nothing new or unexpected. However, the casting, production, direction and EDITING .. was spectacular.
IU is hands down one of the most talented actress of her age, paired with a VETERAN and CHAMELEONIC actor such as Yeo Jin Goo ...you already have a solid base. The screenwriting and editing are in sync and polished. A complicated intersections of people, twist and turns at each corner and yet no problem following the story, enjoy it, and re-watched it periodically. The production did a great job with maintaining a ""low profile"" and yet deliver a clean, yet artistic concept. The hotel per se feel so real in this paradoxical and dystopian reality that it doesn't make sense and yet it just does. I adored it.
I ADORED THE LIMOUSINE, AND THE STORY OF THE ELDERLY MAN WITH THE DOG.
It was hearth wrenching but so well done.
The final touch is the 3 goddesses. LOVE LOVE THE IDEA. It's the perfect definition of what yin and yang mean to me. Never full light , never total darkness. Just variations of it.

A Nocturnal K-Drama
HIGHLIGHTS: Sumptuous cinematography and set designs. Beautiful and mysterious soundtrack that expressed perfectly the mood and ambiance of the drama. Intriguing plot with plenty of twists and turns to maintain interest.

I liked IU’s performance as Jang Man-wol. There was enough nuance in her performance to keep me intrigued. But I didn’t think she had the physicality and aggressiveness to inhabit her role as bandit and fighter in her earlier life. Yeo Jin-Goo'’s acting seemed too exaggerated and annoying in the first episode but I grew to like his character. Overall, the cast and acting was very good.

For me, chemistry is the most important element in a K-drama. There’s plenty of moments when emotions cut loose but what makes this drama really successful is the tension from all the emotions that are held in check. After watching parts of the series for a second time, I gained a greater appreciation for the script. Jang Man Wol and Go Chun Myung were in a passionate love/hate relationship. And this was while she was fully human. Jang Man Wol and Ku Chan Son's relationship was a counterbalance to that. Jang Man Wol was no longer quite human, she was Koo Chan-Sung boss, and both implicitly understood that she was destined to cross the bridge. So their dynamic was one of an understated, unrequited love mixed with an awkward brother/sister relationship. I feel the contrast between the two relationships made the drama a richer experience. But the problem I had with Yeo Jin-Goo's acting is that it appeared to be overacted and inauthentic much of the time. Jang Man Wol also had a warm, heartfelt relationship with her staff which again, was understated, making it a more emotionally nuanced and engaging dynamic.

This isn’t the kind of drama you watch while working out at the gym. It’s far from your typical rom-com. While it has its fun and playful moments, the overall tone is darker and more introspective — perfect for a quiet evening under the spell of the full moon.

So if you've watched Master's Sun, you'll realize Hotel Del Luna follows the same format (because of being the same writers) of telling the main story while at the same time show minor stories of guest characters in each episode, some lasting longer than others. For me, the main story progressed at an okay pace. At the beginning, the first episode grasp your attention, wanting more, but a couple episodes after that, it was slower than I would've liked. I like the minor stories but some of them overpower the main plot when I really just want to see more of Man Wol's story.

STORY: That being said, I think the plot to Man Wol's story was revealed pretty well. It had a beginning, a middle, and a end. I like it how it leaves me guessing a lot so it wasn't predictable for the most part. What was predictable was knowing the ending was going to be heartbreaking just based on the plot and scenario itself but it matched up pretty well to what I expected.

While I did like most of the minor stories of the guest characters, my only problem was there wasn't much relation to the main plot or the main/support characters. I would've cared more of the minor stories if it somehow reminded Man Wol or the other hotel staff about their past lives and it showed some steady progression on how to move on to the afterlife eventually. I mean I just didn't like how they neglected the stories of the support character roles until the very end, like literally the last few episodes. I also didn't like how some minor stories like Chan Sung's mom or Sanchez's girlfriend had potential to have a bigger impact on the plot but was cut short like it was mistake in writing or something. This was something I had a bit of frustration in Master's Sun as well.

ACTING: For the most part, the acting from these actors & actresses were pretty good. IU shows a great deal of emotions, from being heartbroken & betrayed, a stern woman, to having a comedic side when it comes to money. Yeo Jin Goo's acting was a bit boring for me in the beginning. I felt like that didn't give him an opportunity to really show what he can do in his acting but that quickly improved towards the middle and end of the drama, especially his crying scenes. My favorite actor has to be Ji Hoon from this drama. He plays Hyun Joong so well. You just love it when he's happy because he has that puppy smile that makes you want to smile but when he's sad, you just can't help but be sad with him.

MUSIC: Rarely is there a drama where I enjoy and add every ost to my playlist but this drama is one of them. The ost are just amazing and it fits very well to every situation in this drama. Punch's songs ""Done For Me"" & ""Another Day"" with Monday and Yang Da Il - Only You, are my favorites from this drama.

REWATCH VALUE: This is one I would definitely consider rewatching however I would probably skip the minor stories this drama shows since the main plot has more value overall.

I'm out of tears
At first I didn't know if I should watch this drama cause it had so much hyped I was afraid I'd dislike it. Now that I'd finished it, I know why it had so much hyped and why it received so much love. The plot is interesting, this concept of a hotel where the dead go before going to the afterlife. That, plus the thing with past lives and reincarnation, amazing.

I'll be honest, the best thing that happened to this drama is its ost. So many good songs that go well with each scene, they set the mood perfectly, I can't complain. There were two songs that stucked with me the most, Can you see my heart and Done for me... uffff those two songs, every time they came out I'd cry my eyes out and sob like a baby.

Another thing that I really liked was IU's acting, I can't help but think that there was no other actress that could've taken the role, Jieun was perfect for Man Wol's character. Also, I really liked the quemistry she had with Jingoo, really loved the couple.

I think the only down side with this drama is that the last few episodes are long af and the story starts to drag a little bit, but other than that I really liked it.

Also, the last episode broke my heart. So prepare tissues if you're gonna watch it.

I enjoyed the drama, the set is beautiful and Jang Man Wol is the primary character in this drama.

The drama itself has beautiful production, the scenes, Jang Man Wol fashion lol

Jang Man Wol has many layers and IU had showcased her character beautifully. The cute, happy, sad, tormented, mad scenes were acted in a way that I do think she is Jang Man Wol and she does it in a way that's believable and consistent with her character. She's the star of this drama and others are just there to support her character which is unusual since most of the time it's the male lead.

I do think that Jang Man Wol has more chemistry with Chung Myung romantically than Chan Sung. I'm actually more interested in the back story than her scenes with Chan Sung. I think of Jang Man Wol and Chan Sung relationship would have been better as platonic than a romantic one.

I wished the ghost stories were not so prominent per episode though, it'll have been better if those scenes were shorten and give the time to show the developing relationships with the Hotel Del Luna staff and, Jang Man Wol and Chan Sung.

The casts were really good too, they portrayed their roles really well, it's just that everything seems so rushed in the latter episodes in terms of resolution for the Hotel Man Wol staff and I prefer to have seen more of their stories than the other ghosts.

One of the best dramas for 2019
I decided to watch this drama purely because of the title. It was very catchy and so was the poster. I haven't checked the cast so I was suprised to see I.U but I gave it a shot although I'm not a fan of hers ( sorry not sorry). I have to admit that she was really good and proffessional , I was impressed. The story was really good , funny in most parts but there was the nessesary drama as well (and the needed romance of course). I really loved the aisthetics and I.U 's clothes (her stylist did a really good job). Even if you don't like watching supernatural / fairtytale / ghost dramas I think this drama has a little bit of everything and you will definitely like it.

I never like k-drama. Start from the language, the actor (their face almost all the same for me, hard to part them ?) until the story (sometimes for me k-drama is a little bit exaggerating). But i'll make exception for del luna. This is by far my most fav k-drama.

Del luna have everything i hope from drama. Story include mystery, friendship until romance. The romance itself not too much, just enough to make me say owh, cry & laugh.... :p.

The main couple relationship progress really smooth & excellent. The ending also really perfect to close this drama. The song really good makes me want to search & download. ^_^

Hopping there will be the second season.

It's been a while since a watch any drama, I was on a drama slump for about six month and ""Hotel Del Luna"" came to get me out of that dark place, so, with some tears still left in my eyes, here's what I have to say about this amazing drama.

My first impression of this drama was that it was beautiful from cinematography to costumes and even the special effects, and for a moment I was scared that this would be just another drama with amazing visual and no story to tell, but I was wrong, although is not the most perfect story it's definitively worth give it a shot.

This drama follows self-centered Jang Man Wol that as a punishment for a revenge that happened many years ago as to serve as a CEO to a peculiar hotel which's its guests are ghosts. Goo Chan Sung his just a normal guy who has his life turned around when he starts to work as a manager in Hotel Del Luna.

Although this drama has romance it's a very slow-burn one, plus this isn't really the main focus of the show in my opinion, I think it's pretty obvious that the show story it's about Man Wol and her growth, her path to be a better person at peace with herself. She is the most developed character with flaws and layers and IU's performance helped to bring this amazing character to life. Because of that Yeo Jin Go's character Goo Chan Sung was completely overshadow, even the good acting couldn’t save this, it was pretty obvious that Goo Chan Sung was only there so Man Wol had a reason to change, I think it was a shame he didn't get a better development . I like slow-burn romances, so I didn't mind the time they took to realize they loved each other.

The side characters had good stories to tell, stories that were worth explore in more depth and not in the last four episodes, I think they could have left some of the other guest stories and focus more in this one's, because for me there resolution felt a bit rush.

This drama main focus and moral of the story per say it's about forgiveness and the act of letting go, Man Wol journey it's about that and even the side character’s arc it's about letting go of the past resentment and move on. The theme of ""letting go"" and ""forgiveness"" are very well explored in this drama, and it's pretty obvious by the amount of emphasis they put on it. As the drama put it: it's harder to let go than to hold on.

The romance in this drama was cute and very slow-burn, as someone who loves a good slow-burn romance I didn't mind, plus I really liked that this drama switch rules, making the arrogant CEO with a soft heart a woman.

But, even with its flaws this drama is very entertaining to watch the balance between very dramatic scenes and the comedy it's well done helping this drama to be fun and easy to watch. Yes, this drama will probably make you cry, but it also will make you laugh within the same episode. Also as someone that spent six month without watching any drama, and got a bit used to the american format of 45 min episodes, each time I watch an episode from this drama I felt like I was watching a movie to be honest.

Acting/Cast: It's pretty obvious that IU stole the show for me, her portrayal of Jang Man Wol was almost perfect, the way she portrayed this very complex character and his growth throughout the show was impressive and I couldn’t imagined someone else in this, plus she is really pretty and seeing IU in such nice clothes in every episode was a sight to see. Yeo Jin Goo also did a good job, but the script really failed him, as didn't matter how good of an actor he is, his character was lacking something more memorable, but in the scenes he breaks down emotionally it feels raw and sincere. The supporting cast did a go job complementing the two main characters very well and also provided us with some comic relief and some interesting side-stories.

Cinematography: I don't usually have a separated topic just to talk about this, but this drama cinematography it's top notch and definitively deserves a topic of its own. The special effects were tastefully use and blend perfectly with a scenery around, the camera work and the color use were beautiful and combined with the editing created this drama gorgeous visuals. It's one of the most beautifully shot dramas I've ever watch.

I can't finish my review without talking about the beautiful OST full of very well-known names, this OST isn’t just good music but also the way they were included in the drama helped create beautiful and unforgettable scenes, plus I found new music to enjoy in my way to work.

Will I watch this drama again? Maybe, I really liked the drama and it was very entertaining to watch. Do I recommend it? Yes, if you like fantasy with a bittersweet ending, amazing cinematography and an amazing main character growth. I think this is a show to watch.

Regret not watching this sooner!
A mellowy, fun drama. What I loved most was the building romance between IU and Jin Goo. Their acting was very fun to watch. The OSTs are superb!!!!! 100/10 recommend just spending hours just like myself listening to them. A little advice I would say is while watching this one, don't judge the fiction part so much (actually cool but criticized upon) and just this rom-com! What I disliked about this drama I would say is the pacing which seemed a bit fast towards the end, as I would have liked a bit more from the middle portion of the plot and ending as well.

Brilliantly written, memorable characters
There is love in this drama, but not exactly the fluffy kind. The main attractions are the brilliantly written characters, most especially Man Weol, one of the most adorably imperfect creations in all of kdramaland, perfectly portrayed by IU. Ku Chan Song at first feels too perfect to be almost flat (and you will undoubtedly get a bad case of second-lead syndrome somewhere in the middle), but in the end you realize he is not really perfect but rather strong, and stable, and solid, exactly in the way Man Weol needs.

The tone, the mood, the way the story unfurls are all pitch-perfect -- just that right blend of dark and light, eeriness and warmth. Hotel del Luna feels both spooky -- a goth princess's daydream -- and a warm rest stop for lonely wandering souls, both in the drama and IRL.

My one complaint would be the totally unnecessary childhood/past life connection they had to add as the final twist in the end. The story would have been perfectly fine without it, IMO. All in all though, this is a sold drama, one of the best-written ones in a long while.

This drama is so good and fun, especially for IU fans. First of all, can I just say IU's outfits were FLAWLESS and she SLAYED?? Props to the costume person. I really liked the idea of this drama and it was really interesting. Personally, I loved her backstory and historical life with that guy ;) Maybe it's cuz I am a HUGE fan of historical dramas but that story was so interesting. As for the OSTs, every single song is so good and I have them saved to my Spotify playlist. The cinematography in this drama is so beautiful and amazing. The slow-motion scenes, the landscapes, the facial expression. All beautiful.

I thought IU did such a great job acting in this drama and she was so funny. As for Gu Cheon Sang, I can't believe he grew up this fast!! I knew him from playing the young king in Moon Embracing the Sun and now he's over here playing a lead role. He did pretty good too, but I thought his crying scenes were a bit awkward and funny. But it's okay!! He will improve and become better.

This drama is funny and clever and sweet and ugly and romantic and joyful and heartbreaking. Beautifully filmed, well acted, well written. Philosophical, with lots to think about andcca deeply satisfying resolution. I've watched hundredx of dramas and have only given a 10 rating to a handful. This drama is just that good. Those unsatisfied with the ending may be younger people unfamiliar with magic realism and symbolism. Often I am annoyed by the penchant of kdramas for forcing characters into reconciliation and understanding, but in this case it feels authentic and well earned. The drama's repeated references to Heidegger's Being and Time match well with the central theme of the drama.

Okay so I first heard of this drama when it was airing but I did not know if I was going to like it so I just watched it this past week. Here are my thoughts:

The story line is incredible, you go from the present to flashbacks/dreams of the past and it truly amazes me how everything in this scenes is truly important to the development of the characters. While the ending may be disliked by a few I think it is the best ending the drama could have had.
Characters:
I can say that I am not surprised I became attached to all the good characters, from Man-wol to fourth choice. I literally loved the chemistry between the two 'couples' that came to be during the drama. I was truly captivated by how well this characters where developed throughout the story.

I think once my heart has settled back down, maybe a year or so down the line I will come back and re-watch this drama because I do think is worth re-watching.

If you are looking for something that will have you on a roller coaster of emotions and will keep you up all night than this drama is definitely worth watching!!

IU was perfect, but I really need a second season with ...(spoiler)
Really nice, original story. IU was PERFECT, it took me a while to get used to Yeo Jin Goo, but I realized it might have been for his character - Goo Chan Sung wasn't my favourite at the beginning, but he fit the story, so now I'm okay with him.
Overall, there were many wonderful moments - especially those from the past, again, Man Wol was the best thing in this drama. The last few episodes were a bit prolonged, it felt as if they were just trying to kill time sometimes. To be honest, I would even be fine if Man Wol didn't come back in EP15, her leaving in EP14 fits her story in my opinion, I didn't really see the point of her coming back.
I have to say, this is one of few dramas where I'm actually glad that it ended how it did. Yes, it was sad, but it was for the best for everybody.
Okay, now let's put all that aside and talk about the end: Kim Soo-hyun aka the best thing about this whole drama. To provide some context, I'd finished 'It's okay to not be okay' just a while before watching the last episode, and I was literally screaming when he appeared, nobody else would fit there better - pure perfection.
The greatest gift that this drama has brought is the hope for a sequel with Kim Soo-hyun. Seriously, my greatest wish is a second season with him as the owner

""Hotel del luna"" was buzzworthy due to its cast and the visuals. They did a really really really great job with the costumes, especially with IU who was stunning. The make up of the ghost was good as well.

The horror part was just enough to keep things interesting (but be aware that some scenes are scary). The ghost stories were entertaining and enough to spice up the main plot. However, the romance was not that good. The love story was out of the blue, as they were more like friends rather than lovers. Sure, they had chemistry, but they just fell in love too suddenly. The background story of IU's character was pure gold and it was nicely presented, though.

So, overall, seven out of ten.

If you like Supernatural (American tv) this show hits all the right spots. Also if you like Master's Sun you would also enjoy this. The main show is a mix of campy ghost bits episode to episode with an overarching story with the main character that IU plays. It's a really well filmed/directed show and even the CGI is integrated well that it's just a good watch. The music was very well suited too.

I've been waiting for this show for a while since it's directed by the same director of While you were sleeping (one of my all time faves) and he didn't let me down. The writing however I was a bit disappointed that it was pretty much exactly what I expected since the ghost side stories felt very similar to Master's Sun. The upside is that all of the side characters were all very lovable (not a single overly annoying or over the top characters) and had pretty good handling/screen time unlike some of the other works by the Hong sisters. The main leads did justice to the overall theme and type of character they had but I didn't really feel the chemistry between them, so their eventual relationship wasn't my fave. I think the overall arc would still be equally good if YJG was just a devoted worker and not in love with her. However I hope that YJG gets a definitive happy ending in a drama soon. His dramas this year isn't that good for that lol.

So...I finished watching Hotel Del Luna last night...and I haven't stopped crying since then.
It is a very emotional drama,touches upon sensitive topics and teaches a lot.To be honest,in the end,I came to the conclusion that this is actually a sad drama.But oh so good
Let's go in parts:1-the acting:Oh my God everyone was literally perfect.IU's acting was amazing,I first came in contact with her acting in the netflix's mini series ""Persona"" and she was splendid and in HDL she was just the same,she was perfect for the role.It was my first time seeing Yeo Jin Goo and he was also amazing,they had perfect chemistry.The rest of the cast was also literally perfect for their characters.The way everyone portrayed them helped the drama be even more perfect
2-Story:I thought it was very creative and different,to me every episode was awesome.I've seen some people bothered by how long it took to show Man Wol's story,but to me, if they showed it all in the beginning, we would've been bored by the end of it,which wasnt the case,every episode we learned something new,and that is how you usually get to know someone,little by little.It was...perfect.If you like realistic endings,and by that i mean one that makes sense with the story and the characters personalities, this is for you.The ending was so bittersweet and reasonable with what should actually happen,and we knew since the beginning it would happen,but not in a predictable way,i actually thought the ending would be why usually happens in kdramas.It was the perfect ending to that storyline,if you wanted the cliche kdrama ending (you know,the ones where they're apart for like 2 or 3 years and then they meet again and stuff)I'm sorry,but you're not really getting that...not really...I guess.Enough about this,just watch it please hahaha.
3-Soundtrack:PERFECT.They managed to put every song in the perfect moment,and they were all so emotional and...really just perfect.Also the background musics were just as perfect.I'm sure I'll be listening to all of them for a long time.
4*bonus-THE WARDROBE OMGGG.Man Wol's clothes were so amazing,I loved every outfit she put on.As a fashion student,I can say that they did an amazing job,the majority of her outfits were a mixture of the first half of the 20th century and present days.I want to be her,I want her clothes,I'm so in love.
I think I'm gonna stop here,I actually thought about making a special part to those who have watched already to talk about how much my heart is heavy because of this drama,but if I change my mind I'll do it.
So,if you like fantasy dramas that touch upon very sensitive topics,and teach about a lot of things,give it a try.But i feel like I''ve lost a part of my heart,I feel like I've lost my friends and I miss them so much hahaha.I don't know if i talked about everything I wanted to talk about but you know...okay bye

Hotel De Luna is a must-watch drama. Jang Man-wol is an extravagant and beautiful, yet conceited owner of Hotel Del Luna. She is cursed to be the keeper of the hotel which caters to ghosts, to compensate for her sins.

The drama is captivating. You will instantly feel Man-wol's desperation for revenge. Man-wol portrays herself as a powerful and confident woman, but under her cloak is a woman trying to escape her sins, and desperately trying to live a good life. On the other hand, Ku Chan-sung is the perfect companion for Man-wol. Despite, Man-wol's constant caprices, and her ostensibly cruel personality, Chan-sung is always there to take care and accept her as she is. However, the overall plot fails to project on how to carefully unfold the secrets behind Man-wol's sins and her past.

Overall the drama is aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. The series is best for drama enthusiasts who love watching historical dramas. More so, with IU's top-notch acting with a mix of Yeo-jin Goo's charisma has made the drama a success.

This Drama is so unforgettable that gave me indescribable feeling. Definitely Masterpiece in All ways. ????❤️
The story line was new, refreshing and Unpredictable. It was filled with moments that were relatable, hilarious and heart breaking. Story of ghosts is also interesting and a little bit horror too. I had no idea about the plot... with Its unique storyline this drama captured my heart. ????
Strong part of the drama is IU's character, her fashion, expressions, reactions, her sassyness. Her story captivates you right from the start, causing you to be curious about her past, and eager to find out more.
Jin goo excels at every scene. He did his best too.The story of every character was explained thoroughly.And Everyone Acts so realistic.
Music was delightful. Background music is pleasant and specially, Song Done For me.
Even though I knew it was probably going to be sad but with plenty of twists and turns it keeps you on the edge. Great job,Outstanding cinematography, Acting and writing. Loved It ????❤️????

Eventhough the first four episodes could be a little boring for starters, it gets better and better til the end. So don’t skip this drama because honestly, you’ll regret it. And for those of you who is still in dilemma whether you’ll be watching or not because of the ending, don’t worry, it’s a happy end.

I never thought this drama could bring so much hidden emotions I never felt before when watching other dramas. I cried easily but never cried when watching the opening episodes (1-4) but watching this I realized how fast I was to cry. The drama was quite sad for me, but also happy at the same time. It shows beautiful goodbyes frequently in every episodes and I’m very satisfied with how all the “main characters” in the story each has their own stories to tell and somehow managed to relief and let go of their pasts eventually.

To sum this all up, I’d like to praise all of the directors for directing all the casts perfectly; the writers for writing such a beautiful story; and last but not least, the casts who played their role beyond excellently.

The first episode captivated me. It was beautiful and I definitely enjoyed it. But as the episodes went on, I became less invested in the story lines of the guests and more impatient to see man wol and chan sung's story, man wol's past.
What I liked about the show:
1) the acting. I'm a huge IU fan and I watched this show because of her and she absolutely convinced me of her character as the immortal man wol. Despite her being so young, she conveyed an ageless wisdom with her eyes.
I have not seen anything with yeo jin goo but I was blown away by his acting skills. He and IU had definite chemistry.
2) the ost. I might not listen to them as separate songs (done for me and another day being exceptions) but they definitely complemented the show.
3) cinematography was beautiful. It was charming.
4) the way the makers handled the plotline of the vengeful ghost of the young woman whose video was made viral. That was in my opinion the most interesting episode
5) loved the way ms.choi's arc was completed. Her arc touched me the most and her conclusion was beautiful.

What I didn't like:
1) the amount of time each guest would be given per episode. There needs to be a balance because we need the already present characters to develop too.
2) the way the arc of man wol's first love was handled. I think its because the plot of the show is a little similar to goblin but I couldn't help compare and appreciate how goblin handled the whole grim reaper and Kim shin confrontation better. Considering how man won spent 1300 years resenting this man who she believed to have betrayed her, the moment they finally met was so lackluster. It was like she felt nothing. No emotions at all. Just because she had found love with chan seung did not mean she could not have had one decent conversation with ko chung myung. Same goes with the reincarnation of yeon yu. I liked the way goblin handled the subject. How despite sunny not knowing her brother in her current life, he still managed to get to her. I would have liked to the main characters from that time 1300 years ago to have alteast one moment where they were togetger. The fact that there was barely any interaction made the 1300 years of wait seem like a childish thing whereas we know it wasn't. It was 1300 years of pain, anger, resentment, hate and self loathing. Not to mention that ko chung myung stayed with her as her first guest. But not even that is acknowledged by man wol. It was all kinda anti climatic. Given the build up. Also it kills me that man wol will never know that it was ko chun myung who brought back chan sung safely from the tunnel. I'm not saying that what ko chun myung did 1300 years ago was right. There were many ways he could have avoided the situation. But given that he more than paid for what he did, I expect more from when the two would finally face each other. Both having lived 1300 years with the past in their hearts.
3) the episode in which man wol gives the hair pin to vengeful ghost out for for chan sung. I get it. She thought he was the reincarnation of that man she had hated for 1300 years. But I kept thinking that she would not go through with it. That she'd come and save chan sung. But she didn't and was prepared to vanish. I think that was the only time I genuinely disliked man wol. And because that particular moment is never addressed again, I could never like man wol as much as did before. She would have gone through with it. She would have killed chan sung through that ghost and taken the coward's way out by vanishing. The fact that she couldn't stab chan sung when he offered her the dagger meant nothing to me as a viewer because man wol had already stated that the reason she gave the ghost the pin was because she could not kill chan sung herself. So why did her letting go of the dagger mean she was overcoming her hate when she really wasn't? I wish that this particular plot line had been handled better. Like man wol giving the ghost that pin so that it would finally come out into the open, confident in its new found power, while she secretly protected chan sung. They could have shown that she didn't tell chan sung to make it seem like chan sung had truly been abandoned and so they chan sung could go look for the ghost and be more believable about how he had been abandoned by man wol. They could have even shown man wol having a change of heart at the very last minute and showing that it didn't matter to her who chan sung was in his previous life. By showing that she gave the pin to the ghost and by not doing anything she showed that nothing had changed for her. I'm bringing goblin back into this because we saw the way Kim shin came to terms with grim reaper being the king's reincarnation and the way it was handled was beautiful. In hotel del luna, this was poorly handled in my opinion.

That being said, it was a good show with solid performances, good chemistry between the leads and I honestly do get the hype. And atleast this show did not shy away from showing some truly malicious ghosts (unlike Master's sun which made it seem like all ghosts were nice and not dangerous)

My absolute favourite moments would be when man wol reaches the tunnel where chan sung had mistakenly gone and runs to him when she seems him. That moment when man wol's cold exterior came crashing down and she felt true desperation will always stay in my mind. And secondly when man wol fights with ko chun myung and he talks to her about he had wanted to see her dressed as his bride, as she waited for him. How he would then reach out and touch her cheek. For some reason that scene hit me hard. I was all choked up because here she was, the girl he wanted to marry, dressed as the bride but holding a sword to his neck. That moment was strong and kudos to the actors for making it so. Third moment was when man wol returned after seeing off ko chun Myung and chan sung ran to her and just held her, not letting go for a second. the way he enveloped her in his arms and stood there, shaking, was a brilliant bit of acting.

As for the end, since I love happy endings, im going to stick with my interpretation: that chan sung and man wol met each other after they were reincarnated and they remembered one another (hence chan sung reading the book existence and time). I'd like to think that this particular blessing of remembering one another was a favour granted by the magos to the staff of hotel del luna for all they did to help the ghost guests. its also possible that chan sung was not reincarnated and man wol came in his current life time (which is possible since the show told us that time flowed differently beyond the bridge)since we don't see yuna in the park where everyone else is which is odd because everyone else was there. so I stick to happy ending version cuz I love happy endings

it had so many uncommon things on this series it was fun to watch like the story, IU's dressing style, OST, supernatural things, when I started to watch it gave a comfortable feeling like so I keept watching it. The romance part was good but I think they could do a better job

moral of the story??? if you love someone you also have to be able to lose her/him

Will Forever Stay With Me
The beginning of each scene was engaging and the plot that unfolds leaves you wondering what happens next. The storyline is very much like goblin so can't really say it's original but it was still interesting nonetheless. A lot of plotlines from the other characters and the ghosts from the hotel were thrown at me but I was more interested in finding out about Man Weol's past. I must admit that I did think the overall storyline of the drama was kinda confusing and even after finishing it there were still some things that didn’t make sense. I do think that the show spent too much time focusing on the storylines of the ghosts who would come into the hotel. Like sometimes they were interesting but I wanted to see more of Man Weol and Gu Chan Sung, damnit!

The CINEMATOGRAPHY is beyond beautiful. There wasn't a single seeing that wasn't any short of wonderful. Even the boring scenes we're nice to look at because of the amazing production that went into the sets.
The COSTUME DESIGN was exquisite. The main cast always looked good but IU's wardrobe was on another level. Her clothes matched her character so well. She definitely looks the part. Gu Chan Sung wore suits most of the time but hey you can never go wrong with a suit ;)

The ACTING was excellent(I figured if IU is in this it will be good), and the scenes between the Man-wol and Chan-sang were so enchanting to watch. Each interaction between them was truly captivating. I couldn't get enough of them both on the screen together. I love their chemistry.

The OSTs are literally so amazing I have no words. every song was right for the scene it was put in. The music truly transported you into the story as you were watching. Taeyeon's ""all about you"" and Paul Kim's ""so long"" are my favorites. Punch's ""another day"" was very good also. This is the first drama where I actually like all the osts.

OVERALL Many shows and movies talk about life and death, but nothing stuck with me the most than Hotel Del Luna. I appreciate this drama so much, I can not explain what it means to me. This show will always be stay with me, and I will force my future kid to watch it.

For those who are wondering to watch it, please do. Everything about this show is beautiful and is perfect!

I'm just after watching the last episode of Hotel Del Luna. I didn't expect him to have such strong emotions on me. The end of the drama is incredibly touching.
The IU's acting was, as always, at the highest level. She's one of my favorite Korean actresses and I'm incredibly glad she played the part of Yang Man Wol. She gave the show a lot of color. I also liked the movements of the camera and the whole scenery and costumes. It allowed for a great feeling of watching the show. The drama was very pleasant to receive. The action developed at the right pace. I didn't get the impression, as in some TV series, that something was missing me, or the episodes were not enough. Here everything was in its place and the story was superbly presented.
The most intriguing scene, however, was the scene after the subtitles. I am looking forward to the further development of the action and the release of the new season of Hotel Blue Moon.
I hope that it was well thought out and that in the near future there will be a continuation. I'm looking forward to it.

I don’t typically watch a lot of shows like this because the fantasy is a lot but I’m a sucker for a good romantic comedy and though this wasn’t fully intensely full of romance, everything about this story is amazing. Everything about this show was honestly amazing and beautiful; the effects, story, acting; it was great.

The story is about how the FL is bound to this death hotel due to grieving and revenge and it’s like the asian version of ghost whisperer if you’ve seen the American show; they’re helping people get into the light and pass on and be there. Then the ML comes along and he changes up the whole game, it’s cliche with the average Korean storyline when things line up but for some reason, something was so different about this. It was the connection between all the members and every story like wow my mind was blown.

I give credits to this whole cast, IU really stepped up but everyone’s acting was amazing and miraculous and this was worth binge watching because I think I just cried my eyes out a majority rules just because I felt the emotion.

I LOVED THE OST; WORTH EVERY SECOND.

I would watch this over and over and over. This was the drama of 2019, no fails on that one. Loved it.

This drama is beyond my expectation. Story' about ghost or dead is not something I was interested in before, but after watching this drama, I think my taste has changed. The idea of the story is not too special. The resentmant makes the dead won't like to go to afterlife then he or she should finish the undone mission. Inspite of the revenge, gaining the dead's dream of achiaving something can be so frutile which I never think before. The way to reach the goal can through an unpredictable way, funny and startling but yet it really touches or humanity sense.
The plot is consistent and strong. Though the idea is not something new but the execution can be so intriguing. The quality of the acting can be said as great advance.
Yeo Jin Go has a great talent of acting. I can say this after I watched the crown clown. In this drama he could create the nature of Kun Chang Soen as a fragile, smart but so sensitive guy. I love his acting. IU also makes this drama so fresh. She could bring the soul of resentment together with her redemption of love to Chang Soen.
I don't feel that the ghosts are really scary. Since it is not horror or thriller drama yet it hasil brought us to the conclusion that life is full of mystery and unpredictable ending.
Finally I can say the music can smoothly blend to the tone of each scene in drama. Though the end of this drama is heartbreaking but I can say it turns to a happy ending

Loved it!
Wow this is the best drama I've watched in a while! I can't believe I just let it sit in my to-watch list for so long... I was hooked throughout the whole drama. I also really loved the ending! I usually don't like drama endings but I think they ended this one well, I was very satisfied with it. It didn't feel rushed or anything. Also as a huge fan of Goblin I enjoyed this even more, it was fun seeing how the writer interpreted their version of life after death and the supernatural. I'm not the type to rewatch dramas but I would rewatch it with a friend or family member!

Plot/Storyline this drama:
I thought that the writing was pretty solid throughout the drama. It is refreshing to watch a drama that ventures into foreign territory and breaks free of the traditional kdrama tropes and cliches to explore the less commonly visited genres of horror (though I wouldn't really consider this drama to be scary at all) and fantasy + romance. The plot is layered and has some depth, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge. The main character Man Weol's story captivates you right from the get-go, as the show uses flashbacks very well to reveal small snippets of her past at a time, causing you to be curious about her past, and eager to find out more. The generous use of humour also helps to balance out some of the heavier, more emotional scenes, while also allowing the drama to be easy and fun to watch throughout its lengthy episodes. Personally, the ending did not play out exactly how I had hoped it would, but it was fitting to the themes of this drama and very beautiful to watch, as well as very emotional. The drama explores the themes/ideas of 'letting go', 'resentment', 'unselfish love' and 'forgiveness', which are all very meaningful, thought-provoking ideas, not just in the context of this drama, but these themes also have a place in our lives as well.

PLEASE TAKE IU AND YOE JIN-GOO FOR BLUE MOON . PLEASE HAPPY ENDING

ACTING: This is the first time I have ever reviewed a show no matter how good it was but for this show I have too. I was expecting it to be good because of IU. She is a phenomenal actor as well as Jin Goo. Her last works have all been good so I was expecting it to be amazing and boy was I pleased. When she cries, you can feel her pain. There not stiff actors or forcefully doing anything. Even the side charecters are doing amazing jobs at portraying there rolls and the chemistry is amazing.

The story itself is very unique and complicated at first. It all is starting to make sense and you don’t really expect any of it which is even better you get surprised and you are waiting wanting more. The description of this show doesn’t bring it justice. If you want to see a real show that’s not all about cute fluffy romance then this is the show. It does have romance in but it’s also focusing on lots of the side stories and there pasts which is very interesting.

The music is to DIE for. We have many of the OST’s by Punch who is a great singer. NCT’s 127 taeyong, Taeyeon, Monday kiz, Paul Kim and even IU herself and all of the songs are fantastic and I can’t stop listening to them. They fit the scenes perfectly.

Although this isn’t completed and we can’t guarantee what will happen at all I am hoping for a happy ending even though I’m not too sure if it fits the story that well especially since IU hasn’t had the best record of happy endings since I watched moon lovers: scarlet heart ryeo. I will Definitely be rewatching this when it is over.

Do not hesitate to watch this because it is not complete. I will be redoing my review and adding to it when it is over. Of course it has its fault like the non existent SLS I have even though there not really a second lead. Oops haha.

I rate this a 10 in everything so definitely recommend!!!

There's so much to say, but I'll try to be short.

I already knew from all the teasing before the show was aired how it was going to turn out: All about the cinematography and IU. I hesitated for a long time but I finally gave it a try for IU, she never deceived me in anything she did and she still hasn't, yet I'm dropping this one.

From the too much colored, unnatural filters and imagery to the lacking plot, every aspect of this drama feels soulless. It doesn't matter how good the acting can be, it can't save it. This drama suffer from wanting to do too much in term of production throwing pretty stuff at it. It's ok as long as the package looks good, right?

Well, not really.

The drama is pretty popular and has good critics and I can understand why. It can be a good drama if you're looking for entertainment only. But if you're looking for emotions, deep plot and something special and touching, this drama has no interest at all.

All the little stories about the ghosts aren't touching, how could they be touching in the 30 minutes the screenwriters allowed to them. The rest of the time is dedicated to the protagonists standing in front of a tree trying to somewhat pull out any emotions you would have developed toward them. But I wonder how such thing is even possible in this setting, at best you're feeling sympathy, it might be enough for some, not for me.

I don't have anything negative to say about the overall acting. They were all ok, good at best but mechanical, nothing to exploit in the character given to them. Yeo Jin Goo did a good job in what he was asked, his character being there for IU's to shine, nothing else. IU was as expected amazing, but what she can do when she has the only seemingly interesting character in the show?

The cinematography was beautiful but every scenes felt empty, special effects doesn't change anything when what's happening isn't even remotely engaging.

I had no expectations for this drama to begin with, I am not even disapointed. I am more annoyed thinking I could have enjoyed an another drama with IU but sadly it wasn't the case.

A brilliant creation, a must-watch for anyone
I cannot express my love for this drama enough. I just completed it today and omg what a ride this drama has brought us through. If some of your read my review from earlier on, I would like to say just one thing: I did not appreciate the OSTs enough back then as I do now. Now that I have been through a whopping 16 episodes with the amazing cast of Hotel Del Luna, everything about is to admire; the original storyline, amazing cast, the talented screenwriters (Hong Sisters thank you!) and the crew who have worked behind the scenes, you have made this drama into a masterpiece and one that I know will forever stay fond in my memories. I personally loved the storyline of Man Wol's past as it does a great job in telling us why Man Wol is the person she is today. And Chan Seong, I love you but Chan Myung stole my heart. The love story between him and Man Wol is the most bittersweet thing ever (kind of like Romeo and Juliet but not). The whole drama with the exception of the last two episodes is basically a build up to episode 14, the most critical and best episode of the drama.

With that being said, I felt that episode 15 and 16 were rather boring but still essential to ensuring that we come a full circle in terms of the plot line. Episodes 15 and 16, I personally thought, focused more on wrapping up the supporting characters' lives but episode 16 was much needed as we bade farewell to the hoteliers and CEO Jang Man Wol herself. As Man Wol left, I understood what she had been through those 1300 years and as she turned around on the bridge and smiled with the white flower in her hands, I almost cried. At the same time, I LOVED how they wrapped everything up. Episode 14 brought important closure to no one other than our main character, Man Wol, and the man she had been waiting for all these years, only to know that he's been with her all along. THAT WAS SO SWEET. Also the fact that she finally comes to realize why Chan Myung had done what he had - sacrificed himself to save her - OMG I could not hold back my tears. In that moment, all that vengeance and hatred she had for him completely dissipates and it was really nice to see them part with good feelings (the scene under the Moon Spirit Tree where they both hold back tears in their eyes while looking at each other and Chan Myung's smile oMg nothing else could have ached my heart more). One last thing I should mention is the symbolism. GOSH the symbolism - it's EVERYWHERE.

Overall, this drama is a brilliant creation; a must-watch for anyone and everyone :)) !!

This show captivated me in multiple ways. In the backstory, I enjoyed that which is why I gave story an 8 as I loved what made Man Wol who she is. You start to understand the character through IU's acting which is AMAZING as IU was the perfect role for this and nobody can replace her as she played Man Wol perfectly. If you are watching/watched this show you would understand what I mean by this as she plays the perfect calm Man Wol to the infuriated to emotional as there were many expressions that were enjoyable. The rest of the cast was really good to as I enjoyed many other roles as I was even crying through some parts of the show.

The OST in this show is beautiful as I loved the music that would queue whenever there was a sad scene. The music was perfectly times in my opinion as it helped people feel the emotions.

I can't really see myself rewatching it any time soon but maybe in a few months, who knows?

Don’t get me wrong, this drama was a fun watch. I loved a whole lot of things about it. From its OST, to the premise (who the hell can actually think of a hotel for ghosts???) and the acting, Damn the acting. It’s just that the writing had its ups and downs.

The up? Every story of a visiting ghost was a treat to me. I enjoyed seeing how the hotel solved their problems in the most human way possible, because afterall, they are humans... just dead.

The down? The love story and the shift in focus let me down gravely. They’ve been building up the Man Wol - Chong Myeong story since the beginning and to have it end sadly with Man Wol leaving him by the bridge to after life... what the hell was that for? I mean, did we forget that this guy chose to live as a glow in the dark insect for 1300 years only to be forgotten because of a new, way younger guy she had a few meals with??? I do love chan sung’s character, and I rooted from them at the start, but it was always the flashbacks that dominated the course and mood of the story for me. To make that grudge disappear too quickly was really just... lousy writing.

Other than this huge disappointment, I loved the drama. Sadly I ended it without rooting for the couple they wanted to close the story with. Sigh

A magical show with lots of exciting twists
9/10 is my rating. This is a 2019 South Korean tv drama with 16, 90 minute episodes. Hotel del Luna is a hotel located “in” Seoul. It is not visible to just anyone and undergoes a complete transformation when night falls. Kang Man-wol (Lee Ji-eun) became the “boss” of the hotel when she was transporting some souls of people she killed to the hotel in an effort to make up for her actions. She is unable to find it until she drinks a mysterious liquor which curses her to be the proprietor of this hotel for ghosts. She had run the hotel for over 1,000 years when a human wanders in which is normally a death sentence. However he strikes a deal with her to give her his son 20 years in the future in exchange for his life. Ku Chan-Seong (Yeo Jin-goo), was raised by his father to avoid Man-wol and her employees and even lives outside of South Korea until he deems it safe to return. Avoiding his fate may not be that simple and he soon finds being the hotel‘s new manager may be a job he cannot refuse.

Spoiler 🚨 This was written by the Hong Sisters who have written other good dramas like ”Master’s Sun” and ”You are Beautiful“. They definitely know how to tell a good story. It is somewhat reminiscent of ”Goblin“ In that it has a delightful blend of spiritual and magical. It also has magical and ghostly elements like ”Master’s Sun”. I liked all the main characters and thoroughly enjoyed getting to know each one and their back story. It was like ”Beauty and the Beast” in the way their relationship was transformative. Both leads were really gorgeous and their chemistry was really amazing. I would have given an even higher score but I’m not one that likes sad endings. It will be sad for some but for others it will not be. A lot depends on your beliefs and your own personal philosophy. If you like paranormal with twists of magic then you will really enjoy this one. I think everyone would enjoy it most of the way through. If you do not expect happily ever after it is easier to understand.

Aesthetically very pleasing
For the first 8 episodes I thought I would definitely give this drama a 10. The acting was great, the shots and editing was fantastic and IU's wardrobe was simply stunning. It was a joy to watch. At the same time, the characters seemed interesting, the ghost stories got me involved and both the present and the past storylines were equally enganging which doesn't happen often. However, close to the end the drama was getting worse and worse and it was mainly due to the script as the actors themselves were definitely top notch. The plot became all over the place, their problem resolutions were totally unsatisfiying and for the last few episodes it wasn't even interesting to watch anymore. The glaring problems with the script became evident and even the beautiful sites couldn't hide them anymore (20+ hours of just stunning aesthetics with no meaning is definitely too much). The only well developed character was that of Jang Man Wol, even Gu Chan Sung was underdeveloped and existed mainly as a plot device to JMW's character. It was also advertised as a rom com but I definitely did not get the feeling that it was. It was quite funny and unlike many others I don't have complains that the main couple did not have chemistry, they did it was just completely different. More of a mature romance / deep friendship than cute head over heels romance. For me the drama could have ended on episode 15 and nothing would have changed much as for the storyline itself. There was no resolutions or questions left to be answered in the last episode, just unnecessary scenes that couldnt even decide whether it was to be sad or hopeful or what. I was left unsatisfied with the development and the direction it has taken. The only reason why the score is so high is that production value and acting was through the roof.

As my headline, Kim Soo Hyun ending the show, can we just let our hearts burst? Why was he so fucking sexy, though??
When he stood on the steps and just looked like a freaking god, I felt every part of me being on fire.

Also, can we just take a minute to thank Sulli for her last ever appearance in drama before her passing. Rest in Peace, sweetie.

Now to the important stuff, I adore IU, but this show hasn't gotten the right appreciation for the males in the show.
Yeo Jin Goo, Pyo ji Hoon, Shin Jung Keun, Kang Hong Suk, Lee Do Hyun, Lee Tae Sun and Jo Hyun Chul.

I'm going through each of the males because I have a lot to say: (Also I'm saving the ones I have most to speak to the last).

Sanchez (Jo Hyun Chul): I felt for him when he lost his girlfriend. Honestly, I thought she was cheating or something. Most of the time, I felt like he was very much in love with his girlfriend, who also seemed imaginary, but when Chan Sung sees her in Sanchez house and knowing that she's already gone, Oh my lord my heart almost combusted because I felt for him, and her. And I realized it was a great side storyline; it made me very sad for Sanchez, though.

Sa Shin (Kang Hong Suk): Honestly, this grim reaper is like the most compassionate I've ever seen (Well, let's not talk about Lee Dong Wook's Grim reaper in Goblin). Sa Shin is most definitely in the same league, but also, I like how he had a funny side to him, especially when he was drinking with Sun Bi.

Kim Sun Bi (Shin Jung Keun): Okay, this back story had me so sad, how he was screwed over and made to look like not con artist but a fraud. Having his past cleared up and for him to move on. And also to be a hell of a bartender.
He was one of the funniest, always putting his foot in it, and being proud thinking he's done so well.

Ji Hyun Joong (Pyo Ji Hoon): I want to give him a big applaud. We've been told his entire story from the beginning, and he had his goals, but when he falls for the soul trapped inside the body of Yoo Na. They are adorable, he's funny and very supportive towards her because she's supposed to be dead. But he also has a goal that when his sister dies, he'll pass over with her, and that broke my heart so hardcore.

Yun Woo (Lee Tae Sun): This death was like the worst one for sure. I cried with him, and I cried with Man wol, who cried for him. He was the best brother and friend to her, and he loved her as only a sibling would, yet they weren't related, but he really proved that family isn't based on blood. But how you treat someone. And the fact that Man Wol gets to meet him in the present time and he's dating her enemy, that even made me angry. I wished for Man Wol and Yun Woo to have more interaction in the current time. But she only really looks over him, but I can tell she wants more but never takes the step for it. And the fact that he finds her familiar breaks my heart.

Go Chung Myung (Lee Do Hyun): Can we just take a minute, I have to have a minute.

The fact that he stayed next to Man Wol for those thousands and thousands of years. Because he loves that much, it got me so hard. It makes me teary-eyed just thinking about it. Their story was one that really grasped me, no matter how much he had to hurt her, it was so obvious how much loved her. Even when he betrayed her, he did everything for her sake, when he had Yun Woo's life taken away it was all to protect Man Wol, and their love story breaks me because she hated him for all that time. And just wanted revenge, when he was there watching her hate him. He took his punishment just to be close to her. I had the theory that Chan Sung was the reincarnated Chung Myung, but it was just Chang Myung showing the man that was about to fall in love with the love of his life why she's like she is. Chung Myung is the hero of this drama for sure. And his love made me really fall for this drama—also the right actor for the role.

Goo Chan Sung (Yeo Jin Goo):
To start with, I felt like Jin Goo wasn't really right for the role, but at the same time, now one couldn't have done this role as well as he did. (I think he looked way too young for the age he was trying to portray). As I said earlier, I thought for a long that Chan Sung was Chung Myung, and by the looks of it, so did Man Wol, even though she hoped it wasn't so. She was right. But Chan was really the start of the drama, he showed compassion, reality checking, optimism. Also, he was a hell of a good friend to his friends. It's sad he had been slandered and hurt before, but it also made him into Chan Sung. The fact that he helps Sanchez see his dead girlfriend for the last time, and also comes to terms with the tiger and being able to see ghosts. And the fact that he'd go to heaven to see Man Wol if he had too. He becomes a beacon and is really the hero of the show.

I'm noy going to lie, love IU as a fiesty woman, she really made me happy this show. (The whole Scarlet heart feel, but a bit more bitter.)

Haunting, Enchanting, and Incredible
My goodness, IU, and co-star Jin-goo did such an incredible job! The production felt so clean and exquisite, and each of Jang Man-wol's outfits was astonishingly beautiful. I was hooked from the very beginning, and the drama perfectly balances romance, fantasy, comedy, and soul. Many of the side characters had touching backstories, and I'm so happy the writers gave them each a satisfying ending! The OST soundtrack was one of the most memorable things from the drama, HEIZE and Chungha (to name a few) did a fantastic job adding a haunting and emotional touch to the deeper scenes. Easily one of the best dramas I've seen by far!

All the cliches, but backwards. Yes, please, and thanks. That's all I needed. Not to mention, thanks to this drama I know Yeo Jin Goo exists, and I'm so thankful for that! To be honest, the Hong sisters deserve all the awards for this drama. I just honestly really like the main female and male characters and how they were written. The actors are insanely beautiful and their chemistry is so beautiful too. They give me this behind the scenes vibe. You may not see them interacting with each other all lovey dovey during the entirety of the drama, but YOU KNOW the two have grown seriously close as the episodes/days/time passes in the story. They are a breath of fresh air in the Korean drama spectrum. Point is, I personally felt very satisfied watching this. I am making plans to re-watch it for the FOURTH time SOON.

Creative and visually stunning, but a few steps short of perfection . . .

The set-up and mythology is very different and fun to watch. From the idea of a ghost inn, to a goddess with many avatars/faces, to the beauty & the beast type romance with the genders switched. I was blown away for the first eight episodes.

But, while the historical plots tie up nicely, the modern storylines were wrapped up quickly with no real suspense making the last couple episodes complete filler.

As to actors/characters, two of the main female characters are complex and multifaceted: Jang Man-Wol and the Goddess Mago. But, the main male character Koo Chan-Seong is especially flat and uninspiring as the person who always does the right thing.

The music fits well with the show, but it doesn't linger in my memory. There were no special scenes that I feel the need to rewatch.

I grade on other criteria as well:

Complex Themes: 7.0
The biggest letdown of the show. The theme is letting go leads to peace, and you should do it, even if terrible things happened to you while alive. But there isn't a complex inspection of this, forgiveness is just always the right thing to do - and always works out for the characters that do it.
Character Growth: 8.0
The transition from vengeful to letting go is especially touching for Jang Man-Wol, the housekeeper and the receptionist. It's a shame that Koo Chan-Seong gets no complexity or real transition at all. There are also very short, abrupt plot points for the bartender, Sanchez, and Lee Mi-Ra.
Complex Female Characters: 10.0
Jang Man-Wol is great playing vengeful and cynical, with a romantic heart. She is fascinating throughout the show as she develops increasing humour and sensitivity. A very well-rounded character. The housekeeper and the Goddess Mago also have great complexity. Indeed, generally the female characters and storyline were much better developed and well-rounded then the male ones.
Cinematography/Production Values: 10.0
It's gorgeous. Truly the most beautiful TV show I may have ever seen, the colour palette is vibrant and unusual, the clothes budget for Jang Man-Wol must have been unlimited, and there's a beautiful use of camera angles, movements and framing. It has a very stylistic, fairy-tale feel.

Original storyline and fantasy
I rarely enjoy imaginary stories and acts, however, this drama was just way too aesthetically pleasing and pretty that I couldn't help but finish it all. I remember watching it and waiting for the upcoming episodes impatiently.

I'd lie if I say I wasn't surprised by Yeo Jin-goo's acting; the role he had in this drama was so sensitive and I am so happy by the outcome.

We can't forget IU's costumes and how expensive she looked througout the entire drama.

I want to talk about the beautiful OSTs that were brought up by this, below are only some of them (my fav):
- Taeyeon (태연) - A Poem Called You 그대라는 시
- Heize (헤이즈) - Can You See My Heart 내 맘을 볼수 있나요
- Chung Ha (청하) - At The End 그 끝에 그대
- Song Haye (송하예) - Say Goodbye
- Gummy (거미) - Remember Me 기억해줘요 내 모든 날과 그때를
- Ben (벤) - Can You Hear Me 내 목소리 들리니
- Yang Da Il (양다일) - Only You 너만 너만 너만

I loved this drama. Even though i loved it i gotta recognize that it's not perfect at all. I geniunely couldnt give less of a fuck about some of the casts storylines for example P.O's and Kang Mina's characters ( i can't remember their charas names at all lmaoo) and P.O's acting was cringy as hell most of the time and so was mina's sometimes. Also even though i really liked Chan Sung i can admit that he is kind of a boring character and and that Man Weol truly stole the show, her personality, her outifts and IU's acting just were too good but i still loved the main couple, to me they had really good chemistry and worked together pretty well. Also, i didn't really give a shit about Chung Myung at all but what they did with his storyline at the end was kind of wack, he deserved better ngl. But even with the bad stuff and shit i still really liked this drama a lot, i even cried at the end lmaoooo

Omg. IU. If I know nothing about k-ent, I wouldn't have thought she is first a singer, she's such a good actress now. That's so commendable, she's come a long way from her early acting days from Dream High and Producers. She persevered to better her craft, as there are lots of idols who are casted leads year after year but we've yet to see improvement.

Even some actors I fell in love with at first, but once they hit it big, they seem stagnant or disengaged from acting as they move from one project to another. She certainly held her own against acclaimed actor Yeo Jin Goo (who is good as always), and she even shone more because Jang Man Weol is a role of a lifetime.

The relationship of JMW and KCS was what I wished IOTNBO romance to be with the tortured heroine and good hearted hero, albeit I wished they had more romantic chemistry like IOTNBO leads, then it would have been perfect.

I really love the role reversal here. YJG even have that tropey damsel in distress scene, he puts himself in danger, and JMW has to save him all the time lol. The cases are otherworldly but heartfelt, and tackle how we all deal with the pains of grief, forgiveness, acceptance, and letting go.

Spoilers to follow:
The ending was sad, but it actually fits with the message of the drama, and I appreciate that the overall outlook the drama wants to leave is still hopeful and positive, despite all the goodbyes. I would have loved if it ended with JMW on the bridge to the afterlife looking back, happy and fulfilled, with no more burdens. The drama is balanced overall, but Jang Man Weol is Hotel Del Luna, and it is she who we will remember it by.

One of my favorite 2019
10++++ really didnt want it go end hope they'll be a 2nd season. Previously finished and forgot to review this amazing drama. I have not seen one like it. It funny, sad, full of mystery and of course the scify part being able to see and talk to ghost helping them crossover peacefully. I was always waiting for the next episode. The cast choice couldn't of been selected. You could feel the chemistry beginning with Jang man wool and goo Chan sung. He never gave up on her and found out what happened 1000years ago and how his family is involved.
.What a way to end. This has been so far one of my favorite drama around for 2019.
A must see for all. 👍🏻

I saw many people posted about Hotel del Luna on Facebook so I decided to watch it. It was definitely worth watching. There were twists you wouldn't expect. IU's outfit were to drool for. The cast was great. Everyone played their roles very well. You can laugh, be in love, and cry while watching the drama. Its definitely a must-watch.

Overall an entertaining, amusing drama. Love the acting from IU and Jingoo, side characters were also good and had interesting backgrounds. It took me a while to finish it because the episodes were too damn long, lol. I think I would've tried to cut it a little shorter? but regardless, I enjoyed the drama and story. Hotel del Luna has almost no romance (compared to what I thought it would have) so it's a good thing. Manwol's character was great too, very different from most female main characters I've watched. I'm really looking forward to seeing more from IU in the future!

Not horrible.
This drama would've been heaps better had they focused on Man Wol's story. It was compelling and got me interested in the drama. But they didn't spend as much time as I would've liked. I'm okay with the backstory of the other ghosts in the hotel, they were cool and I liked them enough. But I spent a lot of my time just wondering when they'll get back to addressing Man Wol's origin.

I also didn't feel attached to the male lead. It's not a slight to Yeo Jin Goo at all, but he didn't have any chemistry with IU, at least in my eyes. I liked Lee Do Hyun better.

IU was awesome though, as usual. She's a fantastic actress.

Overall, will I rewatch this drama? Probably not. I haven't found myself wanting to, not even for a specific scene. It's not horrible, not bad, but not great. The emotional moments didn't hit as hard as I wanted them to, and I didn't get attached to a lot of the characters. I don't remember any standouts from the OST either, but it didn't annoy me.

Visually beautiful, but slow plot
Mixed feelings about this drama.

The good:
1) IU's acting is so good! I'm a huge fan. The heart of this show is, without a doubt, IU. She stole every scene she was in. I also loved her outfits. I really felt for her - her past and current self.

2) Main plot was really solid. The flashbacks to the past, Jang Man-wol's past, all of that was really compelling. I loved her story with Go Chung-myung, and her familial relationship with Yeon-woo.

3) This show is absolutely beautiful. The set designs, the cinematography, the outfits... absolutely beautiful.

4) I love Sanchez.

The bad:
1) Too much filler episodes. Each episode basically comprises of about 70% 'ghost of the week' and 30% Man-wol's past/flashback to the past. Some of the ghost side characters had really poignant stories. The rest, I really didn't care much about. I only see them for about an hour, then they're gone forever. Also, Man-wol's past is fascinating and compelling, and it ended up being frustrating that I couldn't find out more about it until the end.

2) I did NOT buy Gu Chan-sung's romance with Man-wol. I was way more invested in her and Chung-myung. I felt for him and his failed and tragic romance with her. They really seemed like doomed star-crossed lovers. The minute Chung-myung appeared, I kind of switched ships. I saw Chan-sung as Man-wol's brother and started skipping their romantic scenes because I just wasn't filling in. Chung-myung made a way more compelling love interest. Sadly, the writers obviously did not think so.

3) Side characters that were never developed or fleshed out. Unfortunately, I didn't care about most of the sideplots or side characters. They barely got any screen time.

4) Gu Chan-sung has no personality outside of being in love with Man-wol. He ends up functioning as an impetus for plot stuff to happen, with no real presence of his own. His character was quite poorly written - he did not feel like a main character.

First of all - I had pretty high expectations for this one. And while the acting (but it was obvious to me that I would like it with this cast) and the whole production were superb, i felt like the lack of chemistry between the two male leads didn't exactly help me root for them. I also felt like the impact of Jang Man Wol's past on the story was downplayed in the end. Another thing that bugged me were the weird jump-cuts that appeared sometimes. Other than that, I did enjoy watching this drama and I will probably continue to listen to the instrumental osts, because the background music in this one was just... wow. You have to search up ""Long and Far"" on yt, it's just such an amazing piece

I found the plot to be pretty good, but the ending was just so sad to me. I went to sleep and woke up sad because I was so sad from the ending that I had a sad dream too. I love the acting and the visuals of the drama are just absolutely amazing. The story conveyed was really good to me as it was heartfelt, but the problem is that now, every time I think of this drama, I get sad, and every time someone in another drama dies, I think of this drama. The thing about the ending that made me so sad is that everyone left, and seeing the empty hotel made me feel really down. Although it is expressed that they meet again in their next lives, for me, I'm still left with the impression that the main characters did not end up together. However, on a happier note, I felt like there was character growth, and I definitely don't regret watching this drama because I feel that it is a beautiful drama despite how sad it made me. So I'd still recommend this drama.

Best all time fav sci fi series with amazing vfx and animation. Every single thing appears to be real when it presented in such a way that I felt in love with this drama. Gu chang sang caught my heart never ever saw a perfect guy like him in my life. He waS always able to catch the eye of audience rather the main plot revolves around IU and ghosts. IU's cuteness is out of this world and her dressing sense was irreplaceable. Her gesture of playing with people and power was divined in a whole package. Please watch this drama its a gem to our not so meaningfull life.???

I love supernatural dramas. This is a very interesting story with a very unique plot. After watching a few episodes I am hooked.

I love the story and how each episode has a back story. You can get hooked to all the side line characters and feel sympathy and happiness for each one.

I definitely recommend this drama to all supernatural story loving fans who look for different emotions in a drama, like fear, sadness, happiness, anger, excitement and amusement. I am looking forward to seeing more episodes soon.

Dropped after 3 and a half episodes
In Hotel Del Luna, Yeo Jin-Goo plays Koo Chan-Sung, an elite hotelier cursed to endlessly gesticulate without ever expressing an emotion. He has so little presence that I sometimes forgot he was in a scene while it was still playing.

The titular hotel has even less presence. The staff magically teleport around its diverse interiors (a composite of sets and real locations), which means it never acquires the immersive quality of the Overwatch or the Grand Budapest, or the café in Coffee Prince.

A combination of frenetic editing, dutch angles, and stylised lighting gives the jarring impression of watching a music video, even in moments that should be quiet and lyrical.

The story moves with perverse slowness, sadistically withholding from the viewer the fantastic tales and sights that it could offer. At the point where I dropped the show, Koo Chan-Sung had only just joined the hotel's staff.

I would have liked to learn more about IU's past ( she is far and away the highlight of the show ), but I suppose I'll never know.

(By the way, shouldn't it be 'Hotel de la Luna'?)

This review might contain implied spoilers.

I came to watch this without really knowing what the premise of the story is. I had heard all the buzz about the show when it was first airing but I did not watch it then, and I'm kind of glad I held off because this show is honestly binge-worthy. In the first episode I wasn't really sold on the story yet, but I kept watching because I liked stories that put twists into the whole idea of a purgatory and an after-life. I don't regret watching this show at all. Although it took some time to get attached, I ended up being hooked when they showed flash-backs of a character's previous life. This naturally made me curious, and kept me coming back for more and more episodes because I just wanted to know what happened and how things ended up the way they are. There were some developments within the relationships of some characters that felt almost rushed and out of the blue, but in the grander scale of things I think this can be disregarded because the writers go out of their way to explain and build on these throughout the show.

One of the themes that I really enjoyed seeing, other than the romance and comedic moments in the show, was this idea of found-family. I don't think it was particularly emphasized until the last couple of episodes when things were starting to come to a close, but nonetheless the writers really did a good job to show that there is growth and love to be found in these connections. Another was the feeling of 'moving on'. I think grief in many different forms was addressed here, both in negative and in positive ways. It was nice to see the characters learn through others' experiences, and find in their own ways how to deal with their past that might've given them many negative feelings.

If anything, the part of the show that I loved the most was the end. There's always this sense of unease when it comes to drama endings because sometimes they are not done well or there is something left to be desired. I really enjoyed seeing the show come to a close through the last few episodes because the writers really take you through it in a way that doesn't leave you going ""What? That's it?"". You know it's going to end soon, characters have their last appearances on the screen and you KNOW it's their last appearance. Everyone gets an ending, and to me, each character got the ending they were set up to have. It was incredibly heart-warming (and I admit, I shed many tears) to see these characters - these people who have lived for many years with negative feelings tying them down to the living world, leave with ease and smiles on their faces. I also really appreciated that little cameo at the end... ;)

I think for me, the MVP of the show is Sanchez. He went through so much as the show went on, but it was really nice to have this consistent character be there for Chansung.

Overall, I'd recommend this show. I loved it. From the production quality, to the story which may seem simple at first but eventually builds on its own, and the characters. It's funny, it's wholesome, sometimes it's a little scary and the romance is nice. Oh yeah, and most importantly, Lee Jieun. She is a goddess on earth, I swear.

Shoutout to the stylists of the show. They did an amazing job on IU's fashion, I was just heart-eyes the entire time.

A message that I stubbornly refuse to accept
god damnit, first Moon lovers , now this! i keep getting baited into watching dramas with bittersweet or tragic endings!!! DAMN YOU YOUTUBE COMPILATION MAKERS!!!

i was so sad when i realized she is just going to go to the afterlife on the bridge :(

the goddess kept saying time will flow again, i thought she meant her time continue after the tree disappears and she will grow old and die. But wth man, this ending really bummed me out.

even the end where he sees her ghost through the book he is reading, its so painfully depressing knowing she is nothing but an illusion, knowing full well she already passes on to another life.

Maybe that is what this story is trying to teach, but sorry, im even more weak hearted than Goo Chan Sung................ damnit.


Other than these feelings, the show is shot beautifully and the acting is also good enough. Everything was amazing, if not for that end i personally don't prefer.

I am so in-love with the OST's
The storyline is very great because of the imagination of fantasy world relating to the realm. Both IU and Jin Goo portrayed their role really well especially IU (one of the best actress in the industry). I am so in-love with the OST (all OST especially All About You by Taeyeon and At The End by Chungha) Highly recommended drama for the one's who wants to watch a fantasy filled with extraordinary concepts and romance blended with.

Im a fan of the supernatural but was a lil skeptical since i hate imposible relashionship/love, but this wasnt one of those moves.

We were all expecting that ending. We all know they have met before andthey will meet again in the future. The ending was a lil dragy but i enjoied this series from begining to end, there was no any useless fillers lol. Death is natural and im happy they accepted it and didnt do any cliche ending.

In my opinion it wasnt really about love but about death, it was about putting ms moon to rest. i personally didnt feel a strong love feeling from the story/actors. But it was a beautiful story.

My fav OST of this drama is Done for me by Punch, and wow, the lyrics says everything anytime the sound played in the series, it gave me the feels.

Okay! I have a lot to say about this drama! First of all, I am never going to forget Jang Man and this drama is one of IU's best acts! (She has slayed in each and every character of hers!!) There's no doubt of giving this a 10! This drama is an overall masterpiece!! Really everything in this drama deserves a 10! Production, acting, VFX, OST Tracks literally everything in this drama deserves a 10! You are going to regret it badly if you don't watch this drama!!
(Believe me, I usually think a lot before giving a drama 10 out of 10 and there's no doubt of giving this drama a 10 because it's great!!

I loved this show! It was amazing. The visuals and the story line behind each episode was perfect. I think all the actors had amazing chemistry, they all seemed to compliment each other well. I didn’t know who IU was until this show and OMG her acting was perfect. I wonder if she’s like this in real life! Lol. There isn’t anything bad I can say about this show. I wish they come out with a second season and bring some of the cast back in not as vengeful ghost but as a cast still being alive to help out in a way with the owner, and I wish they give us a little more about man wol and Chan sung and all the others with there happy endings.

This is a supernatural, fanstay, drama, ghost, life, friendship kind of story. The setting of the story is really pretty. The clothes, hair and makeup of everyone is pretty too. The hotel was super pretty. The show is super emotional in a good way. The main girl and guy had great chemistry together. I love the supernatural elements to it. I don’t normally like many stories that have ghosts in them but I loved this one a lot. All of the ghosts were different and unique. I was always surprised at what the next ghost would look like and do. Some of the ghosts were more like horror characters. While some were more cute , more friendly, almost kid tv like ghosts in a way but not like Casper the ghost in a other way. When the main girl kissed the man dude for the first time I couldn’t believe it. There were so many rooms in the hotel that houses so many different kinds of things so I never got bored with what was happening in the hotel. There was always something new to discover about the hotel. I loved the fact that since she had lived for thousands of years we get to see her during some of the past decades at times while seeing her in the modern times. I also loved every characters personality. When that had the soul wedding that was very difference then anything I have ever seen. Until watching this show I never even heard of a soul wedding. But I thought it added interest in the show. It was funny when he would talk to ghost sometimes and people would heard him say things and do certain movements but not be able to see the ghost like he can. I love how the tree represented how the ceo lady was doing at the moment like the happy and better off she was the tree would be becuse prettier and prettier until it died meaning it was time for her to leave for the after life finally. I would recommend this story to everyone for sure. You might not think it good at first but trust me it so freaking good that it a ten star for sure from me. I might even rewatch the show one day that how good it is.

A MUST WATCH !! One of the best dramas of 2019.It was Exciting, Mysterious, Heart Breaking,Horror yet full of adventure. All the elements of horror, funny, romance, sad and mystery are blended well.In simple story about Jang Man Wol they added plenty of different yet meaningful short stories about dead people's life .IU's acting was superb, her gestures, her face expressions, her gaze and the way she talked really astonishing she is SPLENDID..!!???????? Yeo Jin Goo was Cute & he had done great job.All the supporting cast was superb!!! After IU the soul of this drama is Its Music, Ost's are on point & its cinematography !!! i'm mesmerized by this drama.Happy to see Lee Joon Gi even for a short time.????

I really wanted to like this more then I did
I'll be honest here, I watched this story because IU was in it, and I stayed because her acting and characterization of Man Wol were just that good. But, beyond that, the plot of this drama lacks in many ways. I never felt the dreading of Man Wol leaving because honestly, there wasn't much suspense behind it. I knew very well that it was going to be a happy ending and that they were going to reunite. But my problem isn't that it was a happy ending, it was that the writers made it so painfully obvious that it was. I mean...at least give me some suspense here.

The side character plots were good, it was something I could tell would happen from the first episode. But, I just wished they put more thought into the side characters' backgrounds and their purpose for staying. All of it just felt so lackluster compared to Man Wol's story. You may think that because Man Wol is the main character her story should be the best one, and yes that is true to some point. But when the side characters' story takes up nearly 80% of the show at least put some thought into them.

In addition to that, the romance in this story was also a bit lacking. Let me be frank here, I genuinely really (x10) wanted to like GCS and MW together. They were adorable and they just had really nice interactions. But then GCM comes into the picture and I just couldn't follow the story of GCS and MW anymore. The old Man Wol from 1300 years ago and the GCM who loved her was such a beautiful story and their chemistry was just explosions for me. Their story was the only thing that kept me wishing for the next episode, the next scene, the next flashback. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made me curious about what happens next.

For GCM, they honestly didn't develop his background or story enough and it made me so, so, disappointed that in the end he and Man Wol barely had a proper conversation. You have to realize that he was there for MW all along. For 1300 years he stayed by her side despite knowing that it would weaken his soul and he would cease to exist. That's something I couldn't get over. Even though I really wanted to like GCS and MW together because I know that they were adorable I just couldn't like them as much as I did GCM. Despite all the heartbreaking scenes that we see MW and GCS have when they separate, the only time I have ever cried while watching this drama was when GCM and MW meet during the wedding and when he killed himself with her blade.

Finally, I just have to mention this, but I find it complete BS that they tried to pull with the ""he had met her first all those years ago"" in the last episode. Like, are you kidding me?! According to what we see, he found her, sorta kinda saves her (with water?), because I'm pretty sure she was half dead and water or food isn't gonna cut it here. So that bit was very confusing. The least they could have done was come up with some better storyline for GCS. They tricked us for so many episodes into believing that GCM and GCS were the same person and then makes it so that it's a big twist that they aren't. This means that GCS never had any connections to MW he was just destined to save her, and that's okay. But they definitely didn't have to go and pull the ""they were meant to be"" because 1300 years ago he sorta kinda saves her?

Honestly, it may be just my personal opinion but it would have been so much better if GCS turned out to indeed be a reincarnation of GCM. Destined to save her in order to atone for his previous sins. Then he would have to one day remember his past and realized that he is the reason the woman he loves is this way, and they would have Man Wol go through the process of realizing that she had fallen in love with him again and try to separate the idea that GCS and GCM are different people despite the former being the reincarnation of the latter. That would connect with all the different stories that this drama was trying to tell, like with YW and the princess.

All in all. I find myself to be a hard critic when it comes to drama, and perhaps it was just me that felt this way, but I just couldn't fall in love with this drama as much as I wanted to.

When you look for drama, romance, thriller, emotion, supernatural , it's the perfect drama circling everything above with a little spiceness of horror. It's IU's drama means it will be one of the best drama . Her acting makes this drama more beautiful. The way she carried all the looks , the way she represented the character Jang Man Weol, it seems like no one can better play that role than her. Yeo Jin Goo also played Ku Chan Seong role very good. The other casts are very good. The OSTs are very touching as there are fourteen OSTs, the story will keep it amusing till the end.
Usually I get bored during episode 12-14 as at that period it become boring except the mystery genre, but in this case , I just watch it as fast the drama gets subtitles on the websites.
-- Overall this drama is worth to watch and you will feel that your time has been used in a good way, now stop reading reviews and watch it ! ????

Decent story with ONE OF THE BEST OST's EVER
The main hook of this dramas was its music score/OST there was not one bad song in the title. I have seen a lot of Kdramas and for every one that has one or two memorable songs there are very few where every song not only works, but is worth listening to again and again, even my mom who doesn't watch dramas remarked on how pretty the songs were.
The plot is nothing unique, it really is a typical ghost drama, but the chemistry and acting by the leads makes it memorable.

The finale left an open end for a season 2, I would watch it.

The cinematography was out of this world !
The show was a bit overhyped because IU, the queen herself was the main lead. Coming to the story line, it was refreshing and engaging compared to other fantasy dramas. A great concept even though it wasn't up to the mark.
The show leaves you with a bitter sweet feeling like any other IU drama.
Ost!!!!! The osts were soo good, which was the only reason I didn't dropped watching it. You know the drama is worth watching when punch sang the ost.
Overall the drama was fine ( it could've been more better tho )

I love every single story details of these series has. From the unexpected plot twists, the flashbacks, and also the simple stories of the cast. The character really fits and they delivered really well, the music is already stuck in my mind hahaha. but the one that catches me the most was the beauty of IU! Her character really suits her since Man-weol has that resting bitch face and she delivered it perfectly. The character development of the story she has from Episode 1 till Episode 16 makes me really happy. Overall 10/10 for me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Another drama by the famous Hong Sisters. The sisters are famous for making fantasy drama and you can see their style has grown from their previous drama like Hwayugi and Master Sun. So far I think this is my fav from all their previous work I have seen.

The first episode is just so powerful. The introduction of the characters and the set where IU as Mang Weol shows up with a bang. It has already hooked me up. IU is really great and has become a very powerful actress. Her way of speaking as well as her body language is on the point. I cannot think that there will be another actress that can play the role as well as her.

In the beginning, I feel no chemistry between the lead but slowly by each episode, you can feel the chemistry is building as well as the romance between them starting to grow as well.

There are couples episode that you might feel like filler but each story indirectly carries a subtle message. Like the story about the dead bride is like a premonition about what end we will get from Man Weol and Chang Sung.

The side characters are loveable. The side couple is so sweet and even sweeter than the main couple. I hear the one who plays Ji Hyun Joong is actually a new actor. But he acts really well and kind of able to ignite me, as audience to sympathize deeply with what his characters feel. I feel like wanting to stan him for his next projects.

The backlash about this drama is probably that some episode is made like in a rush. I hear that the production team spend so much money on the first couple episode. I feel some episode is made a little bit in lower quality, another thing is way too many soundtrack song is used. I get that it serves to promote the song. But I feel like the song kind of sometimes destroy the ambiance of the drama. While the songs are good, I think it better to use it moderately and use an instrumental BGM instead. And a lot of product placement as well in the drama that is very obvious.

Overall I enjoy the ride. This drama raises my emotion when I don't expect it and keep going like a storm. The ending is justifiable and for the first time, I feel like 16 eps is not enough for K drama. I feel in my heart that I don't want to part with this drama yet.

Endpoint, this drama might not be a cup of tea for everybody but it has a special place for me. If you like Goblin and Hwayugi, you should give this drama a try. But if these are not your kind of drama, just move on.

Hotel Del Luna started off as something dark, mysterious, fascinating and glamorous. Episode 1 was an amazing watch which got me hooked on this show. The music, fashion and acting were stellar. However as the story progresses, the first few episodes were mainly content with few scenes of romance, while towards the ending, we get many scenes of romance without much content. I find that it doesn't balance out too well for me.

I came from watching Absolute Boyfriend starring Yeo Jin Goo, and he was very well suited for that role. In HDL, his character doesn't have much progression, just mostly acting like a wimp and then being brave and manly (Yeo Jin Goo's acting is in fact really good, and it is somewhat a waste for him to portray Ku Chan Seong). IU's character on the other hand, had much more to portray, and I must say, she is the best person to act out Jang Man Weol. The small details such as eye contact and also the instances of being hilarious while putting on a straight face is something IU does very well.

Halfway through this series, I rated it a 9, and after completing it, dropped it to 8.5. There is much more to be developed, such as the backgrounds of the other hoteliers and how Hotel Del Luna came to be what it is today. All these were briefly explained, which I feel didn't make the cut, as some of them like Ji Hyun Joong and Kim Sunbae have interesting stories behind them which were poorly developed. There was a lack of romance/chemistry between the two main leads, such that my favorite couple has to go to Hyun Joong and Yoo Na.

The story is mostly simple, but at the start, there are many random introductions of ghosts with again, poorly developed storylines. The first 2 episodes were really solid, but somehow thereafter the series became lackluster. It was only with IU's acting, the OST and the cinematography that the drama was somewhat saved. On an overall, Hotel Del Luna is a breath of fresh air from mainstream K-dramas, intriguing and breathtaking at times. However, I give this a low rewatch value as it does not impress. Hotel Del Luna is something special and unique, only that if you are expecting a strong story plot, it might have fell short.

Heartbreaking but so worth it
The story is great, I truly loved it and my emotional being couldn't really handle the end but I'm rewatching it anyways because the heartbreak is worth everything. Everything is just so pretty, the colours scheme/filming, the story, the actors, everything.
The producers really did a great job at making this, the scenery and everything was beautiful and already worth watching this. I really loved IU and the character she played, while I was watching I think I slowly fel in love with Jang Man Wol too. The fact that she left the human world at the end broke me but at the same time I also knew she finally found peace.
I loved the side-characters too, they were thought out well and really brought something to the story. It was also nice that they had backstories of their own, that way we really got to know them.
Overall I loved this and I can only recommend you watch this drama!

This is a very good fantasy mystery sci-fi drama! The viewer gets to enjoy a stunning cinematography, wonderful cast and a mesmerizing soundtrack to counteract two things on which the drama fall deficient- Gu Chan-seong and his relationship with Jang Man-wol, and the dual timelines. Gu Chan-seong is just a catalyst for Jang Man-wol’s character when it could have been so much more given the fact that he was always the person who loved her the most, and still, the writers couldn’t entirely fuse the love story into the complex and strong Jang Man-wol character ultimately resorting to a sweet and soulful romance, a disappointment when you have actors of high caliber as Lee Ji-eun (IU) and Yeo Jin-goo. The drama’s focal point is Jang Man Weol and Lee Ji-eun (IU) delivers an excellent performance bringing this character to life. The rest of the cast become an extension to her character delivering a sweet romance, thrill, drama, and comedic moments to her emotionally laden persona. The second deficiency on this show is the merging of timelines, past and present. The plot could have been better if only the present timeline would have the same important development as the past, but it fell short in comparison. Even though the drama is not perfect, it is entertaining and fun to watch. Enjoy it!

An amazing drama!
The drama being the first one I have ever finished watching speaks for itself. I've started quite a number, but Hotel Del Luna fascinated me so much that I couldn't stop watching and completed it within days. The acting is amazing, the actors - absolutely stunning and talented, the storyline was definitely interesting, keeping you on your toes not knowing what would happen next. Not to even start on praising the music - all the songs played added even more feeling to the scenes, they were all so very beautiful. I certainly recommend watching the drama, it is a favourite to many.

Don't Let the High Ratings Fool You. THIS DRAMA IS DESERVES HIGHER.
Hands down, Hotel Del Luna is one of the best k dramas. I have ever watched. The leads had excellent chemistry and always stood by each other. The plot was well executed. I have only praise for this drama. I love how everything is not explained in too much detail. If everything is set in stone it seems like an info dump to me. So I adored how the writer left some things open ended and give us hints to fit the pieces together ourselves. I'm very intellectual and thought-oriented which made this very engaging for me. The plot was very unique and had well planned and timed flashbacks. I can't say enough about the OSTs. They are the most beautiful things ever. I could listen to the tracks forever. Crime and thrillers were neatly integrated into the already multi-dimensional plot. Don't believe anyone who says that Hotel Del Luna has a sad ending. Like I said, it's for the audience to form their own conclusions. Overall, its the best. The ratings reflect exactly how good this drama actually is. Infact, I could even call this drama underrated for that is how good it is.

I started this drama because I liked the concept of ghost hotel showed in the trailers and of course i just love IU and i like Yeo Jin Goo. To be honest this drama didn't follow the concept I imagined after watching the trailer. But I still liked it a lot. This will definitely go to my favorites' list. I truly recommend this drama to everyone, because it is beautiful and I am sure you will love that. BUT people who don't like subplots might be bored.
I watched many of the Hong Sisters' dramas, and the Director's dramas and well, none of them were out of ordinary, they all had a great start but failed to keep being great later for me. However this one I can say may be considered as an exception and a success. Maybe that is because of IU's character, but overall ot was great :)

Shorter review at the end.

Story:
Tied destinies, tied fates. The red knot that is connecting all of them shows us a story of love friendship and atonement.
This drama is about a Korean legend, that somewhere around there, there is a place a hotel of the moon where the people who passed away can stay for few days, can rest before they go on to the journey to the afterlife.
The story centers around Man Wol (full moon) and the new manager at her hotel. It's a story that goes through time and space and is a really long one. However during this journey you also see a lot of others. Ghost's side stories that happen throughout a drama and take a lot of time. Well, I truly LOVE this kind of side stories. It's like the good old Japanese mystery dramas/animes I loved. Lots of sidestories all of them can be a story of their own but they still all connect the main story. There are people around there who don't enjoy these kind of things, so If you are so, you might not like the drama as much as I did, however I guarantee you will love the beauty of the drama and IU in it. So you might as well give it a try :)
I loved how this drama focused on the afterlife. Usually the ghost stories don't interest me. But I loved that they showed how people can be taken over by their feelings, almost eaten up and have to wait until that clears, so they can go forward to the afterlife world and then be born again. They showed how sometimes Man Wol helped them not to lose themselves, keep the consciousness and wait till their grudge calms down or disappears. They showed how everything in people's life is not simple and yet it is not so complicated after death. The whole concept of the hotel where ghosts can stay and rest before going to the after life was amazing. I also liked how it changed with time and looked suitable to the era it was in. I liked how they showed that those ghosts can be super scary and at the same time they are still those humans wanting or willing something, it can be something terrible though. It also showed that the grudge even if fulfilled can't be so satisfying as it seemed to be. I really loved it. I loved the concept of feeling of guilt too and how it can make people do unimaginable things even after death. I totally liked all the special services the hotel provided. Anyway it's a complex story about fates that are tied together even after death.

Characters:
Oh IU is marvelous as Man Wol! lol I think everyone heard of her amazing wardrobe, hairstyles and makeup. Well She changed her outfit like 7-10 times during an episode and i LOVED it. haha sometimes it was ridiculous but sometimes it was amazing. Beautiful! But Man Wol was not only pretty she was very strong. a perfect woman. She was feminine yet very strong and at the same time fragile. I loved how she felt confident even while not understanding the economic stuff. I find it also cute how she lived so many years but didn't spent them for learning (which i would LOL) but rather she was all about eating and dressing. haha I loved her character a lot. And I think it will not be wrong to say that this drama hold on to this character and is build around her. Gu Chan Song was also nice. He was an average boy who studied well, in prestige places. He wasn't a special character BUT he was very kind and sweet and smart. I loved him. Thanks to that simple yet warm personality Man Wol could have been moved. <3
I just loved all the main side characters! The three employees of the hotel were such a nice and cute team. I love that we saw more of them at the end. Each of the characters had their own complicated past but each of them still became new people working there and i loved their different personalities. I loved Sanchez(<3) and Mi Ra and the Detective. Sanchez i loved the most out of them. He was a funny friend of the male lead and i think he added a lot of comedy to the show as well as grief.
I totally Loved the gods!! <3 All their personalities were so different and they all did different things <3
I would have liked to talk about all the side characters, even minor ones and even cameos, but I will stop here. :)

Cinematography:
As I said this drama is beautiful! I am going to make a list of beautiful dramas. It's amazing! I really love the cinematography here. And I love the wardrobe of the characters. <3

Acting:
Acting was a Top-Notch. Well I always wanted to say about acting in Characters as they go hand to hand but I saved it for here. IU is always great at acting, i love her in all of her dramas. After the Most amazing but dark and sad my mister role, here she was vivid, wonderful and outstanding. She made the outfit changing in the drama something to look forward to. Yeo Jin Goo is always great at acting but I think this is his BEST tole as a grown-up after Circle. I loved circle but all his other dramas were just meh after it. Finally he got a role where he could fully shine :) Other actors were also amazing! P.O did a great job!!! omg i never thought he will play so well lol xDDD I hope he gets more roles now :) And the Cameos were wonderful!!! So many people made cameos <3 And the last cameo was just soooo impressive!!!!!!!!!
I want to separately say about the Ma Go God. That actress is amazing, truly!! I am so happy she played here lol. The most memorable role of her that I saw was in Good Thief Bad Thief. Oh my she was crazy there. I hated her character with all my heart at first and at the end of the drama I couldn't wait to see her lol. Here she was amazing playing so many <3 I became a fan.

OST:
Well Ost was great :) nice songs, nice artists. what was left in my memory was mostly IU's song that was played only once lol. I just love IU's singing and her Flower Bookmark albums. Also her in MUDO festival with Park Myung Soo XD haha


IN SHORT!! :

What i liked:
-IU!! IU !! IU!!
-Yeo Jin Goo
-The three employees
-Outfits
-Beauty
-cameos
-some concepts
-somewhat ending
-ending super last scene!!!!

What I didn't like:
-some parts of the ending (well It was very logical and well done!! (minor Spoiler!!!!!!!!) - she had to leave and I agree with it yes, but overall they could have showed it much better)
- ending outfits and slowness ( LOL well this one is just something to say if I have to really say something i didn't like, because overall i liked it a lot lol, but during the last episode everything felt super slow, and her outfits were not so amazing. I understand it was necessary though so this can't be considered as something bad about the drama. I just have nothing else to say lol)

hmmmm i can't find anything else i didn't like lol. It was great! A bit not what I expected but It was great I loved it! <3


P.S. I don't usually re-watch dramas so the score i give there is random.

Spectacular, Amazing, Fantastic
STORY: I really liked this drama. I know many people don't really like idol/singer actors but this one is really good. The story was interesting. There was one main story, about Jang Man-Wol and her sins and etc and there were minor stories about the ghosts. This kept the drama interesting and made me want to watch more.
ACTING/CAST: The 2 had really good chemistry and the person who played the male lead (forgot his name) did a really good job playing the character and IU also did a good job playing the selfish cold character.
MUSIC: The reason why the music rating is low is because I didn't find the music so catchy or emotional. There was like one emotional song and made me want to search it up and listen to it but it wasn't so catchy.
REWATCH VALUE: The reason why I gave this section such a high rating is because I watched this drama so many times that I lost track. I don't know how to explain it but the drama makes you miss the scenes and stories.

Anyways I hope you find this helpful and I hope you enjoy the drama :)

Whoaaah. I love it! Each episode never let me down :""D

The plot goes continuous just like any K-Drama, but what I love the most is that they also repeat certain story loop like what you see on the daily cartoon for kids. It's like watching Conan, even those side stories makes me feel so curious.

I love how the color-grading is. Pretty much like KPOP MV. I love the OST, especially the one sung by Tae Yeon. I really love the cast. The characters are all well-created and the casts play them well. Because of this drama I can see IU not as a musician, but a true actress. I even watched her old drama--Moon Lovers' Scarlet Heart Ryeo because of this drama. Ku Chan Seong tho, everything that he does just makes sense, as if I've known him for a long time. Oh, I love that Yuna character, very charming, lovely, and pretty =^ ^=

I know I should wait a little longer to let me pulse settle down before reviewing this show, but I just can’t help it. Hotel Del Luna, right now, is the best show I’ve ever watched. I realize that my taste is not the same as others, so I’ll explain why I think this is so fabulous.

Story:
This is a morality play with people portraying virtues or as in this case the faces of God. In episode 1 we are introduced to Jang Man Wol (portrayed perfectly by IU) who is revenge happy and is killing everyone she comes in contact with. With an interesting altercation with the grandmother persona of Ma Go Shin (stunning performance by Seo Yi Sook), she thrusts her angry sword into a tree and becomes the owner of a hotel for ghosts remaining on earth to deal with unresolved issues before moving on to the next step.

Flashforward 1300 years and the Hotel Del Luna is a gorgeous hotel with the anti-hero Jang Man Wol and her interesting employees still helping or not the dead. The hotel requires a human manager to deal with the mortal world and Goo Chan Sung (sigh….Yeo Jin Goo) gets the job (through some interesting back and forth between him and Jang Man Wol). Each episode deals with different guests and their afterlife needs. This show has it all, horror, romance, bromance, suspense, comedy, fantasy, and more. It does tackle the serious subject of holding grudges beautifully

Characters:
There wasn’t one actor that didn’t do a “kick butt” job in this show from IU’s performance as Jang Man Wol to Lee Do Hyun’s insane second male lead story line to the cameo performances from such greats like Candidate #1 and #2 played by Lee Shi Un and Lee Joon Gi (both were amusing). I wrote a couple of articles on the show, so I won’t go into detail nor will I give any spoilers just to say, every character was well written and acted….although I would have loved a little more screen time and lines for the grim reaper because he was just delightful. And the cameo of Kim Soo Hyun at the end…..well worth it just for that scene alone!

Music:
Wow…the music was just exceptionally good, so good I even downloaded a few songs. The Done for Me and Can You See My Heart songs are used in key scenes that just made me cry or shiver in dread. They were my favorite, but the rest were wonderful as well.

Re-watch-ability:
Needless to say, I have already re-watched this all the way through once and picked up a few more key insights that I missed the first time thru. I recommend it because it is just as good, if not better, the second time thru.

Overall:
I JUST LOVED THE MORALITY PLAY! There is something about symbolism and stories of right and wrong that I just adore…I can’t get enough of. HDL really hits it out of the park with the what is good and what is bad question. Hotel Del Luna blends the morality play and the other genre’s beautifully…if you didn’t like it as much as I did…sorry. All I can say is this show speaks to my sensibilities. The writers obviously had me in mind when creating such an awesome show. (Ok not really but it felt like it!)

This drama was really hyped about. I follow a number of kdrama pages on instagram and everyone seemed to talk of this drama. So when I found this drama on netflix, I gave it a go.
This drama didn't really deserve the hype that it got. I think the hype was only because of IU in the drama. IU was top notch. I loved the acting, loved the character that she was given and even loved the back story that her character was given. But just her was insufficient to maintain my interest in the show. I often found myself skipping bits of it. Only towards the end though; the beginning of the drama had me hitched.
My favourite part of the story was when they showed how Man wol and Chan sung had met 1300 years ago. I loved that bit. It was cute and adorable. Even Choi Seo Hee's back story was touching.
The drama was really good but it wasn't great.

Watching this drama was incredible, It was filled with sadness, happiness, full emotional rollercoaster and life lessons. Of course, we can't watch dramas without any moral lessons or influences. This drama gave me a lesson that life takes time. We may not get what we want or accomplish our goals in life, but if we have the time to be dedicated and actually have hope, then someday or in our next life we can achieve it. This drama was very emotional from each episode I have watched, and since Man Wol has been living for more than a thousand years, she probably experiences everything that a human being can experience. She showed us that no matter what obstacles we can across in life, we shouldn't give up and just keep going. She was chained because of her revenge and action, but she manages to stay strong and her not giving up, the deities decided to give her someone who can be with her. Someone who can help her, comfort her and loved her. Chan Sung changed her. The relationship between Man Wol and Chung Myung hit me so hard. Their past was so amazingLY.... that I wanna say what happened. T.T
Hotel Del Luna was basically all the genre that you can think of, it was crazy, scary, funny, thrilling, romantic, and LUXURIOUS. IU was so pretty on all of her clothing. I've never seen her wear the same clothing in this drama... The cinematography was impressive, the building of 'HOTEL DEL LUNA' and the action figures were crazy. I loved their chemistry especially those funny scenes and JEALOUSY moments. The twist that happened in this drama hooked me up... and made me cry non-stop... I don't know what else to say since all I've been doing was cry till I finished this drama. The ending was exceptional, it gave me my own ending nonetheless, the experience, lesson and memories that this drama gave me were magnificent. The quote, ""Feeling sad and disappointed...is only natural when witnessing disappearances."" This quote hit me because it's true. Don't we sometimes feel emotional when something we love disappears, but when they are there... we don't care or we're like meh..? That's why we should cherish what we have and be grateful for what we are getting. Let's appreciate our loved ones because we don;'t know when the time will be up or when our people will 'disappear'. We can't predict tomorrow and the future. All we can do is be thankful and be happy.
Thank you, HOTEL DEL LUNA cast.
Thank you <3 <3 <3

Top notch cast and acting all around. Killer OSTs - there is a valid reason why HDL OSTs completed took over the charts in Korea. IU and Yeo Jin Goo not only nailed their characters - their chemistry and acting were perfect - fantastic partnership between two of Kdramas most talented young actors as acknowledged by the K-industry and media. If you're looking for mushy sickeningly romantic scenes then this drama isn't for you. Yet there was plenty of moving and heart-melting moments between the two leads. Huge shout out to the supporting cast for moving the story forward and keeping the momentum going. My family, group of friends and I were emotionally invested through and through - the main plot, side stories (in hindsight, all were foreshadowing), the chemistry between the cast, humour, cinematography and music but most prominent - the level of acting, kept us glued to the tv screen every weekend. Hoping for another drama with Yeo Jin Goo and IU - our favourite actors after watching the masterpiece that is Hotel Del Luna. Highly recommended!!!

Hotel del Luna is a drama that revolves around a woman who is the owner of a hotel for the dead and the previous encounters that led her to were she was in present time and how she finds love in the arms of a general manager who she forced to work for her. I personally loved this drama it had everything from good directing to great screen writing to the best of editing and the sound track is amazing. I love IU and Yeo Jin goo they gave a heart warming performance that leaves a well imprinted impression. The story line is well crafted and without doubt unique in all edges. Watch this drama you’ll love it!

Story

The plot of this drama is definitely something new; each episode leaves you with a lot to think about. That isn't to say however that the plot is free of cliches and stereotypes. The story was also predictable. I already guessed (correctly) how it will end when i got to episode 6. It's a refreshing take of a fantasy drama, but it's not really something to rave on about.



Acting/Cast

Good! The leads were awesome, especially IU. The supporting cast was great as well. A lot of people are criticizing the chemistry between IU and jin goo... I do not think they were bad, their chemistry just wasn't suited for something romantic in my opinion. Overall, it's not a deal breaker and it shouldn't be



Music

My only barometer for a good drama ost is if it (a) matches the mood of the scenes in the story and (b) if it makes me listen to it outside the drama. Generally, the music was bad. They were all mellow if not sad. It was mehhhh


Rewatch value

It's actually a relatively simple plot so rewatching this for me is fine. Not something I look forward to, but something I can stand



Overall

A good fantasy drama to give a try. It's not quite at the level of god-tier fantasy dramas like goblin or while you were sleeping, but it definitely has its own charm. By charm, i mean the visuals and the effects

The opening scene of the story shows a beautiful landscape and a woman warrior beside a cart that has a casket on it. It seemed that she has killed a lot of people and she's looking for a place she heard that souls can reside before going to the afterlife. For some reason, she's even willing to kill herself to repent for her sins. She then ends up as the proprietor of a hotel for souls. Fast forward into the present time, the main male lead character (Yeo Jin Goo) has grown up and needs to fulfill a bargain that his father made with her. The deal that was made is similar to the story of the beauty and the beast where the father plucked a blooming flower for his daughter. Only this time, it's a dad offering his son's life in servitude to a thousands-year-old woman.

Honestly, this story got me interested right away. It's a pretty good ghost story so far. Main female lead (IU) looks convincing as a warrior at the beginning and looks gorgeous in her flowing outfits when she became the boss of Hotel de Luna. I'm looking forward to her beautiful wardrobe changes and see if there will be sparks between the main leads. Male lead Jin Goo looks dashing in a suit and playing his character well. There's also some comedic relief I'd like to see more.

Will update review later on.

In the beginning I did not want to watch this drama. I m not really a fan of ghosts or fantasy ish dramas but since I was bored, I watched the first episode and kinda liked it. The first reason was the male lead, whom I ve been waiting for to grow up ever since I miss you. Anyway, I ended up waiting for the episodes weekly so I can say it s a drama I actually like. Even so, it s not the best drama ever. why?

1. The story. Even though I was excited to hear more about Man Wol s past, I can say it was not constructed really well. I think it needed more details and I find it that I still have some unanswered questions. Also, the daily ghost situation: at first it was ok, they were interesting but It got boring. Watching the same thing over and over again (new ghost, idk Chan Sung is in danger, Man wol saves him etc etc). The love story was slightly covered ( I find that their love didn t really have a point where it started--- which I should like, because technically the love grew bigger and bigger---but I saw no starting point)
What I mean is that I think the drama had no focus: it wasn t really the love story, but it wasn t the ghosts either. Lets say it was her past. Was it really? The past doesn t cover much.

2. The acting was ok. As expected form IU (obviously). The others acted well but there werent that many scenes where they could have shown really cool acting skills either. That s why I gave it a 9. The cast was really well chosen tho.

3. The music was on point. It made sad scenes even more heart breaking.

4. Hmm. Rewatch.. I would rewatch this but only in a few years maybe, after I forget what it is about. To be honest, I m pretty sure I won t. When I rewatch dramas I pick a random episode, because I know that every episode has something good going on. But here, I don t really know, there s a boring vibe it gives me.

*IMPORTANT* even though from this review it sounds like I kinda hated it, it s not true. I enjoyed every episode and when I had to be excited or shocked I was. The review compares it to my expectations of a really really good drama (also I ve just finished another one and it really blew my mind. So i might be comparing to it as well).
For a first watch, it is a cute drama that IS WORTH WATCHING.

I heard a lot of hype from this show so my curiosity eventually led me to watching this. I definitely think this deserves the hype it gets.

PLOT the beginning each scene was engaging and the plot that unfolds leaves you wondering what happens next. The storyline is very much like goblin so can't really say its original but it was still interesting nonetheless. A lot of plotlines from the other characters and the ghosts from the hotel were thrown at me but I was more interested in finding out about Man Weol's past. I must admit that I did think the overall storyline of the drama was kinda confusing and even after finishing this not everything makes sense. I do think that the show spent too much time focusing on the storylines of the ghost who would come into the hotel. Like sometimes they were interesting but I wanted to see more of Man Weol and Gu Chan Sung, damnit!

The CINEMATOGRAPHY is beyond beautiful. There wasn't a single seeing that wasn't any short of wonderful. Even the boring scenes we're nice to look at because of the amazing production that went into the sets.

The COSTUME DESIGN was exquisite. The main cast always looked good but IU's wardrobe was on another level. Her clothes matched her character so well. She definitely look the part. Gu Chan Sung wore suits most of the time but hey you can never go wrong with a suit ;)

The ACTING was excellent and the scenes between the Man-wol and Chan-sang were so enchanting to watch. Each interaction between them was truly captivating. I couldn't get enough of them both on the screen together. I definitely think they had some chemistry.

The OSTs are literally so amazing I have no words. every song was right for the scene it was put in. The music truly transported you into the story as you were watching. Taeyeon's ""all about you"" and Paul Kim's ""so long"" are my favorites. Punch's ""another day"" was very good also. This is the first drama where I actually like all the osts.

OVERALL I give this drama a 8.5/10. I started watching dramas last year but out of the ones I've seen so far this one is one of my favorites.

I was looking for a k-drama to watch when a friend of mine suggested me this. When I found out that IU was the main female protagonist, I was really enthusiastic and I had a lot of expectations. Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo was a hit and it made such an impact and headline not just to the avid k-drama community but also to the people who were just interested in k-dramas in general. It was the talk of the town, so naturally, I had very high expectations for this one. And let me tell you that this drama has met those expectations and I was satisfied until the end.

This drama has the perfect twists and turns at the perfect time. The flow of the story from one event to another is smooth and somehow seamless. It does not drag or suffer the plot in any way. Although I wish that they could have given more emphasis on the character of Lee Do Hyun (aka Go Chung Myung, the captain of the guards). But, aside from that, the story was well written and well-directed. IU, as well as her co-actors, really did a good job of delivering what the drama needed. They did it justice. Each character is important for the story and I'm glad that they gave emphasis on the backstory of each character whether it be main or supporting. The ending though it was confusing at first, really is the proper way to end the series. (I've cried like gallons of tears for this drama, especially the last episode so brace yourself)

As for the music aspect, this drama has the most beautiful soundtracks that I've heard. So far, this is only the k-drama that I've liked all of the soundtracks. (I'm not even joking). In fact, I've downloaded all of the soundtracks and I listen to it from time to time on my phone. The heartwrenching songs combined with the actors' drama really makes you so damn emotional.

So, would I rewatch this? Definitely. Maybe in the near future, I would rewatch this series. This series really made an impact on me as the viewer and I would definitely be at the top of my list for a long time.

Hard to get over with...
Oh My God.. I felt sad after it ended.. I wanted to know what the fellow viewers are feeling. I ended up reading a lot of stuff regarding Hotel del Luna, reviews and went on downloading many pictures related to it, especially of GO CHUNG MYUNG character. He (Lee Do Hyun) resembled a lot like Kim Sang Bum (Kim Bum of Boys Over Flowers fame). .. ... . Even after two days of watching, I still feel pangs of pain. The ending was all fine and acceptable yet, hard to get over.. As the drama says - We should learn to let go than holding onto it, I should learn to let go of the sad feeling and so, I'm rewatching Hotel del Luna. So that, I can feel less sadder than before. :D

A friend of mine liked this drama, although she did indicate, it was kind of silly. I have tried watching it for my friend. What can I say?

The plot is awful. I think the hardest part for me was to buy into that fantasy where there were ghosts, that's why the whole drama was ruined. I understand that ALL dramas are just someone's pure fantasy but I believe that ghosts stories are just for naive girls. You basically have to turn off ALL of your common sense, not just some parts of it.

For those who are reading my review, I am so sorry to break it to you: ghosts do not exist. And if they do exist, they don't look Korean. And if they do look Korean, they are not covered with stage makeup. And if they are covered with stage makeup, then you are probably watching Hotel Del Luna.

I believe in many things - in Einstein's theory of relativity, in string theory, in quantum mechanics, in electromagnetic nature of waves, but I cannot accept seeing ghosts in stage makeup speaking Korean - it's just too simple. So the fantasy element was a huge turn-off.

Now for the actors. I absolutely love Yeo Jin-Goo and was going to watch it just for him but IU ruined yet another drama for me. For all IU's fans out there: she is a beautiful girl, a really nice human being, an amazing performer in MVs, she looks good in dresses, she knows her lines, she works very hard. But one thing she is not. She is not a real actress. I am saying it with great sadness because I would LOVE to watch her act at least once. She fails when it comes to living the character.

The whole drama reminded me of a music show on Broadway like Cats or The Phantom of the Opera. It's beautiful, it's well-directed, yet it's just entertainment in its pure form, extremely superficial, nothing to do with reality. Maybe it's just not my drama.

Unpredictable plot with script that makes you constantly think & analyse (SPOILER: Ending Explained)
I really love this drama as a whole. I love how groundbreaking and interesting it is that each episode seemed like its only 15 to 30 minutes long. I love how unpredictable it is like literally, you cant guess whats coming and I love how it is structured to make you speculate and ask questions. The editing was made to show the future first and later flashback scenes will follow aka Christopher Nolan’s ‘Momento’ kind of storytelling. You know that a story is great when it can evoke you all kind of emotions and this drama is exactly that. It made you care for the characters, only to play you around and makes you wanting for more. And I salute the writer for her ability to engage the viewers like she did in this drama.

Aside from that, I really love the writer’s little clues here and there. She did a looooot of foreshadowing in this drama. It sure raise a lot of questions but you know whats coming with that. I mean, we after all can predict Jeong Hun’s death the moment Jin Woo asked Jeong Hun to join him at Granada (as in the train flashback scene, Jin Woo is alone and not with Jeong Hun). We also know right away that Marco is the one who hunt Se Joo the moment he made his appearance in the drama (as a blue checkered guy is the one who shot Se Joo). We also know as early as in Episode 2 that Jin Woo’s leg will be injured but his limp is cured the moment he’s playing the game. The dynamic of Jin Woo and Hee Joo’s relationship is also foreshadow since in the earlier episode on how she’s sitting in front of Jin Woo in the rain is making him feel protected and safe. Hee Joo didnt kill the enemies like Jeong Hun would (since after all she cant see Hyeong Seok's NPC), but her presence and existence is like a buffer between Jin Woo and the game and that particular scene perfectly show what would her role be in Jin Woo’s life in the future.

Jin Woo has become one of my very fave Kdramas’ lead characters ever. And I have to give credit to Hyun Bin for that. He played Jin Woo in such a depth that you literally feel his pain just by looking in his eyes. I have watched Hyun Bin for the past 15 years and I have to say that this is simply his best role to date (although Hyun Bin's Robin from 'Hyde, Jekyll, Me' is my soulmate :P). Its been a really long time that I’m this emotionally invested in a character and Hyun Bin portrayal of Jin Woo made me feel Jin Woo’s soul. Aside from his outburst in Episode 1, Jin Woo is actually a really nice, humble and level-headed guy. Its evidenced with the way he talk to other people despite their status – he actually use a polite language (instead of Banmal) to everyone even to his low-level workers. And not to mention that despite his trouble with the game, he still treat people with utmost respect and care despite he himself is facing a real life and death situations.

Now regarding the romance part of the drama, I thought it was done very tastefully and slowly -- in a mature kind of way. You could see clearly why Hee Joo falls for Jin Woo. The mixture of Jin Woo kindness (still giving her the full amount of the contract), to him touching her soft spot (playing guitar), to him still taking care of his ex-wife (despite he didnt need to), to him facing real & death situation when he falls at her hostel, to her taking care of him and Jin Woo asking her to stay... And later when she realised the length Jin Woo went through to find Se Joo. All this small details contribute to why she loves him. And as for Jin Woo, its obvious that he falls for Hee Joo's kindness and strength. He was impressed with her ability to feed her family and was also taken back by her kindness (the length she is willing to go to help him either in interpreting to taking care of him when he's sick), to her quirkiness on how she explodes when she's mad. Plus, the most important of all is how her presence made him feels safe -- even when Hyeong Seok NPC is in front of him (during the rain scene). Hee Joo is like a buffer between the game and Jin Woo. He just unintentionally ask her to stay by his side since he is just too scared to be alone. He didnt understand it either but later, he realised that he likes her for her sincerity -- the one he never get from Su Jin or Yu Ra. And he actually smile and laugh when she is around him which he never did the whole 1 year after their last meeting at Granada when the game make him question his sanity. That is why he had the urge to see her before he completed the final mission since she is someone important in his life. IMO, the romance part was dealt with many minor details and mature way thats why I ended up really liking how their relationship grows despite the horrible situation they're in -- its not too much nor too little. When you are deal with real life and death situation, your feelings intensifies which explain their relationship perfectly.

All in all, I give the drama 9.5/10. It is not perfect but it was interesting as hell and full of unpredictable plots. I would love it more if the writer actually explain how the characters die because loss of blood when they were killed in the game but I guess she just lump sum it up as part of the 'fantasy and mysterious’ part of the game when Emma made the reality and game world collide when Marco stabbed Se Joo with real knife. But aside from these minor details, this drama has become one of the most nerve-wrecking Kdramas in my book. Its rare for me to have palpitation when I watch Kdramas but this drama is one of a rare case and it will always be special in my heart because of that. :D

~ SPOILER ~

Explanation on the Ending:

ITS OBVIOUSLY A HAPPY ENDING. WHY?

I know that many people are really dissatisfied with this drama’s ending. I personally thought the writer trying to be creative with her ending but kind of backfired as many people got confuse with the game concepts and thought that the bug cycle was repeating themselves over and over again now that Jin Woo is still stuck in the game.

On the surface, the drama ended with a bittersweet note with a glimmer of hope at the end. However, after a second viewing, I have to admit that it is after all a clear cut happy ending. I realised many small details that the writer gave to us – that it was clear that despite the ending is ambiguous, the writer aimed for a happy end to both of our main leads. First of all, lets clear the confusion regarding the concept of the game world.

1. At first, I thought that Emma, while one of her features is to delete bugs, is a bug itself as she’s the reason why the game world and the reality world collide when Marco stabbed Se Joo with real knife. I mean, if she’s not there, the whole mess of the game become real wouldn’t happen as Se Joo will just bleed after the stab and probably recover after he go to the hospital. Jin Woo wouldn’t be in that mess and the only one suffers is only Se Joo with the stab wounds on his stomach.

2. Marco is Se Joo’s bug thus he do not need to be deleted for Jin Woo to reset the game. Plus, Jin Woo can't see Marco anyway unless he made an alliance with Se Joo. Bear in mind that Se Joo is the one who create this game and he set the rules. Among the rules are those who gave Fatima the Key to Heaven will win the game and become the new Master. And he also put one of Emma’ s features is to delete bugs and once bugs are deleted, the game will reset. And that is exactly what Jin Woo did; level up, get the key, kill the bugs and hand over the key to Emma and Emma reset the game. Now, why Jin Woo is a bug and need to be deleted? It is because he played the game while the game is in error state. Had other testers of the game made a duel and killed their opponents like Jin Woo, they will be in the same position as Jin Woo as well.

3. Jin Woo made sure he killed all of the bugs and also sacrificing himself in the process to end the game’s sinister elements. Since he already do this and reset the game to zero, there are no more evil cycle of one has to sacrifice themselves to save the others. Once Emma reset everything, it is a new game without bugs/errors/glitches. J One lost all the data and build the game back from scratch that is why it took them another 1 year to release the new game as they have to rebuild everything. The good thing about the whole thing is that is game is finally safe to be played unlike Se Joo’s original game which mix game world and the real world. The writer made it clear that the evil part of the game was buried once and for all when Jin Woo sacrificing himself at the end.

4. It was obvious that Yang Ju finally delete Emma from the new game when we hear that he regretted of keeping Emma where Emma in the end reset the whole game and delete all their hard work for the past 1 year. So no Emma, no more error in the game. There is no more Emma so the features of her to delete bugs and reset back the game is no longer there as well.

5. Regarding whether Hee Joo can see Jin Woo or not, she can see him as she is wearing lenses. All game users can see Jin Woo if he made an appearance that is why the guy at the restaurant insisted that Jin Woo is not NPC but an advanced user. But why there's no name for Jin Woo in the new game? It is because Emma has deleted everything including Jin Woo's game name 'Zinu' that is why he is without name. ‘Instance Dungeon’ is to make one become invisible from the enemies and hide themselves. Se Joo did hide himself for 1 year as Marco is there to hunt him so he keep using the instance dungeon feature to remain safe. Jin Woo in the other hand just use the feature to save himself from getting deleted by Emma. So if he didn't use the instant dungeon feature, other game users can see him. The problem is getting him out of the game and I believe that is Se Joo's task to do that.

And now the for ending, the writer purposely tell us about the 'Instance Dungeon’ and how a user can use it to hide themselves. And later at the end, it is shown that Jin Woo after all did use that feature to save himself. But why is he helping in killing low-level NPCs for other game users just days after the game was released? It is not actually a 'Master’ task to do that and he knew the game is now free from bugs and no one is getting killed for real. But he did it anyway. Why? He did that as a call of help to alert everyone that he is after all still alive but somehow still stuck in the game. He clearly let them know that he is still alive by helping the other game users. Now that Hee Joo knew that he is alive and hidden, it is only a matter of time for him to be saved just like how he saved Se Joo the year earlier. So, technically, it is only a matter of time before he can get his happy ending.

I am pretty much disappointed with the ending but upon second viewing, it wasn’t really that bad like I initially felt. The writer for surely aimed for a happy end, it just that, its not in-your-face type of ending like other dramas.

I started watching it by accident and absolutely loved it. The concept is intriguing. Gamers will find it riveting but non gamers will be awe struck. The visuals were beautiful and animations extremely realistic and convincing. Everybody would go bananas if a game like that would hit the market. For sure! Very interesting to see the interactions of a different culture that I have not been exposed to. I found it absolutely exquisite and intriguing. I had quite a crush on Yoo Jin-woo for a couple of weeks!
The constant replaying of the previous scenes were at times necessary but mostly unnecessary in my view. I skipped them quite often which is something I dont like doing as the series is so beautiful ,that I am scared I will miss a scene and I would like to watch each series without intervention to appreciate it optimally.
I enjoyed Ko Yoo-ra's antics especially in the end when it was said that she only marries rich guys. It was SO funny!
The main characters are very attractive and they play their roles very convincing. The end was a bit disappointing but I understand that a second series is probably planned. I will definitely be watching season two. Cant wait!

As a fan of Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin's work on Secret Garden, I came into Memories of the Alhambra with a lot of optimism, enthusiasm, and excitement for the show. The show's premise was very new and exciting, as the show started, with the story line of a man trying to find the genius inventor of an artificial reality world. The concept was interesting for two reasons. One, this vision of the world being changed through the emerging technological advances of AR is more realistic than fictional, especially when one considers the huge explosion of Pokemon GO! and it's use of AR technology in making fictional creatures real. Two, this concept of having a show revolve around AR isn't commonly used in the tropes of Korean Drama. From my knowledge, only W (which was created by the same screenwriter) had anything close to this concept. The concept of AR created the basis of interest for this show.

However, as the series went on, the story line started to experience a drag in story and, at times, character. One key instance of the story dragging was the show's annoying use of flashbacks. At one point of the series, an entire episode was a flashback with the focus on Hyun Bin's character and the reappearance of Chanyeol's character. Park Shin Hye's character (and, in retrospect, a majority of the female characters) were ultimately useless by the time the show ended. Their characters were so stereotypical and narrow-minded that it made the show unbearable to watch at time.

The one thing that destroyed this series was the lack of story and explanation. For example, Se-Joo's (played by Chanyeol) return to reality leaves a lot of questions that are never answered in the finale. Se-Joo, during his escape from the Ghost of Marco, somehow encases his physical self into a different dimension. An 18 year old kid, who invented an advanced AR Game, somehow broke the laws of physics and was able to hide himself into a different reality. Ultimately, the nail in the coffin for Memories is the finale. Hyun Bin's character disappears and, after hearing of his appearance during simulated fights, Park Shin Hye's character ultimately finds him, or rather, his silhouette, a silhouette that is in the shadows and flickers like a glitch. This open ending in the fate of Jin Woo was insulting. To close off a show, in this type of manner, made the viewer's 16 hours of dedication to the show a waste.

While these are one of the many reasons to why the show was a story-line disaster, the show had some bright notes. One, as stated previously, was Hyun Bin's superb acting. Being able to act as though you're sanity is on the brink of collapse and being able to draw empathy from the audience is a trait that is only available through hard work. Hyun Bin's superb acting, alongside Park Shin-Hye's likeable acting, made this show bearable to watch.

While Hyun Bin and Park Shin-Hye brought interest to the show due to their star power, their brilliant acting is not enough to save Memories of the Alhambra from being a slight disappointment. The lack of storytelling and explanation ultimately destroy what was once a promising show into a show that ends with the slap of disappointment.

I'll put this out there - this drama had SO much potential.

I started off on this one a little skeptical, because fantasy elements in Korean dramas always tend to be a little corny. I held that skepticism until about midway into the first episode, when the plot started to reveal itself, and things actually started to get really interesting.

While the genre of VR gaming has already been vastly explored, this was probably the first high production AR drama to hit the scene. Augmented Reality (AR), for those who are unfamiliar, is a technology which shows computer generated images projected into the real world. Think Pokemon GO. As you can imagine, this sets up some rather amusing scenarios where a person swings around randomly and everyone else gives you weird looks as they can't see what you're seeing. This drama starts off as just that - a rather light hearted take on VR, which not only tries to be funny, but looks silly in the process. As a result, I could not take the first episode seriously and almost dropped it as soon as I began, but things take a turn for the serious rather quickly.

And this is where the problems started arising. The drama, while it made some very interesting plot twists and smart little ideas, seemed like it had no direction. The plot twists, and smart ideas almost felt like the end goal of the writer, only put in there to entertain for the shock factor, just for the sake of it. There was no balance of light-heartedness and seriousness. This then gave rise to a bevy of problems including some major plot holes, pacing issues, and lack of character development - not to mention some ridiculous technologically impossible feats.

All in all, the plot started out a little silly, got really interesting, and ended up really silly because they couldn't fix their mess.

Don't want to talk too much about the other topics really - the actors are top grade, and the musical variety, while small, did the job. The production quality/value was superb - the fact that this was partly shot in Granada speaks volumes.

It's just a shame the plot completely lost itself. If it weren't for the rest of the factors, this would definitely have gotten a much lower score in my books.

I would say that if you like the genre to definitely give it a try as it still invokes interesting thoughts, but all in all it was a little disappointing.

This show is so trippy I totally got hooked by the very first episode. And even though it starts out becoming entertaining because of the mystery aspect, there's a lot of depth to the story which I loved. It's the story of trying to overcome your trauma and for once the characters act like people who have suffered trauma. Both physical and emotional. Hyun Bin plays Yoo Jin Woo a tech hotshot with two broken marriages, who is rude and overbearing. Through chance he gets involved in the life of a hostel owner in Granada played by Park Shin Hye who happens to be the older sister of a genius game designer played by Chanyeol. To give out anything about the plot would be a spoiler tbh so I'll just talk about the other details and things that I liked. First off great acting by all the cast. The cast was picked well even the supporting cast you fell in love with. The shots are beautiful and the script is good for the most part. The concept is unique and the execution is not bad. The only thing that felt somewhat anticlimactic was the ending. But Hyun Bin is so handsome and just gorgeous! I could have watched a hundred more episodes. Especially that one episode where he's completely desperate and goes to his office to start the server and encounters the real side of his boss who once kicked his own son out for monetary gain. That scene the way it was shot, just heartbreaking to watch. And then all the sadness regarding the constant struggle between the friends only because of that one awful person. And especially jinwoos secretary, he was my favorite character! Even when he started playing and their banter, and Hyun Bin says ""do you like me"" lol and he responded with ""I have a gf"" I was laughing and crying! So it's the kind of show you really get emotionally invested it. That end if it was second season bait I'm fine with that but on it's own I think a proper conclusion would have suited this one more. But hey that's just personal preference and it didn't change my actual viewing pleasure of the show at all. I wish Chanyeol had a proper role considering he's a good actor! Regardless, I was not disappointed with the show at all and in fact would have happily watched more episodes. Another thing I want to mention is I love the subtleness of the love story. It didn't feel forced because the characters started to feel love when they actually developed a rapport and as a viewer you don't feel cheated because it feels natural. Also, the love story is not too fluffy which I think is perfect for someone like me to enjoy. The mystery part is more prominent. And it's a good mystery, really well done. Overall, a unique dark drama but darkness wise it wasn't as dark as The Smile Has Left Your Eyes or Children or Voice or Save Me. It was mild comparatively.

This reminds me of W or of Korean Odyssey where they all had so much POTENTIAL and it was just so interesting. And then IT JUST WASN'T.

I'll list a few good things to start: Hyun Bin (superb actor), beautiful sets (Spain is beautiful!) and the intrigue of the AR gaming world and the potential dangers of it, the thrill and suspense of how Jin Woo tries to work out what's going on...

Now the not so good:
I like Park Shin Hye as an actress... so I blame weak writing. Her character, Hee Ju just CRIED so damn much, so weak, and such a NOTHING character. And then the romance was contrived and fake and did not work at all in this story line. I literally came from nowhere and the kisses were like 'why? why right NOW?? There are people coming to kill you omg!"" So many plot holes, where things just didn't make sense.

I wasn't moved to tears when I should have been because I didn't KNOW the characters, there was literally zero character development and I didn't feel like I could relate to anyone. And I think any story/piece of fiction needs to strike a chord or tug at the heart strings, or make the reader recognise or relate to the situations or the characters... but this misses it entirely! I felt like I didn't know any character, or understand their motivations or how they felt or ANYTHING.

I don't mind a sad ending, but this just wasn't worth it for this ending.

If you are looking for something special, then this is the drama for you!
I'm that type of Drama trash that gets fed up easily with repetitive stories, romances, love triangels and the same poor woman/man meets rich man/woman. That's why I'm always out there searching for something new, something special, something I've never seen before and this was that kind of drama for me! I'm a gamer as well and the concept of an AR game like that made me drool.

I'm not a fan of the synopsis which is presented here though... If you are looking for romance, then this might not be the drama for you as it focuses more on action and fantasy/sci-fi. But I tell you... All the scenes regarding these genres were outstanding! I couldn't take my eyes of the TV. The effects were fantastic, the fights were epic and the locations and scenery was beautiful. If you are intrigued, give this drama a shot!

Story:
The story had me on the edge of my seat every episode while I binge watched it. That's all I needed to enjoy this drama to the maximum. The ending could've been a bit different but in my opinion it's not that bad. You could read in between lines as it is an open ending.

Acting/cast:
Hyun Bin was one of my first drama crushes to be honest... I might be a bit biased but I enjoyed his performance so much! He had a lot of difficult scenes in this one and he made me cry with him. Park shin-Hye did a good job as well :) Not her fault that she had to cry so much folks. She made it belivable and I cried with her.

Music:
I love 'Memories of alhambra' as my mother used to play it on guitar as well when I was little. Brought back memories haha. The way they combined it with the unpleasant event in the story got me goosebumps everytime it played. There was another prominent OST which I remember hearing a lot. it was soothing and fitting the atmosphere. Excuse me while I search for 'Memories of Alhambra' on YT.

Rewatch value:
OMG YES! There are way too many epic scenes, fights, effects, beautiful scenery and other things for me to not watch this at least 5 more times.

Overall:
I came for something extraordinary and that is exactly what I got :) The story had some 'holes' for some people but they also forgot that an AR game like that is not possible (yet) and therefore it made this whole drama fantasy/sci-fi genre. I didn't need a scientific explanation for everything as long as I enjoyed the whole thing. The ending left me thinking and I could easily imagine how things actually turned out. The ending is open and people saying it's bad is actually them wanting to see more from this drama, like scenes which should've happened afterwards. They happened in my head and in my heart though.

I just wanted to write what I was thinking... Whoever's going to watch the drama, enjoy.. ^^
Cast, acting and game effects are really so good. You must see all of these perfection..
And here is my opinion 'all' about the drama.. I was watching the drama so fondly until the last few weeks. In fact there was an original story... But when the truth started to come out, I started to have disappointments. There are unanswered questions in my mind.. I couldn't like the facts that I met while I was waiting to see what was going to happen. It has to be the second season, or it should be given a special section.. -_-
..yes, I gave the drama 10 points, and that's just because the story is orginal and acting is really good... and I just wanted to write what I was thinking... that's it..^^
Whoever's going to watch the drama, enjoy..... ^^

Where to start? We were really so excited to see this. We have been gaming for more than ten years, I, for one, love Spain (I have a gihugic painting in the living room of Sevilla that I spent a year painting) and as I had literally just finished watching Crash Landing on You, I was even more stoked to see what the talented actor Hyun Bin could do. There also have been reviews that were interested in a gamer’s take on it. I went in relaxed, hyped by the positive reviews, and with an open mind.
I really did.
OMG.
First off, I’m going to nerd out, zero shame. I don’t think a gamer was involved in the writing of this at all, other than the occasional verbiage they toss out. If there was, I’m pretty sure he or she is a troll, or had such a bad experience PVPing right when they began that they ragequit. There are so many things that are just not happening in the gaming world. Simple things. Like for instance, when you just start a game, the first NPC you fight isn’t going to take 50+ times to kill. I don’t care how much of a noob you are. Even the most complex game gives you breathing room to adjust to the controls and idiosyncrasies before it really starts challenging you. Yes it takes more to level endgame than it does in the beginning- BUT you don’t get XP by killing low level NPCs unless you’re low level too. It just doesn’t work that way in ANY game I know. The scene where he drives by in a car and guns down the NPCs the newbies are fighting with in the starting zone? Yeah, I don’t know if even trolls bother to do that. It’s just beyond obnoxious. Now I could see if he was legit concerned about the noobs and trying to keep them safe, but it didn’t present that way and certainly wasn’t in his personality to do so.
That brings me to the show’s personality archetypes. There are only two people in this entire show- the secretary, and the little sister that we nicknamed “Total -harm” (i think her shirt actually said totally charming but it was partially covered in a way that made it adorably apt)- that aren’t either utterly unlikeable or completely frustrating.
I don’t even think the leads in this could truly engage with their characters because, while I could tell they were trying, so much of it felt stilted and one dimensional.
The ML is pretty much a Trump-type stuffed into a supermodel’s body, which to me is just the devil incarnate- if the devil weren’t even remotely intriguing and was just off putting instead. I told myself, however, that no matter how much I might want to punch the ML at first, Kdramas have a tendency to give the guy layers (Secretary Kim etc) and let you see past the surface to the decent person underneath. But…. halfway through, and I was still wanting to punch him. Two episodes from the end, and I am stymied with the feeling that if he hadn’t been stuck in circumstances entirely beyond his control and didn’t need her to soothe his wounded ego, he would still be same a$$**** that yelled at her so viciously in the beginning. And that scene… where he just unloads on her, gets the phone call where he finds out she’s intrinsic to his business goals, and then turns around with that smile on his face? I got totally creeped out. ( I’m going to need a Hyun Bin palate cleanser after this. I don’t want to hate him) The FL, adorable as she is, spent most of the time crying and being helpless. (UGH, put your big girl panties on and kick some gaming ass, why don’t you?? It’s your BROTHER) I’m sorry but if a game- or anything else- ate my sister, whatever-it-was would be in for an entire world of hurt.
And really, this was a Netflix original? Did there need to be SO MUCH product placement?
We desperately stuck with it however. The guy that I watched this with was determined to stick with it too, because he felt he deserved an explanation for the bizarre twists the show kept throwing out. We just needed to know how it ended. We knew by then, even if it somehow managed to validate everything into something shiny and glowy and new, it still wouldn’t get back the fourteen hours of growing frustration and annoyance we had spent watching it. BUT WE DID. And….
Everyone is entitled to their own feelings and opinions. This is ours. If we want to signify something to each other that should have been good and disappointed us completely, we use this as a reference now. Just saying.

I should have known after my experience with ""W"" (written by the same person) not to get my hopes too high, and this drama started very strong, but by the end I felt extremely disappointed. I felt the same way about ""W""... that this could have easily joined my list of favorite dramas, and there were so many elements to the story that I loved, but there were also too many things that could have been better. I can't say that I disliked ""Memories of the Alhambra"" but I can say that it didn't quite live up to the hype.

What I loved about the story is the main plot revolving around the augmented-reality videogame. It's hard to go to into it without giving away too much, but I loved the world they created, the unexpected twists in the story, and the mystery element that intrigued me to the very end. I also loved Hyun Bin! He was great as reluctant hero Yoo Jin Woo and always plays the charming jerk role so well. He is one of my favorites, and it was great to see him as a leading man again. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the leading lady.

Park Shin Hye as Jung Hee Joo is probably the thing I hated most about this drama. I can blame the writer for making her character so pathetic, but I really think a better actress could have made the role work. Even though I have liked her in other roles, in the drama she seemed out of her league. She had zero chemistry with Hyun Bin in my opinion, and he really seemed to be trying much harder to make their romantic storyline work while she basically cried and looked slightly surprised most of the time. He had much better chemistry with his assistant than with her, he even had better chemistry with the little sister, and since romance becomes a major element in the story it definitely added to my disappointment.

The rest of the cast, in general, was good but there were times when the side character stories seemed more like filler, made the story drag, and didn't hold my interest. Some of it made sense and added to the story, like the scandalous love triangle between the two bffs, and the father played by the always brilliant Kim Eui Sung, but most of the side stories just didn't live up to the excitement of the game world. I didn't care at all about Jin Woo's second wife or Hee Joo's friend zoned guy pal. I would have much rather learned more about the development of the game. I liked the show much more in the earlier episodes when there was more focus on just the game world.

I was also impressed by how this drama looked visually. The Spain locations were great, and the virtual world elements looked impressive and believable. I liked the incorporation of the Spanish guitar too which made a beautiful melody so creepy, especially if it happens to be raining while you're watching.

The rest of the soundtrack was just ok in my opinion.

Would I watch this again? Probably. The game world alone was entertaining enough to watch again, although I would be tempted to skip through all of Park Shin Hye's scenes where she isn't the mysterious Emma. Since the story jumps around in time so much it may be interesting to watch again knowing what's actually going on.

I also have to give a shoutout to the genius product placement! There were the usual blatant moments, of course, but the way some brands were incorporated into the story was pretty brilliant.

I also understand why people were disappointed with the ending but I was more indifferent. Parts of the end actually made me tear up, and other parts made me roll my eyes. It seemed more like a set up for a sequel than a real ending anyway, but I think they did their best to give most of the characters some kind of closure, even if I didn't care about some of them.

Overall, this is a drama where there may be plot holes, lapses in logic, an overuse of narration, and a love story that lacks chemistry, but it makes up for it in originality and intrigue. I was excited every week to watch the latest episode all the way up until the end, which honestly felt like it came too soon. So I would still recommend this drama, even with its flaws. It's another ambitious story that may not have lived up to its full potential, but it definitely stands out among other dramas.

I really hope to see Hyun Bin as a leading man again soon, with a better leading lady. I also look forward to the next sci-fi drama by this writer, because it may not have been as good as it should have been but it was certainly extremely memorable...

This drama has so much potential. It has a unique concept and a great storyline. It shows cinematic views, amazing soundtrack and talented set of actors. This is one of the most intense drama that I've watched. I remember looking forward to weekends so I can watch this. I cried, laughed and feel for the characters. Hyun Bin as ML was exeptional. You can see that he's one hell of an actor. His character has one of the best development and Hyun Bin as an actor was given a great opportunity to show different emotions. However, Park Shin Ye suffered from a poorly written character. I don't think it's the actress fault, it's not because she lacks the skill in acting. It's just how her character was written.

Memories of Alhambra ended with many questions left unanswered. This has the kind of ending that would like the viewers to think and conclude on their own. But it's impossible to do that with the many plot holes subjected for the sake of keeping the story interesting. There was no conclusion at all. No closure. It's like you're riding a fast car with a breathtaking view, but you never reach your destination. You go round and round (so many flashbacks and repetitive scenes) but the car just broke down, and left you stranded. That's how it feels. I'm not expecting an over the top happy ending. I know from the way it started, it might not end well. But atleast a decent ending that the characters and the viewers deserved should have been considered.

So if you're looking for a unique storyline with great cinematography and superb acting, you may give this a try.

But if you're looking for romance and happy endings, this one isn't for you.

This is my first drama review.
This is one kind of the drama where you will be addicted from the first episode. I started watching this drama with no much expectations but cannot wait until weekend for this drama after started watching.
This is not a regular Rich guy poor girl drama that made the plot very much engaging. Game lovers would love this drama more the me .
Things I dint like was , too much of repeated scenes (flashback ones) and the last two episodes was dull to me compared to the others, recommend this for all the Kdrama lovers :)

Girl leadership literally just cries. It is no exaggeration. The character of the game (Emma) is more useful than her. I hoped she would join the game but it never happened. Waste from ShinHye Park. Why hire such an expensive actress to cry and play the guitar?
Worst line of romance ever. It's unnatural and it seems like they got together just because they are protagonists and dramas happen like that. The male lead was an unpleasant character who should not have romance with anyone. I hated him in romantic pair. If it were interpreted by an ugly man, he would be unpleasant but as the actor is beautiful say he is ""cool and sexy"". Agh
The plot was very good. If you delete the girl leader and the romance line. But as always many important things have not been explained. The end is bad.
I recommend this drama if you want action and adventure. And do not care about bad explanations things.

Every single week I've been looking forward for this drama. Episode 1 was spectacular! The writer truly captivated the audience attention into making it addictive for viewers as myself.
Leaving you on a cliff hanger so its obvious that you will be anxious to know what's happening next.

Each episode was thrilling, it got me all excited and what not, but it was episode 14 that really 'hit' me. Seeing how Jin-woo Interacted with Hee-joo, the level of intamcy had me shook, happy, sad and bothered at the same time because I had a feeling that things would have ended baldy and for some reason its like Jin-Woo Was saying goodbye.
PLUS, seeing Se-joo coming back to be reunited with the family I just knew the outcome of Jin-woo would be devastating. Knowing what he had to and went through to get See-Joo back, ugh I was sad.

Now fast forward to the last episode, episode 16. All the other previous episodes were great, wonderful continuations but the 16th episode got me like
WTF, LIKE WTF. I knew the outcome of Jin-Woo Would not have turned out to be the best, but THIS BULLSHIT the writers gave me was not and will not be accepted. I thought that the last episode for crying out loud would have been EPIC, BUT its not, its pure crap. This is not the ending I was looking for. Why did he have to ""die"" why leave Hee-Joo In so much misery? At least they should have let him say goodbye to Hee-joo And finnaly part ways witheach other if needs be. Now that could have at least been a ""good"" ending and partially acceptable but him just shooting Bullets at the NPCs to save game users life does not make sense.

Why did the writer have an open ending? Is there hope for a second season? Because I think that many things were left unanswered and I need closure. If not, they should have a synoptic episode to explain what really happened to Jin-woo Because I know he's not dead, NPCs cannot attack each other so I know definitely that he's not dead. Also, the fact that Hee-joo was running towards the church and putting on her lens, will she be able to actually meet Jin-woo, see and feel him? So much need to be answered. Nevertheless its a wonderful drama and I recommend it to everyone.

WHAT I LIKED
The plot, the cinematography was on point, and the graphics of course was all good. The actors delivered their roles beautifully especially Hyun-Bin. The emotions he portrayed had me thinking that it was actually real. I always say that if an actor makes me feel what he's feeling, the ability to picture myself in the same scene is a phenomenal actor and Hyun-Bin did just that.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE
The ending, I think that the writers should have done a better job. There needs to be closure. Since Jin-woo had the key to heaven and he deleted the bugs but what about Marco, wasn't he a bug as well knowing to the fact that the error started with him? What I want to know is if he's bug is deleted then who deleted it.
Seeing that the last episode had an open ending maybe there might be a second season or a synoptic episode. All for now I don't know and I need answers.

Memories of the Alhambra is a wonderful drama with spectacular acting by each cast, if you have not seen it or are planning to I Trish Mish highly recommend it.

Memories of the Alhambra is an ambitious drama. It creates interest right from the start, with the mysterious disappearance of the creator of a live action game in Spain. Actually, the first two episodes were really good. As the viewer is trying to figure out what is going on and to understand the new technology and new drama genre that this drama introduces, the tension builts up and the action scenes become more and more. So, the good parts about this drama were : A) the game plot, B) the ending, C) the performances, D) SGI and action scenes. However, there were major wrongs about this one. First of all, the romance was weak and just wrong. They got together out of the blue and it is hard to believe that they developed feelings so strong to the point that they would worry so much for each other that it made them desperate. Also, the leading lady was really annoying. Not that the actress didn't play her role well. However, the script just killed the character. She ended up being this weak character who the only thing that did was worry about everyone and cry. And then there were the plot holes. Like, they just left their brother to another country, moved to Korea and a year later they remembered that he was missing (?!!). Finally, the plot was so slow paced that it felt like I was watching still the first episodes when the drama was halfway finished.
So, 5.5 out of 10, because this one had so much potential but the romance and the weak leading lady ruined it.

So I was really hyped about this drama. I couldn't wait for it to start airing. What a letdown..
It started out a bit interesting, but as the plot progressed the entire story turned into a mess. (not that virtual-real interactions were realistic from ep1 onward) Almost nothing makes sense in any way. It reminds me a bit of the disappointment I felt, when I watched The Matrix Revolutions, it has similar, but more pronounced problems. To summarize the script is just bad. People criticize Park Shin Hye for bad acting, but honestly I think she was fine here, it's not her fault that the writer made her character a 2d persona with very little substance, sure I admit that she isn't the best when it comes to crying in kdramaland, but come on .. Technically this is a tragedy/melodrama, but it's difficult to take it seriously, so the melodramatic moments lack impact for that reason. As I said the story is a jumbled mess and I cannot take it seriously despite me being rather tolerant for nonsense, I loved SaO season1 for example.

Im going to be honest I watched this drama because of Chanyeol but just finished this drama last night and really enjoyed it.
the plot is different and unique and each episode was thrilling (with some fillers) making you wonder what would happen next,
the visuals are amazing from CGI to the landscape, but not everything is perfect the only thing Im not a fan off was the romance I think they added it just because they can it felt a bit forced. And I wish Jung Hee Joo of done Less of the crying her tears alone could fill up the river themes.

the actors & actress did an amazing job Esp chanyeol it really bought the drama to life (:

I only decided to watch this drama because I'm from Spain and it was set in Granada. I'm not a fan of Hyun Bin, and even if I've seen Park Shin Hye more than four times already, I can't get to like her acting (and my opinion unluckily does not improve in this one).
First of all, it was strange to see a Korean drama in the streets, trains, buildings that are so common for me. On the other hand there were some incoherences for a Spanish watcher (as to see the train lines in Catalan language when they are in the South of Spain, or that many of the Spanish extras in the drama had latin american accent). I'm aware that Korean people would never know all this, but I think the production could have done a better work.
I liked the story very much, all the action around the game and the augmented reality. It was really good. I didn't like at all the pseudo romance, it was completely unnecessary.
About the acting, Hyun Bin was really good. The drama is about him, and he does what he should do. On the other hand, Park Shin Hye’s role was unnecessary too. She does not add anything to the story nor she helps the male lead in any way. And, moreover, they could have chosen somebody who could speak Spanish (as Seo Ye Ji who at least studied at the university in Spain). Nobody could believe that someone who had been in a different country for 12 years could speak the language so bad. Even her brother Se Jo was much much better when he spoke in Spanish.
I didn't expect anything else from the ending, so I can't say I'm disappointed. I don't think either that the male and female lead happy ending would be a good ending… but I understand the bad reviews about this though.
If you want to watch something slightly different, with a new sci-fi story, a lot of action and different settings, go for it. But don't expect too much from it.

i watched this in 2021...somehow i don't really feel the urge to watch this sooner. after subscribe on netflix, and searching for a drama, i found this and i think i'll give it a try....

STORY
the story itself is promising, in some parts, for example about the AR game, and everything about the AR, but...there's a huge hole about how they ended the drama.
1. the drama has an open end, and...i don't really like open end drama
2. all the problem is solved, but...without proper explanation. they should explain it in detail, and cutting some reminiscent scene.
3. i really really love the AR part...fighting and the grand idea about it. the execution towards the end is depressing.
4. i really love hyun bin storyline, really hate park shin hye part.

ACTING
i agree with some other review with hyun bin amazing acting, but park shin hye make me depressed. as i watch this, i think :
1. maybe the drama will be better without Female Lead as i feel that her presence more like supporting female and sometime she just being a burden.
2. there's no spark and chemistry between FL and ML...mostly because FL i think. cause...when it comes to acted solo, the ML do his job perfectly.
3. i can blame the story for making the FL so depressing...but...on the screen, all she do is shock, look dumb, clueless, crying...maybe, just maybe...another actress can make the oh so frustrating female character better.
4. as i watch the FL, i remember seeing her in Pinocchio and the Heir, and i think her acting look exactly the same...maybe it's just my subjective opinion.

MUSIC
not much i remember, the memories of the alhambra play multiple time it feels like i can still hear it as i write this. LOL
but, adding music as a sign/reminder is a smart little detail.

REWATCH
me myself, have a lot of drama list to watch, so no...i really can't stand seeing FL in here. but maybe, just maybe i'll watch it again for the action and the AR, skipping the parts with FL.
i'm sorry, the FL just doesn't add any value in here. i think this dramas succeeded more because ML hard work and superb acting, story idea, amazing cinematography and CGI.
like i said, i even thinking this drama will still be amazing even without FL in it.

I was rooting for you, we were ALL rooting for you
Well, this is what I get for choosing to watch a drama based only on kpop boys..

Actually, that's not entirely fair. This drama had a lot of promise, but unfortunately it missed on a couple notes. From the beginning, the plot is quite fun and engaging, especially with those beautiful Spanish backdrops. But once we leave the European setting, things start to go downhill.

One of my biggest problems with this drama lies with the romance story. While the main couple are obviously not the main part of this show, their relationship is a strong driving force for the plot and the drama is marketed as a fantasy romance thriller so I will treat it as such.

I would say what's wrong with the couple but I think that saying what's right with them would be quicker.. From the start there is no spark between the two characters. But this continues right through the relationship. There's almost no connection between the two, and the way they end up 'dating' is so casual that I didn't even realise it was a confession scene. This wouldn't be such a huge problem, as at the end of the day, this is mainly a fantasy thriller, IF the ending didn't rely so heavily on the romance. Which leads me to my biggest gripe with this show.

The ending. Honestly this last episode completely baffled me, I have no idea what was happening. The worst part of this show is without a doubt the last five minutes. By this point, we have already accepted that Jin Woo has died, but this has no effect, the death of the main character has no impact on the viewer. Honestly, if the show just ended like that with a sad ending I maybe wouldn't even be writing this review but instead they chose to shove an quick explanation for how he could have survived and shoe horn in a sequel bait ending scene of the female lead running to meet him. I just don't understand why this would be left to so far at the end, its just confusing and even more unsatisfying than the already unsatisfying conclusion we would have without this last five minutes.

I was so rooting for this show too, but unfortunately I was disappointed.

I know this drama is still airing but i have watched it from the beginning and it has not failed me yet. Its suspenseful romantic sweet and creative. Everytime i watch a new episode I'm impressed and i love it even more. This drama belongs with the highly rated shows. I love it because the idea of the show is extremely creative, new and the actors have really taken these roles to another level. The actors honestly convinced me. I cried when they did and loved it when they smiled. It warmed my heart. You will be hooked once you give it a chance. Definitely one of my favss!!!

'Nough said!! Stop what you're doing and go watch it!!!!! Then come back and tell me you agree with me.

Not the worst, but not great
This drama had so much potential and the first few episodes were great. However, after episode 5 or so, it goes downhill pretty fast.

The story became a mess, they've tried to pack it with too much stuff but never really bothered to actually build the fondation of each part strongly, the romance part being the worst one. I don't mind watching a drama with no much romance, but at least do it properly. It feels forced and/or it comes from nowhere.

As other said, Hee-ju's character doesn't do much and it gets really frustrating. You have a good actress and do nothing more than make her cry all the time? (On an unrelated note, I really don't like the shoes she wears in the whole drama and watching her run in these is even more annoying)

I watch until episode 11 and decided that my time was to precious to bother trying to finish it. The story not only was a mess at this point but they started to drag the plot so much, I couldn't take it anymore. Not the worst drama I watched however, there's still some reedeming qualities here and there, but at some point, I lost interest and didn't enjoy any of it.

My advice, if you still want to try, is to be attentive to how much you're enjoying the show after episode 5, so you can drop it early if needed unlike me who tried until episode 11 for no good reason.

I'm a sucker for writer Song Jae Jung ever since watching Nine: Nine Times Time Travel. She has a knack for creating compelling stories with awesome twists and turns and keeping viewers glued and breathless in front of their screens. Memories of the Alhambra is no exception and the casual gamer that I am fell in love from the get go with yet another winner in her filmography.
This being said, Memories of the Alhambra suffers from some issues... which are recurrent with this writer.

Story: 8

Without spoiling, It's a captivating story which will keep you on your toes to the end but it does contain some issues:

1. The romance is at its weakest. It's actually a problem I've been having with all her dramas and that includes Queen In Hyun's man whom people apparently loved the romance overall. This writer is not really good when it comes to romance, it feels forced instead of organic and after watching 4 of her dramas, it's now pretty obvious the problem lies in the writing and not the cast. I think I'd have liked it better if our two mains had remained friends instead of lovers.

2. Park Shin Hye is a potted plant. It's unfortunate that she is not used more efficiently throughout the story. It's a pity she could not have a more prominent role when W: Two Worlds gave Han Hyo Joo such a great involvement in the story. Here we're following Hyun Bin's journey and Park Shin Hye is merely his anchor. By the end of the series, she does get a more prominent role but it's too little too late.

3. Pacing Issues: One of the thing I had some hard time with Nine: Nine Times Time Travel was the breakneck speed of the story. This writer is great in that area but she's yet to perfect how to put some ""breathing room"" for her characters. In Nine, there was almost none, in W, too little, in Memories of the Alhambra, not that many... but felt overly long. Some episodes felt really slow compared to others. It just feels like she's yet to find the right balance in that area.

This being said, it's a strong 8 overall plotwise. Song Jae Jung is one of these few writers in dramaland who always comes up with something surprising that reinvent the thriller genre. I'll be anticipating her next project

Acting/Cast: 10

Wonderful job from the whole cast but the biggest applause goes to Hyun Bin's who is basically carrying the whole drama on his shoulders. From successful CEO to fearful and paranoid wreck, to wanted man, we feel his fears, anxiety and dread watching his life crumbling under his feet.
Very happy he made a successful come back in dramaland after the disaster that was Hyde Jekyll, Me.

Music/Sound: 9.5

Who would have though that a peaceful guitar sound would be such a fearful experience?

Rewatch Value: 9

Overall: 9

So far my favorite Song Jae Jung's drama remains W. The pacing issues and the fact that Park Shin Hye who is the co-lead was underused are my biggest complains. Some people might be disappointed by the open ending. I for one felt it was coherent and very faithful to the story itself. Unlike romantic comedies, great Fantasy/Science Fiction thrillers often leave rooms for the imagination. It's a nice open end... But I wouldn't say ""No"" to a second season.

If you're in for the romance, just forget this drama. You're not watching this for the romance unless you want to be sorely disappointed. Memories of the Alhambra is a thriller through and through, a well written, well-rounded, well-acted thriller with compelling characters, awesome twists and cliffhangers which will leave you on the edge of your seat. Worth its hype and its ratings.

Why this story so focused on romance story? I think story about AR Game and secret behind are more related, dude ... i mean why the writer just focused on that? Ex: how you can die on these game? how you can really die in reality version? how the creator on this game can fix this problem? not just and only focused on romance story, so much wasted material just like that. I think story on Sword art online anime, much better than this trash drama.

STORY
The drama itself is interesting and it a different kind of fantasy. I like the idea of VR story, and at first, it was confusing, and after episodes, they start to wrapped the story. I really like the story itself. It like the anime I watched, it has the same idea, but different twist. For k-drama addicts, this story is completely different.

CAST
The cast has amazing chemistry. Park Shin Hye did it again. She did a phenomenal acting job, never disappointing.

OVERALL
It was amazing drama, this is a completely different story and concept!!!!!

guys, I always joke that I know when it's a good or bad drama within the first couple of episodes but trust me on this, I honestly believe its a talent. lmao. tell me otherwise but it's actually so good.

Story:
Se Joo develops a game with a friend he met online and soon they decide to sell it to Hyun Suk, the rival company against J One. After an accident, Se Joo rings Jin Woo and tells him that he is willing going to sell the game to him as Hyun Suk is a bad person. Confused and not wanting the game to go into the hands of his ex-best friend, he goes to Granada overnight from Barcelona in the hope to negotiate with Se Joo. He arrives at a hostel that is owned by Hee Joo and demands that he needs to stay there, even after Hee Joo said she'll recommend other nice hotel around the area for him, he still declined and so she let him stayed. Not knowing Hee Joo is Se Joo's older sister, they both start with an unwelcoming greeting. Jin Woo finds out Se Joo is missing and so the search to find Se Joo embarks. // This is basically the gist of the drama, like throughout the drama its about finding where Se Joo and Jin Woo leveling up in the game to find Se Joo. I actually really enjoy the plot of this drama, it's so different which is why it is worth it to invest the time to watch it. I was very skeptical about watching it even though it was on my plan to watch list, but I decided to watch it with my brother and I kid you not, so far it's the best korean drama for end/beginning of the year drama. At first you will be very confused with all the going back and forth scenes but they are very important and critical to the story. Like I was very confused and honestly think it was very unnecessary but the more I watched it the more I was thanking them for those scenes as it made it more clearer and very understanding to the situation. Although I do wish the leads have more romance but I feel like it was really well spread out and the romance they had was already cute enough so I don't really care. haha. Also the ending is very open so it is honestly free for your own interpretation. At first I was very disappointed about it but I guess the write really want to give you that feeling of what's going to happen next, do the meet, do they not, and so on, but it really is up to you on how you want to end the drama. So much hate in the comments but I mean like everyone is entitle to their own opinions sooo meh. p.s spoiler...the saddest part in the drama was when secretary Jung Hoon dies, he did not need to die to make the drama amazing.

Acting/Cast:
The cast was amazing. bonus for Hyun Bin's look like omg like he was just a whole mood. everytime he comes on he was just soooooooo pleasing to look at. & MVP awards goes to Jung Hoon.
HeeJoo: SeJoo's older sister, the money maker for the family.
JinWoo: CEO of JOne Group, divorcee twice,/ thinks he is always right but no dude.
SeJoo: game developer, / you only see him once in a blue moon. haha
HyunSuk: JinWoo's ex-friend, co-founder of JOne Group, marries to Jin Woo's first wife.
Jung Hoon: Jin Woo's secretary, the MVP in the drama.

Music:
I rated 10 but honestly I can't really remember the music.

Rewatch Value:
I probably will, when I have a throwback season.

Overall:
It's a really different type of drama that will either catches your attention or be a miss if you're not into it. I guess you can say if you're into gaming you will find it that it talks to you or even if you're a fan of the cast then it will definitely catches your attention. lucky for me I'm both so everything was eye candy. haha.

Honestly shocked there are no reviews for this on MDL yet. I haven't seriously watched KDrama in a while, usually can't seem to find the time Or I can't get into it. If I get bored Around episode 1-3 I'm bad about dropping it.
That is Not the case with Memories of the Alhambra . I binged so hard. I am blown away and obsessed at this point. Always at the end of the episode dying to watch the next on the edge of my seat! I haven't seen Hyun Bin since Hyde Jekyll Me and it's great to see him again , and of course Park Shin Hye! I have been waiting for a new drama with her starring as a main character and they are both doing amazing jobs in MOA! The gameplay is epic and makes me want to join in and play it too! I won't go into detail because of spoilers, but give this drama a try if your wanting to fall in love with kdrama again or just love Hyun Bin/Park Shin Hye/VR Gaming/Sword Art Online!

I never wrote review for any drama. But I had to write something for memories of Alhambra. To be honest I dont how to express my feelings for this drama. Firstly I started to watch it because hyun bin is the lead actor and I love him. Also the pair look so fresh and beautiful together. But each week the story keeps drawing me in more and more. The story and way of telling the story, the cast, the beautiful cinematography and never seen before awesome AR is sooo interesting for me. And hyun bi-shin hye couple makes me so delusional, I want them to get married in real life. On top of that eveRY actor in the drama showed top notch acting including my babY chanyeol. I hope it get the applause it deserves for presenting something so fresh and new. BEST DRAMA of 2018/19 FOR ME.

Beautiful drama. The writer is a genius. I was constantly on the edge of my seat and didn't skip a single second what NEVER happened before. I'm honestly thinking this is the best Korean Drama I have ever seen in my life and I have seen many over the last 10 years. I can imagine people aren't fully sold on this, because 1) they don't like the gaming theme, 2) they watched this mostly because of the love story and – to be honest – the love story wasn't overwhelming and 3) they were disappointed in the ending which has a lot to do with number 2. I'm personally not a fan of those gaming series either. Since I watch Japanese anime for over two decades now, I know very well that this is a popular genre. Seeing some medieval soldier coming to life and having a sword fight with Hyun Bin somewhere in Spain made me almost drop the series (I'm really not into this stuff), but everything is so incredible well done, that you cannot stop watching. The directing, the music, the acting – this is flawless. Hyun Bin did a great job. Everyone was doing great. About the love story: It was nice. But this wasn't the strongest part of the story which is okay. I never got tired of Hyun Bin being the tragic hero, I never got annoyed by the girl being rather helpless. This couple worked out pretty well. For such a tragic hero a woman who supports him emotionally is the best writing choice. The strength of the story lies in the whole gaming theme and how one detail after another gets revealed. The strength lies in the psychological aspects of the story, the deep and complex relationship between the characters, the whole life-threatening scenario. This was such a great watch. I‘m still in awe of this incredible series after finishing it an hour ago.

DECODING MEMORIES OF THE ALHAMBRA: ECHOES OF THE MATRIX (Abbreviated Version)
Part I - Memories of the Alhambra (MOTA) echoes Matrix not only because it is an action filled science fiction thriller, but because it is a fable whose main characters possess similar purposes. Kdrama’s first foray utilizing Augmented Reality (AR) is an ambitious project for a television drama and a refreshingly philosophical and spiritual treasure. While Matrix is a story about control and authority, MOTA serves as a treatise on human behavior. MOTA advances the idea that man must transcend his lower nature by knowing himself in order to benefit the greater good.

MOTA IS A PHILOSOPHICAL. RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL TRILOGY
This hauntingly beautiful drama pairs a video game with AR triggering several philosophical questions as did Matrix. MOTA stealthily delves into branches of philosophy (i.e.- metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and logic). Similar to Matrix, it tackles religious ideology, referencing Christianity and Islam, and employs religious symbolism and iconography. Though the religious symbolism seems very surface initially, a detailed review reveals the brilliance of pairing state of the art technological concepts with ancient principles and wisdom. Gleaned and preserved by Greek philosophers, this knowledge from the Ancient Egyptian Mystery System was eventually carried into Spain by the Moors, who brought Europe out of the Dark Ages. This makes the fact that the drama is initially set in Spain very appropriate.
Just as Song meshes several genre, themes and religions, the screenwriter interlocks the philosophical ideas, such that you cannot consider one without the other. The spiritual ideas are woven seamlessly into the story. Following is an example of the metaphysics used in the drama:
The AR game’s world and the real world of the drama begs questions about the rules of the AR game and its impact on the real world. When questioning rules, we are in the territory of metaphysics. MOTA wastes no time in immersing the audience in a guessing game. Just as the IT Manager Choi Yang Ju, Master Jung Seeju and Yoo Jinwoo, begin to ask how certain things are possible, the audience too questions possibilities when Seeju and Jinwoo interact with the game. Jinwoo presents the audience a third world to be concerned with, that of the “crazy,” which has its on rules.

Part II - MOTA v. Matrix - Characters in MOTA share some of the same features as characters in the Matrix. Jinwoo is MOTA’s Thomas Anderson/NEO. Albeit fearful and youthful Jung Seeju the maker of the game represents the Architect; the teenage Jung Minju represents the Oracle in the real world; Jung Heejoo represents the sacred feminine energy similar to Trinity; and instead of a self-composed, regal Morpheus, the quirky IT Manager Choi serves as Jinwoo’s mentor. Following are a few example of how MOTA echoes Matrix:
1. Jinwoo is “The One”, it’s spelled out in plain sight with his company name, JOne, just as Neo is the One if you change the letters around in his name;
2. When we are first introduced to Jinwoo, he is awakened from sleep by a telephone call. In the Matrix, Thomas Anderson/Neo is shown as being asleep at the beginning of the movie. Sleep symbolizes a state of unawareness or unconsciousness.
3. When Jinwoo was sedated after his injury, Minju tells Jinwoo that he only wanted Heejoo to care for him, no one else. So, in his unconscious state Jinwoo knew how important it was for him to be with Heejoo, but he did not know the reason. Minju also told Jinwoo that she had given him a new nickname, the Master, just as The Oracle talked to Neo about being the One.

Part III - SPIRITUAL MUSINGS: MYSTERY SYSTEMS
So, is MOTA an allegory? Does it have a meaning? In order to make a determination as to whether it has a meaning or not it is necessary to review the symbolism in MOTA. Ancient Egypt birthed the seven Hermetic Laws and teachings of virtues. This too is where we can find knowledge cultivated by secret societies. It is within this information that we decode the meaning of MOTA:

1. Jinwoo inserting the JOne contact lens into his right eye brings to mind Neo peering from his apartment, #101, using his right eye. In Ancient Egypt, the right eye is “The Eye of Ra” a powerful destructive force of the sun. IT Manager Choi asks Jinwoo when he removes the lens, “is it hot?”. On the other hand the left eye is depicted as the “Eye of Horus,” “the all-seeing eye,” of protection. The all-seeing eye sees into the spirit world. So, obviously the JOne lenses represent the all-seeing eye and sees into the AR game world, the spirit world.
2. Jinwoo Knocked off His Square - A square is composed of four 90 degree angles. The four angles equal 360 degrees. In some secret societies it signifies the foundation of all knowledge. In Ancient Egypt, it is also said to represent the higher and lower nature. At the beginning of the drama, after Jinwoo arrives in Granada to test the game, wearing the lenses, Jinwoo watches an Aragon Warrior ride up to him on a horse. The Warrior has been shot in the back with six arrows and falls dead from the horse. The horse with its four legs epitomizes the square. The warrior riding the horse symbolizes a man that has risen above and overcame his lower nature. Obviously, him falling off the horse signifies him having succumbed to his lower nature. This event serves as an omen for Jinwoo. It signifies Jinwoo losing his ability to control his lower nature. In the drama the number six arises at least three times. As stated the Aragon Warrior had six arrows in his back, Jinwoo’s, room number 601, at the hostel is on the sixth floor, and when he and Hyeon-Seok (his old friend and enemy) prepare to duel he mentions that they have had six challenges. Jinwoo eventually falls the six flights down. Once again, the sixes operate as a warning. In some sacred circles, the sum total 666 equals the lower nature. In the Bible six is considered a sign of human weakness and sin.
3. Like Trinity in the Matrix, Heejoo provides the compassion and love that can only be given by the sacred feminine energy that Jinwoo seeks and needs in order to transcend his lower nature. Heejoo is passive and emotional, unlike Trinity, but both women stay in distress in the respective movies. Heejoo worries, runs and cries though out MOTA. Law of Opposites – Principle of Polarity, it is necessary to point-out that MOTA cannot be told without a romance. Some viewers of the drama state that they felt the romance was unnecessary, because they were more interested in the AR game. Heejoo symbolizes the feminine principle and is Jinwoo’s opposite. Throughout the drama on several occasions, Heejoo and Jinwoo stood opposite of and staring at each other. Heejoo embodied the compassion and love that Jinwoo sought. It was when Jinwoo kissed Heejoo for the first time that he accepted love and started operating based upon his heart.

There is more symbolism in MOTA, for example the injuring of Jinwoo's left leg, etc. that tell us about this very thought-provoking drama. Actors, Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye provided excellent performances. My criticisms are that we needed to see more of Park Shin Hye's character in action and explanations for the unexplained phenomena.
I believe this drama is underrated, because several people do not understand its meaning, which goes beyond the AR game. I definitely recommend watching MOTA.

Unique
This drama had a very unique concept! It was different! the first few episodes were slow but then it got more interesting the more you watch it! the few downfalls were there was a lot of flashbacks in this drama I found myself fast forwarding through them all and I didn’t find it necessary to have any romance in this drama it just seem like an after thought. All of the FL scenes she was pretty much just crying it was annoying to watch after a while and I also fast forward through that. Not a lot of people like the ending but I didn’t mind it at all.

I wasted 16 hours of my life
The MC got his leg broke, haunted by the game, reputation ruined, framed for murder, fired, then the writer killed him off at the end like hey he solved it so all the BS we put him through was justified like what the hell? I hate writers that write dumb unrealistic plots like these, while the main female and her bro is still alive and well and got the 10 billion. THEY RUINED THE MC’S LIFE FOR 16 EPISODES, not one positive thing happened to him until the end so if you’re watching him take all the BS and expecting an uplifting ‘it was all worth it’ turn around towards the end. Don’t watch this. The MC gets shat on for 16 episodes.

Did not intend to watch this due to Park Shin Hye being one of the cast, she has spoiled many almost great kdramas for me so has become quite a turn-off. Decided to give this a go after seeing reviews for the drama. Personally, I felt that the synopsis for this drama did not give it justice, synopsis simply wasn't interesting enough for a click. Thank goodness for viewer reviews. Surprisingly, this was a very captivating and exhilarating ride, especially if you like playing RPG games. Each episode was a great hook. This drama would be perfect and better received with a different lead actress, in my personal opinion. But still, I give this a 10, kudos.

Amazing acting on all fronts (especially Hyun Bin), but I agree with most that Park Shin Hye should not have been cast in this drama. She was too underutilized and there is not much room to ACT when your character barely has anything to do. The AR game is also very well explored and fun to watch, until the second half where every battle feels like a slog. But if they are trying to mimic painful level grinding in your watch experience, then I have nothing to say. Hats off to the action choreographers.

Great soundtrack, each ost fits the scene very well, and Memories of Alhambra's beautifully haunting tune still brings me the chills, 16 episodes in.

And that is about it for the pros. The story is so clumsily constructed, and the show feels like it's trying to be clever without actually knowing how to write a decent non-linear story. You can basically start a drinking game halfway through the show: every time a character sees something shocking, or before a cliffhanger, down a shot. Then wait for the annoying Spongebob ""10 hours earlier"" chyron to flash across the screen. Sluggishly paced, not much happens in an episode and the show constantly breaks its own rules, or makes up new rules whenever it likes. Half of the cast is completely unnecessary, not enjoyable to watch, and the important halves' characterization is horribly underdeveloped. Might as well use up the same thinking power as Sword Art Online.

Final note: the romance is forced, incomprehensible and inexplicable. He should have ended up with his secretary.

This is an oh so good, edge of your seat suspense drama with a dash of romance and modern yet timeless piece. Smart story plot and some gorgeous main characters makes for perfect chemistry but not taking away from the main story line.

It's beautifully filmed, directed and the music... it's hauntingly beautiful and fits the series.

Every week I literally and patiently wait for more episodes. I can't recall the last time I was so hooked to a Korean tv series on Netflix. It's a must watch! Consider yourself warned as it's addictive!

Many Promises, But Unkept
[As I have watched this while airing, I risk being disproportionately influenced in this review by the last two episodes in my story score, episodes which have left me needing a palate cleanser. However, unlike the show I will not use flashbacks but take it chronologically.]
Memories of the Alhambra uses a brilliant premise of augmented reality gone wrong and weaves cliffhangers and shocking twists in a manner that leaves viewers hooked, especially around the middle of the series. The technology imagined is not that farfetched and it was actually fun to brainstorm with others on MDL how it could really be happening scientifically. The buildup is a bit slow but the problem that our hero has to solve is so interesting and so confounding that it makes one keep racing to know what will happen next. The romance is not a big part of the story but is rather a relief from the pretty grim realities of the situation as it is developing. The main antagonist is the game itself and it is quite good at that. What the hero grapples with is really quite unnerving and chilling to imagine.
Hyun Bin as Yoo Jin Woo is very convincing and the action scenes in which he fights multiple assassins are good stuff. His playful teasing and self-deprecating humour mix with a high intellect, arrogance and recklessness to create a pretty irresistible combination. The drama rests on his shoulders, with him singlehandedly battling both the real world and the AR world. He also excels at being uncaring, aloof, and mysterious whose rare displays of affection completely bowl Park Shin Hye. PSH as Jung Hee Joo tries to make the best out of a poorly written role. She has to cry way too much and contributes pitifully little to the plot. She is a hardworking, empathetic and very ‘normal’ girl but not quite a strong female lead everyone is more accustomed to nowadays. Chanyeol looks every bit his part as the nerdy, anxious and scared software genius but he could have been utilized better, especially towards the end. Lee Seung Jun as the loyal friend who does not know what or whom to believe is very good. Min Joo Woong leaves a lasting impression as Jin Woo’s secretary and ally (pun intended). Lee Re as the younger sister of PSH is very cute and her exchanges with our protagonist are some of the funniest bits of the series. I also enjoyed some other support characters; Choi Yang Ju as the programmer and primary aide to Jin Woo’s efforts in the game, displays a very funny and awkward crush on PSH’s virtual avatar; and Han Bo Reum as Gu Yu Ra is quite pleasing to the eye as the idiotic and unpredictable bimbo. Yet, some important support characters get surprisingly little character development. Their motivations are ill-explained and backstories are weak to non-existent. Things just happen. Se Jun is a classic example; she is ostensibly an important character but we seldom know what is really going on with her.
My favourite part of the show was after the 50% mark and it seemed set for a very exciting ending. Yet, it seemed that the writers were working with a concept that as beyond their skills to execute. So, they resorted to killing time towards the end and giving very loose explanations. There was the promise of much more story but instead, a handful of major events were narrated very slowly. There should have been much more happening. The romance had been finally coming into its own around Episode 11-12 (with a pretty good kiss scene) but it was just thrown out suddenly. So was all the humour towards the end. The original game developer’s way of planning the game was untouched and the alternate dimension thing could only have been acceptable in a drama that was not taking itself too seriously. Like the series itself, the pacing of the fight sequences was highly variable; some got it right (the train sequence was quite good) while others were implausibly slow.
This show would have been better if it did not try to integrate K Drama with an American-type show. Either it should have had half the length and followed the American model of lots of characters and lots of stuff happening across cliffhangers or it should have had the existing 16 (or more) episodes with well-written characters whom the viewer understands and cares for. As it ended, I suddenly realized we do not anything about what is happening with almost anyone in the show. We are merely aware of incidents but don’t know or care about anyone making it easy to just shrug off the drama indifferently. After all, the ending seemed as if sadistically contrived to not leave any happy feelings, and quite unreasonably at that. Unlike Nine, we do not have enough cute and happy moments, or smartly cluttered plot points placed during the series that may warrant a re-watch.
Yet, the show is quite innovative in many areas and so with the option of rapidly forwarding through torturous areas, I would recommend it as a watch. Just do not expect too much as you my feel cheated. The show is successful in using the overseas location of Granada. The production values are top-notch and I have quite enjoyed the OST.

This one is very unusual drama, witch will take you to a great ride! Especially if you are tired from cheesy cliche romcoms! If you're here for romance, you won't get 100% of it, romance is not the principal line! If you are here for sci-fi and action, you'll definitely love it! If you're not that much of sci-fi, you'll love it too, because sci-fi in this drama is not sci-fi you usually see ( robots, aliens etc..), it's something that haven't been done before! Plus sci-fi line is blended pretty well with the other lines, so you'll get all of it in one package..
The main star of this drama is definitely Jin Woo, played by Hyun Bin! He was amazing, and carried his scenes perfectly! I didn't like him so much before, but in this drama I was smitten by him! He starts as a typical kdrama rich male lead- a little full of himself, a little jerk, but I promise, you'll change your opinion about him after a few episodes! This story is totally his story, almost to the point he was the only lead in this drama, and the others were supporting..
Can't say a lot about Park Shin Hye here - exactly because of the reasons I just said - her role wasn't strong enough like the male lead role, she was more like second to him.. We all know, she is good actress, don't think I have to mention it, it's just her character here was overshadowed by the male lead.
Chanyeol ( no one mentioned him, so I wanna say a few words) - he also didn't get much spot, his character appeared mostly in flashbacks, untill the final episodes, but what he did, he did good! He totally transformed into geeky introverted computer genius, if I didn't know him well, I would never recognize Park Chanyeol in this character! :) But ( it's one of the things I wanted to complain to the writers) I wish his character gets a little bit more important scenes, because he started as important one, but ended being the guy from the flashbacks :)
The music was beautiful, especially the 1st ost , Little Prince, and Memories Of The Alhambra, played by Spanish guitar! I won't forget the creepy scene that was accompanied by this song! :)
Overall I really liked it, it was so original, non heavy, non cheesy, suspense was on point- I never knew what is going to happen next - I really enjoyed my ride with this drama! There were many complaints about the ending - I do think it was weaker than the entire drama, but it was still good, and non cliche..
Please, at least give it a try, because if you won't , you'll miss something special!

Incredible concept but atrocious realization
Things I liked.
* Production (Animation, lighting etc.)
* Actors

Things I disliked:
* Story writing and the logic behind it


Let me start of with the idea behind the drama, which was incredible and had so much possibilities.. but how could they do it like this.

The story started off very interesting, with something new, never seen before and incredible production but they ran it down real fast after about ep5.
The series had so many logic flaws and while it's a fantasy show, you still need an incredible amount of fantasy to make sense of the story writing. The start of the main plot is streched to the max. There are more than 4 eps where nothing really happens.

I won't go into more detail, but the drama had an insane amount of logic flaws and bad writing which never really made sense.

5-6 eps are really enjoyable
6-7 eps are hot garbage
the rest is a mix between these both

I'll actually watch the second season if they release it as the production value was real good but I hope they will do better explanation of the plot as you could delete half the eps to replace them with actual valuable information to make sense out of the story.

Bottom line:
Hot garbage

There's a lot of conflicting views out there whether to watch Alhambra or not. I just want to say I don't regret all the hours with Jin Woo and Hee Ju, and given the chance I'll watch it for the first time all over again. I'll always remember the thrill that came with watching each new episode.

So what is Alhambra exactly? It explores what happens when a guy gets involved in a game which becomes a nightmarish reality. From the moment, Hyun Bin as rich CEO Jin Woo comically dragged his heavy suitcase up the long flight of stairs of Hostal Bonita, I was in for the ride.

There's simply nothing like Alhambra in dramaland yet, and I hope it starts a genre trend. It's mainly a scifi thriller with a futuristic theme, but at its heart it's still about very human things like love, family, and friendship kdramas excel at. There's a tragic tone throughout, but there's lightness and hope amidst it all.

Finally, Hyun Bin is worth the watch alone. He is the heart and soul of this show. Jin Woo is Memories of the Alhambra. His unforgettable performance here is truly one for the books and will leave a mark in your kdrama-loving heart.

This review may contain spoilers
I am not usually sharing my review or opinion to shows I have watched, but I cannot help myself from typing after the episode 16 of Memories of the Alhambra. At the first time I heard it will be aired in Netflix, I was hesitant to try it as I am not really a fan of sci-fi dramas. My love for Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye as actors is the only reason why I tried it.
Early episodes stirred already my interest to really finish the story (luckily by the time I watched, the finale has been aired, so I can finish it on my own time), the mysteries kept my excitement throughout the show. Then I realized that it did not involve too much love story between the two leading actors. The main point of the story is about the game and the effect of it to the lives of the characters. I admire how the story went, the plot is really interesting for me, the twists and suspense are great. For me, the story caught my whole attention that even in my time to bed, I thought of what will happen in the next episode especially during the middle part. I was really not prepared of the revelations. The flashbacks are great, you can also expect a lot of it that will make you really think and go back to what happened. But as I go on with the last 3 episodes, I already prepared myself for a sad ending, (To be honest I read articles and reviews of the ending prior to continuing episode 14, but even so I already felt it will be going to be sad even before episode 11.)
I respect how the writer want the story to end. It his/her idea as a storyteller and a masterpiece will be finished/created according to the viewpoint of an artist regardless of what the majority of the audience will think. Although it could have ended happily if Jin-woo is alive since his character (Zinu) was really the one who died, and how come that he is also a bug? Hyeong-seok, the secretary, and Prof Cha were bugs since they appear even after their death, but how about our poor Jin-woo. It could have been ended with Jin-woo returning to the real word after deleting the bugs and restarting the game, then eventually live happily ever after with Hee-Joo. Luckily, I am hopeful, as the ending revealed of possible things that can happen eventually (really hoping for season 2 :)), like the possibility that Jin-woo will return to the real world since he still visible at times in the game. I also believe that he is still alive since his body was not found unlike the three bugs. Se-Joo can help Jin-woo get out of the dungeon (dimension where he may be in, after becoming the master) since he will be now part of J-One and will be back to developing the game and he is the creator of the game to start with. Some of the assumptions can also be made like Marco was deleted by Emma maybe since he is also bug; and they cannot make Se-Joo (he is the creator anyway) accountable for the deaths since the game was reset.
The ending is really tragic, I really cried especially when Hee-Joo kept on going to the church. It was so painful and very sad that it ended that way but thankfully some scenes were given to audience to end the story at whatever they want (a happy ending of course, and I have my own ending and a season 2 in my mind already). I will not recommend this to people who loves rom-com dramas and love story and those who hate action & suspense. The romance is not the focus of this series but what we can take home from their love is that trust will bloom love, it is vital in every relationship. I think Jin-woo fell in love with Hee-Joo because of her unconditional love, that even the whole world turned him down and did not anymore believe him, there will always be Hee-Joo on his side who will take care of him, who will trust him, and will not give up on him. But if you are an open-minded person, I think you may love it too. The concept, plot and actors are great, I am giving it a 10/10. The ending is 9/10 since of course I also wanted a happy ending personally. Details like customs, props, scenes are at 8/10 (haha don't mind this, I am just keen on some things sometimes, like how come she already wore her sneakers when she rushed going outdoors). Overall it will be at 10/10.

A must watch. Beautiful story telling, great locales, excellent acting. Edge of the seat drama. Hope they can keep this up. I never ever watch on air shows as my one experience was a huge dissappointment plus I hate waiting. This one is worth it.
If I had any quibble, it would be about the personality of Jee Su; a female lead seems a bit lame. She seems to cry too much and though I think the intention of the writer was to show her as innocent, kind and compassionate, it was never really made clear as to what made her suddenly decide to care about him; the transition was too abruput. But their relationship is beautiful once you accept that it exists however they arrived at that state.
The fights are gorgeous, and the story wonderful. And what do I say about the always talented Mr Kim Tae Pyung?

Spoiler ahead

His portrayal of an ambitious, slightly wolfish, tough business man who is then transformed into a hunted man, consumed by his fight with NPC s that only he can see, and the wits he uses while the world refuses to understand - absolutely on point.

This show is one of the best K Dramas that I have seen yet! So many twists and turns throughout the entire show and it is very unpredictable. The graphics are amazing and this is all worth a high re-watch value. Even though it might not be one that I will re-watch right away, I will definitely watch it again sometime. The acting is amazing, and the cast really put time and effort into their characters. Besides the sad parts mixed in, learning of the characters backstories was and amazing experience as they all were different and unique. This drama really has all you need in show from mystery, romance, action, passion, and even comedy! A lot of the show incorporated real places in the world and that made it feel all the more realistic. This is definitely a must watch and I can guarantee that you will not regret it!

Watched this while it’s on-going. 11/10 would recommend!!!! At first, I felt like it has the same vibe as W and got super amazed then I only learned mid-drama that both drama were written by one writer that’s why they have the same vibes. Super crazy plot! I honestly couldn’t quite catch what’s going on in the first few episodes, I thought I was going stupid and going crazy myself but got a hang of it din later on. Super genius! Everything is astounding… except the ending. LOL I’M SO MAD!!!!

I decided to delay watching the finale for a week to “emotionally prepare” myself but I never thought I would be betrayed like this??? Had I known, I would have prepared for a month. Have already watched tons and been watching kdramas for several years already, I shouldn’t be surprised and disappointed to open-ended stories anymore BUT I AM!!!???!!! So proud of Chanyeol here and my girl, Park Shin Hye, still never disappoints!

ONE RARE theme
This drama's theme is so rare and unique.You wont find it often..Lead actors were world class.Their chemistry was worth enough to watch the whole drama.
The Augmented Reality theme which they have researched on is amazing.This might be the future with Elon Musk providing the hint of Brain chips
I would love to give a 8 on 10 on this.. I am usually a miser in ratings and 8 is somewhat to the level of must watch..!!
The debate was always on how they finished the drama. I didn't find anything bad about the ending even though it could have been better..!

Too long and lot of loose ends
Started very good. I was excited for each episode wondering what did happen in the beginning of the story but...

ML had a friend that married his ex-wife. Why did she betrayed him? How does that happen and why? Then he marries a stupid woman. Even worse.
His friend seemed a bad person, Stoke the wife, winning to her and... So bad.
Those stories remained unanswered.

The FL was very beautiful and nice. But the writers thought that she could be useless and cried a lot.

The villain (was there any?) Is boring. Did all those awful things because of pride? What did his son do except cheating on his friend and tell him that in his face? What a lousy ex wife she was...

The ending? How can a game restart after correcting only some mistakes. Wasn't Marco one of them?

I don't want coherence in a Syfy story. But I want coherence in the relationships of the characters...

Flashbacks... Don't understand why some dramas are so long and use lots of unnecessary flashbacks. I think the viewers are not Stupid. Well, that may be not true since there are reviews of 1 to 10 stars...

ACTING - good

OST - Flamengo is always nice

PLOT - bad characters development and explanations
Will never REWATCH IT.

Fantastic accent by Park Shin-hye! She is great!

The main reason I liked this drama was the plot, unpredictable and captivating, it does not allow you to get distracted not even for a second or you will miss the change of setting and time.
The production is incredible, honestly one of the best I've ever seen. The choice of places, the direction of photography and cinematography was extremely high-quality, the music is perfectly matched with the setting, and whenever I listen to ""Recuerdos de la Alhambra"" on my own I shiver remembering the scenes in which this song was used, I remember the feelings, the characters, the landscapes and the infamous train scene and the sudden rain.
The actors were amazing, I loved the romance between the two main leads, even though it was a little predictable (maybe the only predictable detail about the plot).
Not gonna spoil the end, but it made me cry. I still think about it nowadays (I finished it in February), and it still makes me shed a tear.
Really a great drama overall, one of the best I've ever seen!

I love this K-drama so much that I managed to finish watching all of the episodes in one sitting. The plot is interesting and unique. The cast was amazing. The male lead was a bit of an ass but I could deal with that. The female lead is not a strong character but who said that every drama needed one. The soundtrack was also great. As an EXO-L, I originally watched this drama for Chanyeol oppa (who plays Sejoo) and the plot but at the end I stayed for the amazing story. Memories of Alhambra is fantasy, sci-fi and romance drama that I would recommend to both gamers and non-gamers.

First of all, I've always wanted to watch this drama but I was so lazy and picky. It looks boring and plain because of the Profile and it's in a different country(bcoz of Heirs xD I wanted them to meet in the US again but it didn't happen..) so, I just keep looking for more other dramas on Netflix but since I am watching Crash Landing On You (RECOMMEND!!), I decided to watch it. TURNING POINT! -that was the best decision ever before 2020 came. I started watching on dec31 in the afternoon and I loved how the beginning is already eye-catching. The action came right away, I got confused at some point but after watching the first episode and two I began to understand it. I like the way they put flashbacks into this drama, it flows so nice and not like a broken slide. The Editing tho, holy 100/100. I'm so amazed at how they create such a story, I wish I can do it too. lol
Trying not to make it long but... overall... This is a good start of 2020 for me even though this drama came in 2018. I'm really impatient on dramas that are not done yet because I get distracted and began to watch diff dramas and I hate that... soo.... and right now... Catch Landing On You is still airing and That drama is SOO GOOD too... sorry, got distracted.
I'm trying my best not to spoil the story, plot twists and etc but if you are into a new genre and a very creative drama. I really recommend this because even in the end, I couldn't think of any possible ending. It's hard. Omy, idk what else to say :( I still cried at the end tho.. UGH! idk!!
There's a lot of twist tho... that's all I can say.
Soooo.... Right now since I just finished watching this drama, I will now watch The Bride Of Habaek!
Still tore and can't get over this drama, BUT YOU GOTTA MOVE ON!!

I got bored after all the dramas that I've watched or started but never finished. While I was scrolling through Netflix to find SOMETHING to watch I bumped into Memories Of The Alhambra but the trailer did not interest me enough so I went past it. After that it happened a few more times. One day I said - okay Netflix, I'll give it a chance since I don't know what to watch either way. I was hooked on since the beginning - but I must admit that first two episodes are a bit slow, although I liked the way it's going to. Then, around episode four, it actually got 1000% of my attention, and my journey in Alhambra has started.

The plot - that's the first thing. AMAZING. I loved the story! I won't tell you what I liked most about it because then I would have to tell you the story, then a few spoilers... No. Trust me. Through out the series we are learning that the virtual reality that someone has created (the person is missing in the series) is not really a virtual reality after all. Main leads - you will see more of a male lead than the female at the beginning, then, with the whole plot development we will see that the woman is important to this story - she is the beginning and the end. Also you might be interested in romance side to this story. I will say that: it's there, along with the characters development. Main leads are building the strong conncetion and then... and then!... but then... oh yeah, there is also a lot of plot twists ;)
That's all you need to know ;)

Moving on to the cast - everyone played their roles very well, they reflected all emotions in a credible way - when they cried I cried. When they felt like everything was good, I felt a nice feeling in my heart too. I'm not here to discuss music or rewatch value - I think that this is personal - because as much as I loved the series I cannot imagine myself sitting on a couch and going through this crazy-good journey again - it has some sad moments, so I could possibly cry again, but louder.
Damn, I actually hope they will make a second season but in the mean time I hope they don't, because they might destroy the story. I know some people are not entirely happy with the ending but it was all I needed. Different from other dramas. You'll have to see this and then decide what you think about possible continuation .

SUMMING UP: PLEASE GUYS - if you're bored or don't know what drama to watch - this one is HELLA GOOD and one of the BEST I've ever watched. You will enjoy it very much! I swear!
Enjoy xoxo

I already saw its trailer but I'm too scared to watch it because for some reason I am not used to seeing a kdrama with a different vibes,I felt like Park Shin Hye is a woman from a Middle East country. Maybe I just watched it because I ran out of a good series to watch,surprisingly this type of story can be finished in just one sitting because the first episode made you already feel excited about what's gonna happen next,and you want your questions to be already answered hehe. Unfortunately I didn't finished it in one sitting but in 2 days :P I like the mix of suspense and I think the sound of the guitar and Mr.Cha will remind me of this drama.

Cast:
This drama also made me watch Secret Garden and My Name is Kim Sam Soon,also Crash Landing On You , (PS: to those who already watched Crash Landing on You can relate about the humor about ""Memories of the Alhambra"" hihi

Chan Yeol really fits the role of Se Ju,he's given only few appearances but his acting is really great!

Professor Cha- Watching him get a taste of his own bad plans is satisfying!

The only thing I don't like about it were the number of flashbacks they've shown before getting direct to the point •

It's not just any show that can keep me interested for the entirety of it, this show did! The plot is original and creative and as a gaming lover I loved the whole concept of the vr game and how they made it look like a game was really being played.

All the actors did a great job especially Hyunbin who carried the show on his shoulders, I already had a crush on him since secret garden and now I admire him even more.

The romance was good, they had good chemistry, and there was just the right amount of it, it wasn't the main focus of the show.

If I'm not mistaken there was only one ost that played during romance scenes and I wished there were more although I did like that one song.

Of course there are aspects that could have been better explained or more detailed like Park Shin Hye's character, or Chanyeol's character, etc, but the show evolved around Jin woo mainly so I understand. The ending could have also been less open ended and more clear but it was good and I personally liked it.

I really liked the plot & story of the show. Everything was mysterious & unexpected. When the show started I could never imagine how it's gonna end. It took 16 eps to understand the game & what was happening from the beginning. Acting was really good especially my 'Captain Ri' from 'CLOY' killed it. His expression & acting felt so real. But I really missed So Ye Jin here. After 'CLOY' I can't stand any other female lead with Hyun bin. Park Hye Shin's acting was fantastic but still the chemistry wasn't good compared to 'CLOY'. Btw, the story was amazing & I loved the plot. So, worth watching.

Okay, first of all, just stop what you are doing, just go sit down and binge the whole thing tonight okay!?! This is one of the best underrated dramas of 2019! I said what I said. Okay first of all I LOVE PARK SHIN HYE AND HYUN BIN! They have super great chemistry! This drama isn't a romance drama but it provides it for sure. This kdrama is SO unique. I can not stress that enough. The writing and production and visuals is EVERYTHING. It's thrilling, full of action and packed with scifi qualities. You will be rooting for Hee Joo and Jin woo for sure. This is a MUST WATCH. Okay? I also forgot to mention that this kdrama gives you ALL THE FEELS, at times you will be scared too (you'll know why later, plus next time it suddenly starts thundering and raining you will freak) Go log off and watch it now.

God I really really wanted to love this drama for so many reasons. Like a lot of others I thought this drama had so much potential and such a great cast! The beginning was great, I loved it. I think I binged the first couple of episodes. But then at some point I lost complete track of the whole point of the story. It started to get messy and repetitive and all around boring. I feel like there was so much SO MUCH potential and so many places that the story could have gone, but it just went nowhere. I finished it out of loyalty but I was real cheesed for the whole second half.

This drama gave me major W vibes. Which isn’t surprising since it’s from the same creator. The concept is so fresh and original. The plot in itself is reason enough to watch the show.

Also laughing over the fact that after ‘Pinocchio’ both Lee Jong Suk and Park Shin Hye moved on to medical dramas and then ‘alternate reality’ shows.

Another thing I find funny is how this drama is more of an action thriller and yet we get better kiss scenes than actual romance dramas lmaooo

But man, what a man Jin-woo is. He risked it all for a man he hadn’t even MET. He lost SO much in the process. I couldn’t believe he was still in one piece after going through all the pain and trauma he suffered. The ghost NPC of his ex-best friend coming to kill him every day?! With other enemy NPCS appearing out of the blue around him constantly, in every shape and form?! What a life to live, jesus.

I both liked and disliked the ‘Momento’ story-telling method. How we’d see one scene and then go back in time to see what happened leading up to it. It did make things interesting, although it was annoying to watch entire scenes we’d already seen all over again. Still, it was different and I liked the originality.

If I did have another complaint, it would be Hee-ju’s role. I wish she had more involvement. She was such an amazing female lead (and honestly deserves better, whoops) and did everything in her power for the man she loved. She was so intelligent and kind, and this is why I wish she had played a bigger role. Apart from being Jin-woo’s shoulder to cry on, I wish she could have joined the game properly and made a difference plot-wise. I wish Jin-woo could have fought with Hee-ju by his side. Or for her to also have some ‘hacking’ skills and help from the sidelines. Just something that helped him apart from emotionally. That’s just my two cents, I feel like it was a wasted opportunity.

I was going to write I was somewhat okay with the ending, but after seeing other people’s reactions and realising what we could have had, it does make me disappointed. Jin woo really did deserve a happy ending (shown on screen) after all the suffering and pain he went through. And jin woo and se ju should have met. Jin woo spent the whole show trying to save him, they deserved to meet.

Other than that, I did enjoy the suspense and originality of the drama. You honestly never know what’s coming next, it’s always up in the air. But the writing is good and it does make for a good watch

The only thing good about this drama was the cast and amazing acting by the leads. The plot was very different from the usual Korean Dramas, but I think because of keeping it too different, the writers ruined the story. There were so many plot holes and the so many unanswered questions pissed me off. I would recommend this drama, but it's like a one-time thing. Wouldn't rewatch it. I think I expected something different from it as the budget was huge for this drama and the production was epic, but the story (especially in the end) was just too rushed and confusing.

Had started watching because of its director. Had loved his work on stranger.
The drama had a good start and I believe engaging till the 12th episode, though the pace slows and the story seems to go about in round about manner. The plot is confusing after that and logic and intelligence goes in the background. I would have put up with it if they had somehow made a happy ending. But an open ending and the last episode was the most disappointing. Whilst they may have good rating, people will be cautious before watching another drama by the writer / director

I think it's a perfect drama. I don't know why people don't like the ending. I was so bored by same category endings in kdrama. It was unique. I'm a fan of Hyun Bin. But by this drama I've became a big fan Of Park Shin Hye. She is a great actress. Her acting is so pure. She is really Pretty, cute. Her crying scenes are so real. I could feel it. Hyun Bin is so good. I'm now interested in games. The chemistry was perfect. It's a sci-fi drama. So you can't expect so many lovey dovey scenes. Everything was perfect for me. Best drama.

If you have watched W and liked it, then this should be on your watch list. If you haven't watched W but if you're into gaming, then you should watch this drama. If you are neither a gamer nor watched W, even then this should be on your watch list. If you are a gamer and have watched W, then this drama should be on your priority watch list.

The story revolves around an AR game, it's developer and the people who are ready to buy this game. From start to finish, the story makes you glued to the screen - it was like that for me. But bugs appear on this game, people get killed and those who end up playing it at times experiences that there is only a thin line between reality and the game. Can the developer delete the bugs? Watch the drama to find out.

Park Shin hye who gave life to Emma and Hee ju was exceptional as always. Se ju played by Chanyeol - all Exols should watch this. Honestly I wasn't sure of Chanyeol justifying Seju's role but the last two episodes proved me wrong. Chanyeol did his part well. Hyun bin - we all know he is a veteran actor and can handle any role with ease. Others worth mentioning are those who played Marco, CEO Cha, Jin woo's Secretary, Su jin, CEO Park, Professor Cha, Hee Ju's sister and Go Yu Ra.

Music is excellent and suits the drama very well.

The Changes I would have made to this drama if I was in charge - I wanted Seju to have more screen time not because it is Chanyeol, but the Character himself as the game developer - deserved more screen time. Second thing is I might have wanted the ending differently but the ending of this drama is different to the one I or many of us might have imagined(in a good way) . There's a scope for season II, no there has to be a season II otherwise it is like they left us hanging midway just like that.

I will patiently wait for season II no matter how long it takes.

Most Disappointing Ending

I was immediately pulled into Memories of Alhambra. It was interesting from the start and I was invested in the characters, but the ending did not live up to the build-up. There seemed to be a plot hole that didn’t make sense to me and I felt it left off on a cliffhanger that leaves the viewer confused and annoyed.

What I Liked About It

The suspense was the best part of the drama. It was exciting to see Jin-woo level up in the game as he fights to put the pieces together. There was never a time where I was bored. In fact, I was binge-watching the show for a few days at the start.

The music helped amplify the suspense. It wasn’t beautiful music or anything, but I felt it served its purpose of pulling us into the turmoil Jin-woo was faced with every episode. The acting was also very well done from all of the characters, which helped to make it more believable though the premise was impossible.

I really liked Hee-joo’s younger sister, Min-joo. She was excitable, respectful, and she was the reason I sort of believed in the relationship between Hee-joo and Jin-woo. They felt mostly incompatible to me but whenever Min-joo started trying to get them together I was instantly invested again. I thought she brought some humor and relief to the characters after the constant strife they dealt with throughout the entire show. I also liked Hee-joo herself because she was relatable. She worked tirelessly to keep her family afloat without much help and was there for Jin-woo even though he sometimes didn’t deserve it.

I loved that they were in Spain and I could practice listening for both my Spanish and Korean learning skills. There was also some English used as well. I liked the diversity in location; the scenery in Granada was quite beautiful and made me want to take a trip there; I never knew this place existed until this show, so I learned something new.


What I Didn’t Like About It

I didn’t like Jin-woo’s character. He was selfish, secretive, and mostly used Hee-joo in the beginning. He did warn her that he wasn’t a good person, so at least he wasn’t painted as the great grand hero. I feel his character did change throughout the show. In the beginning he was just interested in using people for his own gain, but after constantly having to question his own sanity, his driving force was no longer money. For someone who started off selfish, his character did grow to care for others later. Still, I never really liked his personality and felt that he was always kind of stringing Hee-joo along. After he had his secretary pretend to be her brother sending emails for an entire year, I doubt I would want to date him after that. Hee-joo seemed to forgive him quickly since he was working hard to find her brother, but I would’ve never trusted him again.

I hated the ending. I literally leapt at the screen with bulging eyes saying, “What? That’s it??” How is that it? They completely neglected to explain how in the world this game was able to make fake game guns shoot real bullets and kill people who miraculously became bugs in the system. They didn’t explain how Hee-joo’s brother, Se-joo, was able to create a space in the game for him to disappear into, a space that only exists in the game in order to hide from the real world. Obviously, it’s supernatural, but I was hoping for some sort of explanation as to how in the world he could create such an elaborate game that exists outside time.

Is he a god? Does he have special powers? My initial thought was that there was a hallucinogenic in the game contacts making people hallucinate, but that doesn’t account for why people were actually dying from weapons that weren’t real, so…Whoop-dee-doo I guess we’ll never know, but that makes this one of the most annoying endings I’ve ever seen in a TV show. The writers just didn’t create the entire basis for the story and simply didn’t finish telling it. It feels like there should definitely be a second season to explain the entire first season, but I don’t know if that’s likely; it’s been 3 years already.

Another thing that annoyed me was the huge plot-hole. In the end, it appears that the bugs were all the people who were killed in the game, but the first person to be killed was Se-joo’s backstabbing friend yet when Jin-woo got rid of the bugs the first one was said to be Hyung-seok. Yes, he was the first to die by Jin-woo’s hand in the game, but he wasn’t the first to die in the game period. That was Se-joo’s friend, whom Se-joo killed by mistake because he didn’t know the game’s guns could actually kill people. So, why did the writers act like Hyung-seok was the first to die?? Did I miss something? There’s no way Se-joo’s friend could be gotten rid of because Jin-woo hadn’t yet given Emma the key at the time of his death. So…huge plot hole that was pretty glaring if I’m remembering correctly.


Is It Worth a Rewatch?

At the end of the day, I would rewatch certain scenes, such as the ones shot in the beautiful Granada. I would watch for the actors’ performances and if I want to see something suspenseful. I would not rewatch it from the beginning because I know how disappointing the ending is. They create all these chasing scenes with all this loud, suspenseful music just to lead up to a deflated balloon-type ending. So disappointing.

A very well built cast and an amazing direction with a lack of good writing.
I started this drama with very few expectations. To be honest, with expectations that it was gonna be a lost of time. I have never been a lover of Park Shin Hye, I find her adorable and beautiful but when talking about acting she has always sending me varied experiences, and almost never good ones.
Buttttttt I started it and it really surprised me, in a good way.

Let's start talking about *acting*, I can not say anything bad about the actors, I'm not ""bias"" for Hyun Bin, but I've always praised his great performance despite some bad scripts and characters; this time, Hyun Bin presents a character with a deep emotional pain, with behaviors of anxiety disorder, the best of this is that we see how the character Yoo Jin-Woo goes from being mentally balanced to an alcoholic with problems to face the reality, a person who has to deal with post-traumatic stress day after day. Although not everything is perfect in this point, because it lacked depth on the part of the writers who easily forgot the problems that the protagonist had shown two episodes ago. Park Shin Hye, showed me a facet of good performances (and good Spanish! What a shock! so great!) A great repertoire of expressions and new ways of relating to their co-stars, was something beautiful, although not perfect as lacked a bit of depth to her character. The other supporting actors were between ""fantastic, I love you"" and ""I do not know what you're doing here and I don't care"" the latter is mainly directed to both ex-wives, I dont know what happened there, it was a horror to see their scenes without any meaning but to stole time, it was fatal; although it is also divided the fault with the writing of characters so vague and without depth.

Let's continue talking about the quality of production, I do not know how much Netflix had to do in the production, but I could see within the first 30 minutes of the first episode that it was going to be fantastic. The interactions between the real and the virtual world were impressive, the changes were made as if by magic (the magic of technology). And, most importantly, you could still distinguish the real from the virtual reality, or at least the first chapters, because we, the spectators, also get involved in the same way that the main character Yoo Jin-Woo, without knowing everything transforms and we can not distinguish if what is shown on the screen is reality. I can not but express how great the direction and production is, it is a real delight to see it on the screen.
*Here is the problem*
Writing was what I liked the least, it started very strong, every week I wanted more and more, but after a while the problem lengthened, forgetting the problems raised before for the characters, the non-main characters were vague and without depth, I could not care less what happened to them. There was never a Villain with a capital V, which could be good if it highlighted the demon that had the protagonist inside him, his own battle with himself, but it was not achieved. Here is the weak link of the whole drama, a tremendous pity because it started with great potential that was lost over time.
For all the above, I can say that it is a drama that is worth seeing, it entertains you and it is beautiful when you see it, with great performances and a tremendous direction. While it has its weak points, they are not so tragic when viewed in a casual way. For these reasons I give it an 8 and I am left with my thought, that I already had some time ago, that Hyun Bin is a tremendous actor.

This show had everything to be top-rated but fell flat for me in attachment. The drama had a very interesting plot line which reminded of SAO Ordinal Scale. It was shot beautifully with a grayish scale tone being always present. Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye did a fantastic job in their roles with Hyun Bin obviously being the star of the show as the one man army against all odds. The romance was present, but it wasn't one that made me excited or happy, even though there was good chemistry. I was relieved the Park Shin Hye was finally able to kiss properly against her last drama. The show portrayed how even just one person's faith can mean the world to you and be a pillar of strength to keep moving on. There were plot holes as you neared the end, and the ending itself was very bittersweet and open-ended. The OST was seriously outstanding though like it came out of a freakin Skyrim game.

I put of this show for a long time and I finally watched it. I have to say the show was quite good, other than the fact that the story kept going back to show what happened to get to a certain point. I'd recommend to watch it though it hope Netflix will make a season 2 of this show. I highly doubt they will, but man the ending being just that, it gave us hope, but I feel so unsatisfied, maybe it's just because he was all blacked out being shown helping characters, but I need more man, it felt left unfinished and I dearly hope for an continuation. This show has so much potential and I know they could some hoe continue it. I mean it is a happy ending in the way of knowing he is alive, but I just want more.

I think the highlight of this drama is the unpredictable and well written storyline. Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin played their respective roles very well. I just din't gave this drama a perfect score because it lack more romance until the end. I am expecting more romance with this drama. I also did not like the many flashbacks with every episodes. Overall I enjoyed this drama and I would recommend it to many K Drama Fans because of its unique story, Great acting by the lead actors and the beautiful scenery of Granada, Spain.

This series is lacking because of scenes that doesn't need to be prolonged. The acting was great but the story is somewhat filled with holes, i thought they were very clever in the beginning but in the end I see it as a low grade series. Damn, the scenery and all are very great but the story, filled with holes. I was very upset because of my expectations for this series. I should've watched this series first before Crash Landing on You. Very bad mistake. If I am being honest here, i would've spewed many crap about the story, and the rewatch value would be 0. That's all. I was very disappointed on how some characters act or how some parts of the story were done.

This show had so much potential to be a one of a kind show, and could have easily been one of my favorite shows, but unfortunately it failed to.
First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest respect to the writer behind this show Song Jae Jung, the same mind behind creating other very famous and iconic fantasy/sci-fi genre dramas including Queen In-Hyun’s Man, Nine: Nine times time travel, and W Two worlds. And while these shows might not have necessarily been perfectly written from start to finish, but we have to admit that their plots were highly original and innovative, proving above anything the rich imagination skills of the mind behind creating them. So kudos to her, for surprising her viewers every time.

So focusing on Memories of Alhambra, what I liked and what I did not so much.

First the story:
As I mentioned earlier, the story in this one is one of great originality and creativity, an smartly written plot packed with fantasy, thriller, mystery, action and drama. It is a story that constantly keeps its viewer at the edge of their seats (where it particularly excelled), and resembles the writer’s previous fantasy works in that it compels the viewer to keep questioning and guessing and re-guessing the rules of the world created inside of it (where it might not have necessarily been up to par).
The plot revolves around an AR (Augmented Reality) Game, and the chaos and struggles that arise when the barrier between the game and reality start to crumble, and how the real lives of the players become detrimentally affected by the game, causing major casualties along the way.
First if you are to venture into this drama, you have to abandon your scientific reasoning, and do not expect realism. If you manage to go past the “HOW”s and such, you will find yourself in front of an entertaining ride, featuring beautiful cinematography, and high-end CGI.
Being a fantasy drama though unexpectedly requires stating rules. You might be creating an imaginary world that defies real world and common sense, but you still have to a certain extent assign rules guiding this imaginary realm, to explain why and how things happen the way they do.
At first, both the viewer and the main characters are struggling to grasp such rules, later on we start to guess and put theories, with the writing providing hints. The problem though is that this drama eventually did not manage to create a neat and consistent reasoning all the way through, instead the viewer will find himself at a certain point compelled to abandon his struggles to understand why things happen and more importantly why they only happen at certain instances but other times fail to, and instead settle on just enjoying the exquisite scenery, high-end CGI and kick-ass action.
The only part of the story that I found lacking even more than such plot-holes or inconsistencies, was unfortunately none other than the romance. I am a fan of romantic genre, and easily swoon, get butterflies and find chemistry between many an OTP, so when I watch a drama and find myself near the end wondering why these two fell in love in the first place, that’s when I know that the romance somehow lost me. That was the case here, not on both sides of the equation though, because while the pace of development of HIS feelings towards her were very believable and natural of a man of his past and position, HER feelings always felt kind of rushed and too sudden. I do not mind love at first sight scenarios, or being attracted visually to someone, but that somehow did not feel like it was the case here either.
All in all, the romance for me felt a bit lacking on a relatability-wise, but I noticed that other people enjoyed it just fine. So it might be tastes and nothing more.


Acting:
Solid performances from everyone, especially Hyun Bin, who you can say was the sole star of this show. It is after all, his story proved by his narration.
As for Park Shin Hye, .I am not a fan of her to be honest, so at the beginning not enjoying her character I thought was because of that. But the more the story progressed and the more her character’s involvement in the story increased (though never amounting to much significance) the more I realized, that it was not the actress’ problem, but rather the writing of the character itself. She is supposed to be a very hand-working, independent and multi-talented lady, and I appreciated how they shed light on her upbringing and past via a neat flashback sequence, but somehow she never felt truly human, but rather a shallow human being with no life of her own. The show certainly succeeded in showing how she was devoting herself wholeheartedly to the well-being of her family, sometimes sacrificing her own ambitions and dreams in return, but somehow it still failed to nail to draw out who she is as a person. Maybe also my feelings towards the romance in this drama in general might have helped to make me feel more detached from the female lead, maybe just that I didn’t fancy Park Shin Hye’s mouth-slightly-opened emotional portrayal, dunno. (I apologize to any PSH fans out there :D)

All in all, this was definitely an enjoyable drama, with a smart and original plot, great cinematography, solid performance, and nicely paced. And like all this writer’s other dramas, while having its issues, it is by all means a drama worth watching, pondering, and enjoying. I would particularly recommend it to fantasy genre fans, game fans and of course Hyun Bin fans because he definitely excelled here.

The writer of this drama had a good approach to keep the audience to wait for next episode. I usually not to keen for this type of genre, but i can finished this drama. For first part, i keep want to know what will be happen in the next episode but after ep 10, i think the story keep used repetitive story and i feel just want to finish its quickly. I not sure whether its just that find, this drama does not need the lovelive at all. Hyunbin just can solve the mystery about the games without involved in loveline. The loveline distract me form the story. At first, i'm curious about the lovelive but after episode 4 the loveline is unnesessary for this type of drama. it feel forced.Overall this drama is okay and hope writer be nice to male lead, how came he did not got a clear ending. Male lead is the most suffered character in this drama and he need a better ending.

Every gamers fantasy
Memories of Alhambra is fantasy of every game lover . I loved how every tiny detail was soo perfectly embodied in the story.If you love playing videos games you gonna love this one.I loved the show bcz it has soo unique story. Mostly K-dramas that I watched had somewhat stories that we already had seen somewhere but this was totally unique and I am surprised why memories of Alhambra isn’t hyped the way it should be.Story is soo powerful,visuals are soo good.Also full of thrill and suspense. Whatever you think is going to happen the opposite happens. Perfect combo of science fiction plus romance. I honestly wasn’t expecting tht this show will be soo amazing.Plus the theme song Little Prince is love ?

Really good show
This drama was really good! It had a pretty unique idea, Virtual Games in Real Life but with a deep story that no drama has ever made before(I think) The story is 10/10,no debate. Honestly, the first 2 episodes were the best in the series. You'll know why when you finish it. The acting was top notch, same with the music. My only problem was the pacing, for some time, the pacing was very bad so I got bored easily. That's why I don't think I'd re-watch it. Other than that, it's pretty good and it's a solid 8/10!

Great Script, Great Performances
I am not a gamer in any way, so when I saw the premise for this I thought it might not suit me. I was completely wrong.

This was only my second kdrama, but I still consider it to be one of the most creative scripts I've seen produced. I don't know how people who are immersed in the world of gaming would react to it, but I was fascinated. Fortunately, from my perspective, the writer didn't overload the drama with technical jargon, and it was simple to follow along.

I have since seen a great deal of Hyun Bin's performances, and I still consider this one of his best; the subtle changes in his physicality were masterful, and it was great to see him in an action role with some depth. I think that most actors develop a few tricks that they can come to rely on when performing (whether or not they are aware), and I was grateful to see a performance practically devoid of gimmicks. I also appreciated the maturity that he brought to the role.

Park Shin Hye was beautiful in this drama, and her performance was adequate, though I didn't get a real sense of urgency or chemistry from her. I will admit that I rarely feel any sense of chemistry from her performances, though.

I absolutely loved Park Hoon's performance as Yoo Jin Woo's former business partner - whenever he was on screen, my attention was immediately fixed on him (not just due to the character). Great job with a small, repetitive role.

Another great example of the old adage, ""there are no small roles, only small actors"" was the performance given by Lee Jae Wook. Intense, realistic, dynamic.

I highly recommend this drama, even to people like myself, who aren't into gaming and action films.

It's a perfect drama, especially those who loves gaming/e-sports and action.Even though the leads have age difference they have a special bonding. It's a drama that we shouldn't be missed out. I wanted a happy ending like the leads reunites. Even though they haven't the drama promising ML is alive that he can comeback once the quest completed.

Fast Paced , Action packed, compelling story
8,5/10 is my rating. This is a 2018/2019 South Korean television series, with 16, 60 minute episodes. Takes place in Spain and South Korea.

Yoo Jin-woo (Hyun Bin) is a well known handsome and successful CEO of an investment company he co-founded with college friends. He is in the process of divorcing his second wife who has caused nothing but trouble for him during their short marriage. He receives an email about a virtual reality game that is poised to change gaming future. Jin-woo travels to Spain to meet Jung Se-joo (Park Chan-yeol) who created the game in the hopes of beating his rival to buy rights to the game. Upon arrival, Jin-woo finds out Se-joo is missing. Since Se-joo is missing he learns he must buy the rights from Se-Jon’s older sister, Jung Hee-joo (Park Shin-hye). There is a problem as Jin-woo is staying in Hee-Joo’s run down hostel and held back nothing in telling her what he thought of the state of the hostel and her personally. He has to swallow his pride and convince Hee-joo. All the while he is testing the game and is learning there may be some very dangerous flaws that are deadly. He also thinks the flaws may be behind Se-Jon’s disappearance. People who die in the game wind up dead in reality and then show up in the game as murderous assassins. Jin-woo discovers this and tries to tell his counterparts at the company but they label him crazy. Jin-woo begins to play the game near obsessively to level up thinking if he can master the game he will be able to prove and expose the flaws and find the young game creator. Hee-joo feels thankful to Jin-woo as the money he paid pulls her family out of poverty. Soon gratitude becomes something more and the two develop feelings for each other.

Spoiler ? This movie really had it all a compelling mystery, great cast, complex character development, an interesting storyline and believable romance. It had a lot of action and was fast paced. There were sad points and not all my favorite characters made it. I loved Hee-Joo’s younger sister, her conversations with Jin-woo were cheeky and entertaining. However, the ending left things up in the air. It strongly seems they left it open for another season. It also made it a bit sad. I would have preferred they wrap the season up and thread some elements into a subsequent season or create another stand alone that has the same central. I really liked and enjoyed this but the ending spoiled it. Still worth watching but it helps I think to know it has a very nebulous ending.

How To Get Yourself Hooked ?
Augmented reality, scenic Spanish streets, swashbuckling action, slow-burn romance, a dimpled Byronic hero, Memories of the Alhambra has it all. Memories of the Alhambra is a genre-bending, sixteen-episode K-drama series currently streaming on Netflix.Like many K-dramas before it, Memories of the Alhambra has an epic cast and a storyline that twists and turns and flashes forward and backward. There are cliffhangers aplenty in this series of over sixteen hours.

At its heart though is a romance. The slow-burning, possibly doomed romance between the arrogant, high-flying tech innovator Yoo Jin-woo (Hyun Bin) and the demure and dutiful hostel owner and guitar maker Jung Hee-joo (Park Shin-hye). Jin-woo ends up at Hee-joo’s hostel in Granada, Spain. And how and why this rich tech world star ends up in her rundown hostel and the aftereffects of that stay is the story in a nutshell.

This is the Computer Game that Will Never End
Jin-woo gets a mysterious call in the middle of the night at his Barcelona hotel room, a call summoning him to come to the Bonita Hostel in Granada. The call is from a young man, looking to sell an extraordinary computer game he has been developing.

When Jin-woo’s competitor is named as a possible buyer, Jin-woo’s interest is immediately piqued. He heads to Granada. But the young man never shows up.Unbeknownst to hostel owner and responsible big sis, Hee-joo, it’s her little brother who is this programming genius. He has created an augmented reality computer game, where instead of sitting behind screens, players are out in the real world, utilizing Jin-woo’s innovative contact lenses to play in the streets and shops and squares of Granada.

The game brings to life medieval Granada, especially its warriors. Yeah, think Pokémon Go hotspots, but instead of cute little creatures to catch, players must fight assassins and soldiers and warriors and pirates and the like. For any role-playing game aficionados out there, this game is an RPG in real life, where players walk around, find weapons, gain experience points, earn money, fight and fight some more to move up the levels.

After trying this augmented reality game himself (and getting more than a few strange looks, as he battles enemies that no one else can see), Jin-woo is sold. It has huge moneymaking potential. But his nemesis is also on the scent of this game, has also received log-in information. And still, the creator is AWOL. The more Jin-woo plays, the more it starts to become apparent that this augmented play realm has real-life repercussions. Some rather serious and final.

Yeah, I don’t want to give it all away. But there’s a glitch in the game that starts making this augmented reality way too real. Think Tron here. Even with his lenses out and not logged in, Jin-woo becomes a permanent player, always playing, even far from the streets of Granada. So, how does he get out, stop the game, fix this glitch, and maybe find that missing creator? See Memories of the Alhambra to find out.

Wait, Where’s the Romance?!
Yes, the above description sounds like a fast-paced action thriller. And, indeed, in many ways Memories of the Alhambra is an action thriller. There are fight scenes aplenty (with a good amount of blood) and tons of RPG-screen shots of stats – vitality, hit points, experience, abilities, etc. Yeah, it’s pretty much like watching your son play an electronic RPG-game. And the CGI here is first rate.But what takes this show out of pure action thriller is the amount of time given to the development of relationships. The story is continually built upon non-linearly, meaning that in every episode there are windows into the past and the future.

These windows add more and more layers to this tale. Layers which explain where characters have been and where they’re going, giving us insight into why they act as they do. It’s an incredibly engaging story-building form. And what we learn is that there is much more to Jin-woo than a pretty face, two failed marriages, an enormous bank account with an ego to match. He ends up in Mr. Rochester territory for me – and I don’t say that lightly, diehard Rochester fan that I am.

The smarmy charms and sarcastic snipes begin to fall away. There’s a nobility there, a stoic suffering, an idealist, a man willing to take the hit, to lay down his very life to protect those dear to him. It is his mission to find the missing creator, Hee-joo’s little brother, knowing that it may very well cost him his life. And he does this because he loves her, Hee-joo, although he never says it. She is the pure, idealistic, feisty Jane to his Rochester.

Hee-joo sees him, the goodness in him, and as much as he warns her to keep her distance, she’s there – often crying or yelling at him or both (-: And as much as he tries to distance himself from her to protect her from himself and this never-ending dangerous game, he has trouble completely keeping her at arm’s length. Oh, it’s good stuff. Facades fall. Characters grow and reflect. And a romance flickers so tantalizingly between our two leads.

A Worth Watch
I watched Memories of the Alhambra with my tween son (the series is rated TV-MA for fight scenes). Mom’s getting her Rochester and Jane romance while son is getting a good sci-fi dose of augmented reality gaming. (Okay, I admit it, I also have a thing for butt-kicking action.) It’s a marriage made in heaven. It works and works well.Sometimes the K-drama propensity for long, slow-mo shots got me giggling. Hee-joo’s shocked big eyes got a bit infuriating at times. But it got better a few episodes in, and I know this is something of a K-drama trope.

For the most part, though, Memories of the Alhambra is a gripping, romantic, quest tale.The two leads have great chemistry. Hyun Bin as Jin-woo is the linchpin in this production, and he knocks it out of the park. He is fantastic in this role, playing the jerk, the charmer, the action star, the haunted stoic. In short, the Byronic hero – with dimples! (I have a thing for dimples – married a pair myself, which my son inherited). Oh, he shines here in this role.

Overall Thoughts
In short, Memories of the Alhambra has a broad appeal. The production is high quality, and the cinematography is lovely. The acting is great, and the story is innovative. You’ll laugh, cringe, roll your eyes, question, wonder, sigh, swoon, cry, gasp, worry. You should be able to convince the male(s) in your life to see it with you without too much arm twisting.

And yeah, it doesn’t always make sense – technically – like how the heck are they trapped in a game?! And yeah, there’re many none too subtle product placements. But then Jin-woo smiles with those dimples, and I forgive and forget (-:

Alternate Ending or a Season 2 Please!
Hyun Bin playing Yoo Jin Woo was off the chain. Another KDrama that had me focused. I did not skip any episodes to get to the ending but I wished I did. Park Shin Hye playing Jung Hee Joo/Emma was also off the chain. She had my tears with emotions running all throughout this KDrama. Her acting abilities to play someone who Loves deeply was phenomenal. Not to say Hyun Bin didn't because he surely did.

I really like the storyline. You know I believe that these sort of games will be a virtual reality in the near future. The only problem I have with the storyline is the ending. I feel that the character Yoo Jin Woo after he did what he did in the church by the deletes should have escaped and ended the game to come back in the real world to be with Hee Joo. NOT unless there will be a 2nd Season. That was a cliffhanger if I ever saw one. So, I googled, my question and here is what I found:

""Memories of the Alhambra is a Korean drama on Netflix that recently ended (just yesterday), with a huge uproar towards its ending. ... Here's a recap on episode 16 of Memories of the Alhambra, i.e. the last episode for this drama. There are obviously spoilers if you haven't watched it yet. (written Jan 21, 2019). There is also a petition that fans are asking Netflix for second season of Hyun Bin, Park Shin-Hye drama. ' I SURELY HOPE SO AND WILL SIGN!

Refreshing story, intriguing, exciting, thrilling and unpredictable plot with a LAME ending.
As much as I loved this show and how unpredictable and crazy the game was, as much as I detested the writer’s failure in terms of Characters in the last 3 episodes.
Si Jo, the creator of the game, returning from his dungeon and being utterly useless, tongue-tied and frightened like a kitten the whole time without answering any questions, surprisingly enough Hee Jo never felt that her brother is responsible for the dreadful events following the introduction of this game, and the death of the most beloved character “City Hunter”
If a person I love or from my family was involved in creating a dangerous thing, I would feel guilty and apologetic to others while trying not to blame him while he is down and low. I found this to be quite strange and utterly unacceptable, especially that they all treated him like the victim even though Jin Woo suffered all the losses and negative outcomes of this game. Se Joo didn’t even propose the possibility of Jin Woo hiding till the last 20 minutes of the show, this is ridiculous, I think he is the WORST character in the show. He offered no explanations, he had no clue what was going on, he didn’t shed a light on the creation of the game or how he met Marco, most importantly doesn’t seem like he understands where the awful glitch started. Also, if it’s meant to be a 'game, how come he was sure Jin Woo is dead because Emma deleted him? Isn’t this a game? And why did he become a virus in the first place!
Secretary Seo is the real star of this show, he had a fun, endearing personality and portrayed being NCP in a haunting, heart-breaking manner, I can’t forget the blank expression on his face every time he appears an ally.
The soundtrack is ALL lame, a part of “Memories of Alhambra “piece played by Emma and when Dr. Cha appears with thunder and rain, other than that the music failed the show.
Episode 15 was pointless, Episode 16 was trying to touch down on reality and I think it did quite well until the annoying Park Shin Hye went running to find Jin Woo where he was claimed to be. However, one question was always ringing in my head: Why does she always jump into a cab when she has her own car?

Upon watching this it felt eerily familiar to w, because its the same writer, i think director and music is by the same people too but i could be wrong, its like watching w, its suspenseful until the end

Spoiler alert : avoid reading from this point on if u havent watched


there are plot holes like why wasnt marcos bug taken care of, how the game still plays without the lens, why didnt they just shut the game and closed all servers instead, how he was able to run a marathon when he was limping since early episodes


Spoilers end: dont read the paragraph above if u havent watched

Music was great, keeps you pumped
Story was interesting enough to keep you going
Hyun bin is the reason to watch this, he acts good
Too bad only early episodes was funny, it got more serious as it went on
Rewatch value is alright

Overall i enjoyed the ride it was fun and i wanted more but knew the story had to end there

plot is good but the only female protagonist is basically useless, great
-hey, how about we create an amazing plot with a little bit of romance to spice it up? -Yes, but let's not show how they start liking each other and also, give she girl as little participation on the story as possible.
That's how I imagine them writing this part of the script. Okay so, honestly I loved the story, it was so creative and well structured, it really got me hooked. The idea and the adventure/action part was really well done, you can clearly see the it was one of their priorities. BUT the only thing that bothered me like crazy was Jung Hee Joo / Emma's role in the drama, I mean she is literally on the poster o f the series but her charecter was completly useless. I couldn't ignore the way the only woman on the main cast was portrayed, Park Shin Hye is amazing actress and neither the scrip or the director did any justice. I felt that she was only there to make the hero look stronger and so that he could make a ""sacrifice"" to look like an even better person.
About their ""romance"", it was poorly written and awfully structured, it was so rushed like one moment they hate eachother and the next they are kissing. It didn't make any sense and it was totally useless to the plot, just because it's a man and a woman doesn't mean they have to kiss at some point (heteronormativity still going strong right). Also, Hee Joo had no personality or charecter development, it's like they just shoved her in the story and forgot that she was her until hey need a kiss scene. Jung Hee Joo is supposed to look all determined and and hardworking, but barelly has any involviment in the story and when she appears, she is always being saved by him. Women don't need to be saved, female protagonists are just as strong as the male protagonists.

Recommending
I highly recommend this drama! Month after you finish the last episode you will probably consider watching it for a second time.

PLOT:
Interesting story with good balance between dynamic, informational and drama moments. In this drama we see character development, inner persona dilemma and interesting life choices.

MUSIC:
The OST is really good. After the 3rd episode you will be huming the main track.

ACTING:
Hyun Bin - Hyun Bin did really amazing job! There is one scene that totally below my mind. By my opinion he did 90% of the drama.
Park Shin Hye - I really hoped that she will change my bad opinion of her, but it didn't work. Really weak cry and emotional scenes but she did good with the fear scenes.

SPECIAL EFFECTS AND ECTION:
Really good job, not the best but 8 from 10

cool
omg it was soo cool, the whole concept was intriguing. every action scenes were thrilling and I was looking forward to the next episode, curious on what will happen and wanting to know how the story unfold. it was unique, the storyline. I literally was in awe-struck even though I'm not a gamers I loveee it. the first 12 episodes I don't want to miss anything, I feel like I'm going to miss something. but towards the end, it was getting so slow, the business part thingy was meh and I wish there were more twists and thrill at the last few episode. for the romance, it was kinda unnecessary but I do like them anyways. acting was superb and cg was great.

Less Magical, More Gritty
As my title stated, this show is kind of not what I expected. Netflix made this show seem like a magical love story set in the lovely city of Grenada, Spain. I got to say, not really the case. This was sci-fi, a thriller, and a thriller that was surprisingly gritty and dark. I have mixed feelings on this show. Let me first say that I do not regret watching this show, was it was a good show, and it definitely gets an A+ when it comes to originality. This show blends augmented reality with reality, and the rules are very blurred. That is not to say that there are plot holes, but some one the phenomena make you wonder how that happened (because like logic), and you overlook the first few, but there ends up being a lot. I managed to overlook them, as it was just a small distraction anyway. Visually speaking, this show was great. The graphics of the game along with the lovely city of Grenada has to be mentioned, and does make the show more interesting to watch. This show was also not boring, there was lots of action and plot twists, especially in the beginning. Besides some questionable logic, my main critiques are that the love plotline did not work and lots of the show was kind of...depressing. This was surprisingly gritty and dark as I have mentioned, and lots of this show is watching the protagonist slowly hit rock bottom. Not necessarily a bad thing, just not expected. The overall ending and final episodes had some great moments that were fun to watch and gripping, but the final scene did not make sense to me, but I just went with it.
I know I had a lot of critiques, and this show has its imperfections, but the overall concept, visuals, and plotline were good. I did mostly enjoy watching this, and I am happy that I did watch it, so no regrets here.

Best drama I ever watched!
I found this show by accident. I love romance as a main plot but this drama was so awesome even if a love plot was mostly as a secend one. I was happy and I cried- all in one haha. Actors were great, they did so damn good job. I love mixing cultures and languages. There were a lats of plot twists. The best this is that - you have to think too. This show is like one big box of puzzles, slowly slowly everything starts to fall into it right place. I would love to watch this show again and again for the first time. Totally recommend it!!!!

This one's a mindblower! I was hooked from the beginning to the end! Romance element is weak imho, but the overall story and presentation MORE than makes up for it. Bit of gore and a fair bit of gun violence, but you're not going to be seeing body parts hanging off or anything extreme like that, no worse than i've seen in Joseon dramas.

If you're familiar with Augmented Reality mobile games like Ingress or Pokemon Go then some basic elements of this are going to be familiar, the idea of playing a game out in the real world, where real world locations are important - you need to go to real world locations and complete tasks to play. Alhambra takes this several steps further - merge those ideas with Call of Duty and other current video games and you start to see where things could end up.

If you watch this with a tech mind you're going to start wondering how sword fighting works that causes reaction to your arms, if all you're wearing is contact lenses. There are many other questions you'll ask yourself. Stop. Sit back. Just relax and enjoy the drama, you're thinking too hard. :)

Video FX is outstanding, the way the video game world is layered onto the real world is seamless, just as i'd expect it to be if the game were for real. Simple actions like how the player changes or stores weapons and how things like the armory and so forth are done - perfectly executed. I absolutely and firmly believe that enthusiastic gamers and/or real game designers were involved in the AR game elements because nothing jarred at all (and I say that as a game designer myself).

The story itself is a twisty rollercoaster that goes all over the place, in both Spain and Korea. Nothing is obvious, and the way the story jumps around is at first confusing but once you get the hang of it, it actually makes for an interesting approach. You'll see a sequence of things happen e.g. a,b,c,d, and then later you'll see what actually happened between c and d - or some additional facts will be played out between c and d that totally changes the way you'll understand the meaning of what happens in d. None of this is in a random way either, as the viewer you become guilty of taking a few facts and drawing a conclusion involving additional facts that you made up out of inference or the way something was presented.

Park Shin Hye was great in this, one of my favourite dramas with her in it. After seeing Doctors recently with her where I didn't really buy her performance (or her character) - but this was superb.

Hyun Bin - well this guy just can't put a foot wrong, can he. Exactly the right actor for the job.

The only weakness for something that was just such an epic drama to watch, was the ending. I mean, I get it and I liked where they went (though not how they did it as it feels incomplete), but I can absolutely see why so many people didn't, it's just a tad too subtle imho. There are other reviews which go into detail on explaining it so I won't add to that, but suffice to say if the ending seems ""eh?!"" to you - read them AFTER you watch and all should become clear.

Overall thought this one was brilliant. Rewatch is a tough choice ONLY because I didn't enjoy the ending as much as I was hoping.

PLOT
The plot description of this drama hasn't been done justice on a lot of sites. It's actually a lot more interesting than they make it seem, so here is my version of it:

After getting a strange call about a game that would change the entire world of technology, The co-founder of an investment company, Yoo Jin Woo, travels to Granada, Spain in an attempt to meet the creator and buy the game before his rival and former best friend, Hyeong Seok gets to it.
Forced to stay at a run down guest house, in wait of the creator, Se Ju, Jin Woo plays the new game in an attempt to learn more about it. But as he levels up, things are changing for the worse and Se Ju still hasn't showed up.

REVIEW
The story was well built and stuck to it's logic until the end. I feel like they made this fictional world as realistic as they could while adding a dimension to it as they jump between time lines. Although you might feel like you've seen the same scene many times before, every time it's presented to you, a new clue has been added to it. So this is definitely not a lazy watch. It's a drama that deserves all your attention while watching it.

The theme of the drama is artistic and dark while carefully mixing in the charms of Spain and the lightness of supporting characters. There isn't too much blood being shown apart from the average amount that usually comes out of a body when you stab it, shoot it, or piece it but other than that, they kept it realistic.

There is a love story amongst all the fighting and backstabbing, that didn't steal too much focus from what this drama actually is about. I found the romance to be comfortable, well paced and cute in a way that isn't like a oily, cheesy pizza.

The characters where all memorable in their own way and they all had a reason for existing. The grandmother brings comfort and nostalgia to the audience of Koreans with grandmothers like her, in the nightmare like atmosphere.

The little sister is the embodiment of cupid as the main function of her dialogue is to get the romance going between the two main characters as she also lightens the mood.

The ""adopted"" best friend of the female lead is the logical side of things. He is there to act on the logic that most people would be thinking in the circumstances which balances out with the female lead who completely lives off of fairy dust.

I wish the female lead was less passive and actually had a chance to join in on the dangers of this game. Having a female character fight along side the male lead would have been so refreshing but sadly, she's mostly just crying or fueling the male leads ego while having a pretty bad Spanish accent. She did her best though.

The male lead is quite a cliché character with his hot temper and rude comments, carrying such a hard and cold facade, but the writers did give him a very humane and good side as well so I ended up falling for him at the end anyway.

Of course there are more characters in this drama, that I didn't mention, like:
The old man you would like to strangle with a shoe lace.
The fluffy, cute, innocent, man baby who doesn't get what he deserves.
The famous person who stirs the pot and so on...

So if you like games and the thought of games becoming a reality. Or you're a fan of crime and investigation, you might actually like this drama. Bringing you the feels and many reasons to cry, this might be one of the best dramas this year.

ENJOY!!!

Ignore the plot holes and enjoy the (AR) ride
verall, this was an enjoyable ride but only after I started questioning what was going on. We'll come to that later...
Let's start with the positives: the cinematography, locations, and CGI are all beautiful. The first half of the drama is shot in Alhambra in Spain which looks stunning. Park Shin-Hye's Spanish is also fluent and really helps the integration of her family into their Spanish home.

The CGI is also really well done and well-integrated into the surroundings and with the characters.
You can check out the synopsis elsewhere but there are issues over how the AR tech works (SPOILER ALERT) - like how do they physically feel the effects of the AR weapons; how do they feel pain, how is powered - you know, the logical things.

But... ignore that and it becomes an enjoyable rollercoaster of a who-done-it adventure, and you end up forgiving it a lot of things. The acting is good - if you've only seen Hyun Bin in CLOY then it's weird seeing him be such a jerk at the start but his character develops due to the wonderful Park Shin-Hye and her family. The supporting cast is good too - with the evil Professor Cha (you'll remember him from Mr Sunshine - has he ever played a nice character?) and Hee Ju's little sister who is a great actress. EXO stans will love seeing ChanYeol as Se-Ju as the mysterious creator of the game.

All in all, I like it in spite of the plot holes. Give it a go.

Watched this after being a fan of Hyun Bin in Crash Landing On you.

I fully enjoyed the storyline. Very different and unpredictable. Although the character of Park Shin Hye proved to be the boring one for me. Felt that the story didn't need a love interest at all. It could stand on its own without her character.

Hyun Bin was perfect for the role. I love his deep voice and the way those dimples flash is just.... WOOH!

The game's concept is thoroughly enjoyable. If you are a gamer, this would be the stuff dreams are made of.

A Very Intelligent Story On Virtual Game Competition. What We See On Screen, Can Become REAL!
I seriously started to watch this drama because I love Hyun Bin. Then see if he has chemistry with the sweet and pretty Park Shin-Hye and finally hoping to understand this virtual reality game drama is.

And I must say, the virtual reality game came top on my list from episode 1. It all started for me, the moment I caught on the complexity of the game where real humans can enter duel with them. All this whilst the gaming company is trying to launch faster than the other competitor. The chase for control, the mystery, the chase to duel to the end of the game is thrilling. Special effects, fighting scenes, pretty cool.

Because of this, the romance became secondary to the Virtual Game plot. The relationship between the two main leads left a lot to be desired.

Story: First of all, the plot was quite promising an augmented reality video game and it reminds me of SAO (Sword Art Online) but it gets deeper than that. I am also disappointed that there were only like two, TWO kissing scene from Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye. I want more. The ending was unexpected though and I felt that it was sort of rushed I don't know and what was that? I didn't even know if they met or not!!! I so wanted a season two real bad.
Acting/cast: well, the cast are top-notched but I don't see much chemistry between the two main leads but love their acting nonetheless. Hyun Bin is a good kisser too and Shin Hye has improved her kissing scenes very much. Especially the rain/umbrella scene it was very passionate! it was the best Kiss scene of Shin Hye for me.
Music: Music is quite good and catchy and I have it on my phone to listen to whenever I drive.
Rewatch Value: I don't know. Maybe if they make a season two I will probably rewatch season1 again.
Overall: It was a good watch despite the ending, I just didn't like the ending that's all but overall this is a great drama and a must watch. It's only on Netflix, LOL

10/10 show, until... the ending
I loved every aspect of this drama. From the superb acting of Hyun Bin, to the great setting of Spain. The story was gripping, intriguing, and not predictable at all, the latter being an abundant problem in K-dramas to-date. That is, until the last episode. I've never been this disappointed by an ending. I get that an ending doesn't have to be happy, but this just feels wrong. If the ending were better, this would probably have become my favorite drama of all time, but sadly it isn't.

Watch it if you like games and action, but don't expect feeling good when coming out of this drama.

I like the two main characters Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin (actress & actor). At the begin, I watch this drama because of Park Shin Hye, after following the story episode 1 & 2; I feel it's very interesting then I continue to watch all. I like Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin, they have very good chemistry (in real life). I hope they can work together with another romance drama. In this drama, Park Shin Hye (Jung Hee Joo ) and Hyun Bin (Yoo Jin Woo) only have a little romance scene, they have two-time dates and then everything would go wrong in the story. The drama doesn't show any a good romance story between both of them if they have, it is very short.

The story's interesting because it shows the mix in between the real world, magic and the game. It tells the future, the experience of the gaming world and the imagination of development of new technology in the future.

Furthermore, I disliked Jung Hee Joo character in the story, this one I can blame the writer, Jung Hee Joo character seem like a support character more than the main character in the story. The character is too weak and cries a lot.
Park Shin Hye already did her best to save this character. Another thing that I dislike is, the writer did not explain clearly of the story and how the game end. In my opinion, the story is good at the begin and getting worse at the end.

Overall, I think Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin had done their best job to save the characters in the story. The writer had wasted the actress and actor's skill to show a perfect ending.

The questions I have:

Episode 7: If the game was started in Spain. How the hell he was able to crawl to the outside world like US or Seoul in korea?? This thing does not make any sense and talking about the AI games in seoul I think that's the whole new game engine used to build.

Episode 9: Something is quite strange in here.. How can his Ally die from the NPCs. I mean from the starting of the game, If a person dies from any NPC then that person will be logged out. and afterwards he can log in again and fight back. Alright talking about (Jeong-Hun), He can kill both (Mr.Yoo) & (////) if he wants because of the Allay partnership. But why they've changed the whole meaning here and No explanation about it that if you level up you can die.

Episode 12: I'm actually loving the Sweet Bitter Relationship and i really like (Mr.Yoo) being Honest in every way. That's exactly how a relationship should be, just be honest with you prtner no matter what.

Episode 16:.. No how could you.. What the hell No Nooo Atleast let them see each other. For God sake. I was actually going to cry that they're are gonna meet each other. what the hell is going on here.. I'm really pissed off now.

This drama presents a new challenge for me to not stop watching it. It's incredibly enchanting. The plot is so unpredictable and full of startling events. The idea of the story is so fresh and it pursues me to know more about virtual game.

The acting of the casts has made me involve into the story. Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye have really made me fall in love with. Their acting is so perfect. Each character in this drama has strong mindfullness.

The setting of this drama can be another great poin for me. When they chose Alhambra palace, so I think the story can be so intriguing spiritually. And I am not wrong. The combination of the spiritual and historical value gives the strong plot of the story. A new technology of virual game is really something new I can get from this drama also.

Finally the twist of this drama is so perfect for me. I love the end of this story. And I bet so many viewers will fall in love with beautiful view of Granada and enchanting Alhambra palace.

Interesting Take on Gaming
Memories of the Alhambra was a very interesting series that definitely kept me on my toes.
As you watch, you think you start to understand what's going on but then the series will take a turn.
I think the acting and chemistry between the actors was great. They really helped draw you in since there is a little bit of everything emotion wise.
When it comes to the gaming part, this show takes a different approach than other gaming related shows and I think that's what makes the show so great. Memories of the Alhambra does a great job of appealing to gamers and non gamers alike so this show truly is for everyone.

Good cast, fun game idea, terrific game sequences, cool mystery.....human story that lags behind. This could have been a great drama if the human story was as strong as the gameplay.

This starts off strong with a mystery and dynamic game play and strong conflict between the leading characters. Then the motives and story for the humans gets muddled and isn’t as interesting as the game. And then it gets worse when the editing jumbles up time periods in an attempt to make more plot and give depth to the story.

It’s a missed opportunity if only someone could make the second half as strong as the first. And let’s not even start on that ending....

Sigh.

Oh, Al-Hambra, the drama that could've been.

When I first tuned in to Memories of Al-Hambra, I was blown away by the visuals and the AR set up. It was a wet dream for a video game enthusiast like myself. From the get-go, it's clear to viewers that no expenses were spared for the production.

Unfortunately, my love did not extend to how the plot progressed. As with this writer's dramas, the more you watch, the more do questions pop up. And when you get to the end, you are just a confused mess. If I could identify the point where things go haywire, I would generously put it at episode 10. The first 6 episodes were drawn out, yet managed to remain enjoyable and relatively logical for an illogical setup. The plot did pick up at episode 7, but I found myself reading recaps after 10. Things started to get repetitive and it's because of the drama's biggest flaw: it's centrality to one character, Jinwoo.

Now, if you are familiar with video games, a lot of them share the same idea where you have one protagonist who goes on a quest and the game basically follows them. The drama followed this format, where everything revolved around Jinwoo and all characters were to some extent, plot devices; Jinwoo is always in action while others just react. I didn't really care for this aspect of the drama. I know it received a lot of criticism, but I actually found it refreshing. However, for a 16 episode drama, it could get quite boring. Imagine watching 16 hours of a character being pushed around, then fighting, then receiving moral support, then upgrading, then fighting again.. you get the gist. It's not a narrative that suits a drama of such length, which is one of the primary reasons why it lost me.

Another reason though would be character development. I actually love Jinwoo's character. As he is the protagonist, the writer obviously took her time to flesh him out. He was flawed, charming, and quite heroic. I really liked his change throughout the drama. You can see his vibrancy, that energy he was bursting with, just being drained away as the plot progresses. Kudos to Hyun Bin who did an utterly fantastic job in his portrayal of a complex character of this sort; it's why I kept tuning in. I wish I could say the same to other characters, or perhaps, the other? "" main"" character: Hee-ju. The writer herself said that the story was centralized around the male lead, and that she added Hee-ju because of Park Shinhye's casting (I read that a while ago, so apologies if I am wrong, but it explains a lot). For the entire drama, all Heeju did was cry, run, and offer moral support. Hell, Secretary Seo had more of an active part than she did. It was so obvious that her character was an afterthought. She existed for Jinwoo and only for Jinwoo. It was such a shame, because Hee-ju had so much potential as a character, for she was caring and passionate.

Overall, Al-Hambra is a good drama. It had fantastic music, beautiful ambiance, and a great performance by the actions. However, the story would leave you unsatisfied and confused. It's like a cheat day where you are just biting into the cake you've fantasized about, but it's taken away before you eat it. Yes, that's the perfect analogy. Props to me.

Would I rewatch this? Yes. I would definitely watch until episode, say, 8. I do think you should give it a try though; it might end up to be your cup of tea. Just don't raise your expectations.

Just watch ""W: Two Worlds"" instead, it's much more satisfying and edge-of-your-seat compared to this lukewarm soup.

The story had great potential in the beginning and then went downhill because it lacked clear direction, meandering towards interesting concepts but never fully exploring them. At the end you're left with a nagging feeling that this could have been so much better than what it ended up being. I'm still upset by how big of a letdown it was.

The cast's acting was on point but I kind of see where critics of Park Shin Hye come from; there's nothing overtly wrong with her acting but there were moments where I was taken out of the immersion because of her. I still like her though.

The music is phenomenal and doesn't deserve this show.

Rewatch value... none. I went into this with high expectations because W is one of my all-time favorite dramas and this had the same writer. I was so ecstatic, expecting another masterpiece that would blow me away. Instead I wasted half the show playing games on my phone because I was bored. Rewatching this would be like dragging me backwards through hell for the 9th time :'(

Verdict: don't bother. The romance might appeal to some but there are a ton of shows out there that have way better writing and characterization. If you're looking for a twisty and interesting sci-fi kdrama, the following are much better alternatives:

- Are You Human? (Seo Kang Joon. nuff said)
- Duel (hot doppelgangers ahoy)
- Circle (flashbacks with actual purpose)
- I'm Not a Robot (heavily more romance than sci-fi, but I'm recommending this because the romance is so much better than this show)
- The Gifted (Thai drama of students with powers)
- W: Two Worlds (my one and only love!)

This is drama is entertaining to watch, but there were so many holes in the logic behind this drama. It's supposed to be based around an Augmented Reality (AR) game that is played with some lenses that this big tech company sells. This implies that the series is gonna be a Science Fiction series, but around 3 or 4 episodes in you really have to give up on the idea that this is a Sci-Fi series and just think of it as a Fantasy series.

Without giving any spoilers, one of the logic holes is that in this AR game you fight with swords, and you can fight Non-Player Characters (NPCs) with your sword on the game. Well the only technology introduced in the drama was a set of lenses that transpose the game's graphics into the real world, but when a player fights with an NPC and the player's sword clashes with the NPC's sword, that collision of two virtual objects is felt by the player, i.e. its as if literally two physical swords clashed. What is the technology behind this? It is never explained or addressed.

If they had only said something like 'the lenses connect to the users cranial nerve system (CNS) and can simulate physical forces by sending signals to the CNS which will ultimately result in a real life-like experience for the users.' I would've been happy, sure the technology to achieve that hasn't been discovered, but its certainly plausible and feasible from a futuristic perspective, but none of that was ever approached by the drama.

There are other aspects in the drama which are simply not explained (which I won't enter into details so I don't spoil the story), but what's important is that up to the very end of the drama, the notion of this being a sci-fi drama is kept. At no point is it acknowledged that something impossible has happened, rather they call some of that stuff 'bugs' which is the computer science term for faults in the LOGIC of a PROGRAM which implies sci-fi, and yet nothing was ever explained.

Story
The idea of the story is integrating a game universe and real universe, which somehow weirdly unique.
The story began with a jaw dropping starts. The story progresses steady but too slow. I really love the core story, but the tempo kills the excitement of watching this.
The problem is that there were too many unnecessary details and time shifts to explain minor incidents that happened before rather than explaining what will happen and what happened with the core story.
Acting
Hyun Bin potrays Jin Woo perfectly. The suffer is so real and I am amazed how great he was potraying this character.
On the other hand, Park Shin Hye started awkwardly. Jung Hee Ju seems to be so awkward and out of places. But it started to get better as the story progress.
The other cast did their job great, especially the ""bugs"".
The chemistry between the leads is great, but not the best.
Ost
The only great ost is Is You by Ailee. The rest are average.

I love this drama so much. I love the concept, idea, or whatever it's called. It's just like anime titled ""Sword Art Online"", players are playing AR games, if they die in the game so do they in real life. I enjoyed the story... at least until I watched episode 13.
This drama is controversial. You know, before you make a history-based story/script, you should learn the real history first. Then, when you put it to your story, you HAVE TO put that history-line to your story as it is. You should NOT falsely rewrite the history onto your script. If you don't know the truth or what the world know about that history, then DON'T write it. It makes controversy, makes many people mad, and people will unite to prosecute the actors, actress, director, writer, etc.
It's just same as this drama. On 13th episode, there are lines tell you about one of most believed religions in the world, Islam. I bet, the writer has not done the research about Fatima, Muhammad, Islam, and the history of Granada itself. Once again I tell you, reader. If it has to do with, race, religion, ethnic, history, and so on, you can not take it a joke. Don't even rewrite their history falsely. If you want to create novel, script, or anything that has to do with them, then you HAVE TO research it, do interview with scientist, professor, etc., and make sure yours is legit enough to be published. If you CAN'T, then just find another theme, genre, or whatever it's called. I feel sorry for Park Shin Hye who had to do the lines. I hope people/netizens out there don't blame her. It's the writer's fault.

The plot seemed interesting and I like both Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin + it was partially filmed in Spain (yay!) and I've been to Granada, Girona and Barcelona multiple times, so I was familiar with the setting. I was SO excited to watch it, ever since the news came out, but somehow it was...boring? slow? it felt like nothing was going on and there were way too many time jumps and I just don't know. It wasn't for me and I didn't think it was worth pushing it more because that's what I had been doing since like episode 5. It had everything (minus the romance, although a drama doesn't need romance for me to enjoy it and also I didn't really see the romantic chemistry between the leads, but that's just me) so I should have enjoyed it. But I didn't lol. Definitely check it out and see it for yourself.

Unique Kdrama
I have seen so many dramas and this one is one of the kind. First off all is a unique story, you can never predict what will happen in the next moment, was the only drama i have seen and i have not guess what will happen. The male leader he pass difficult times not in his past but in his present. What a great acting Hyun Bin is perfect , you can feel his pain. I love his character. Touching relationships like him and his secretary. You will see it and you will not forget it in an hour because you can think it again and again you have a lot to explain in your mind . The story is without holes with many meanings. And if you are a gamer is a big extra. I love it and for first time i want to write something for a drama because i cant forget it. Only i want to say sorry for my poor english is so many things i want to express and i cant say it ?

Completely unforeseen drama!! I gotta say I don't like a lot of Hyun Bin Dramas but with Park Shin Hye it is an unstoppable plotful drama. I missed her a lot. I'm hopeful for a good ending but this ish is getting twisted! I can't wait for the next episodes!! so exhilarating. Get the popcorn ready kids because you're in for a ride!! Also, I love that it's based in a different country!! so awesome & refreshing!! Park Shin Hye's acting is of course on point and their pronunciations are so good. I wonder if she really knows how to speak spanish and english irl or if she just memorized the script. Either way she's FANTASTIC!!!

No clear ending
Everything is fine, story, casting, places, music... but... the final ending? What´s it? Were directors out of cash? Out of memory in the hard disk? Really, really angry with a very good drama recorded at beautiful Granada with this poor ending. He was just deleted... C´mon... Any intern could write a better final ending... I will haven´t good Memories of the Alhambra. Netflix, I want my subscription money back... Just kidding : )

I had high expectations for this drama as its writer is the same with W. W really blew my mind from the pacing, the characters and damn the plot twists on the first episodes because I didn't really expect any of that. However, Memories of Alhambra seems so lacking in many ways.

The first episode was a good start as it was really intriguing and magical. I absolutely love the AR theme, very timely and witty. It was really action-packed which is the thing that I always anticipate on every episode. But things got really repetitive and tedious when Hyung-seok keeps on showing up. I stopped watching it for awhile because the story did not pique my curiosity anymore. Episodes 4-7 were very trivial for me. The Memories of Alhambra (guitar piece) keeps on playing more than twice in an episode and it did get on my nerves at some point. The story picked up its pace again sometime later when we got back to Korea. I guess they just wanted the drama to reach 16 episodes so the scenes on Granada were very lengthy and unnecessary. I then read comments online that Hee Joo's character was also unnecessary and I began to realize that they were right. The story could really go on without her presence and help. The thing with this writer is that he writes in a fast paced manner so I did not get enough time to sympathize with the characters' feelings. Hyun Bin was great but his lines and scenes were really lacking. As for the music, it should have been more suspenseful as this drama is a thriller one. I anticipated it to have lots of sfx to really shock the viewers but it didn't. The guitar piece was overly used. It's where the drama got its title but it doesn't really have a major impact for me.

Let's jump to the finale episode which was a disappointment but I'm really glad it's open ended because if not, there would have tons of plot holes here and there. However, the ending was not satisfying at all. We mostly got scenes on the church with the characters looking at the ashes the whole damn time. We also got a flashback of everything that happened where I realized it was not a roller coaster kind of ride. The story focused mainly on Jin Woo playing the game and finding Se Ju. The story only unfolded just to reveal the past and find Se Ju. This drama should have been entitled Finding Se Ju seriously. To sum up, it was an okay drama for it is very unique and truly magical. It may be flawed on some of its elements but it is still worth watching especially if you are an avid online game user.

Story: This is a first drama where I've seen a story concept revolving with VR Gaming. It seems like a good idea and very promising. It definitely showed the positive aspects of it but a lot more negative aspects for the majority of the drama. It's a confusing drama nonetheless. There are a lot of flashbacks that's suppose to clear up the confusion but at the same time, there were too many flashbacks that I consider unnecessary. They could've just showed the scenes in order instead of always going back and forth. The story drags though. It's so slow that I almost quit watching it halfway. The main focus is the VR Gaming issue so if you're looking for romance, this is not your drama. It had the potential to be a great drama but I felt like it fell far away from that for me.

Acting/Cast: I enjoy the actors & actresses in this drama however their roles were kinda lack luster for me. Hyun-Bin as Jin-Woo had all the action scenes but very little romantic scenes with Hee-Joo. Park Shin-Hye role as Hee-Jo was very boring to me. I was hoping she would get some toughness in her role like what I've seen in Doctors but that didn't happen. Her role as Hee-Jo wasn't memorable to me but as Emma, it was. Same issue with Hee-Jo, lack of chemistry for Jin-Woo which results in lack of scenes of them together.

Music: By far the best part of this drama was the music. Ailee's song ""Is You"" & Yang Da Il's song ""I'm Here"" were my favorite two osts from this drama but every other music played in this drama I've enjoyed listening to as well.

Rewatch?: Not worth rewatching for me because of the slow story progression, lack of romance & chemistry between the leads and I wasn't fond of the writing.

I initially wanted to watch this show for Park Shin Hye, but I soon realized she'd be just a supporting character this time. However, I was hooked by the game concept, the story line and Hyun Bin's portrayal of the main character kept me glued to this show until the end.
One thing I have to criticize the writer is - again - the way she writes her female characters. This is something that ruined W for me, and in Memories of Alhambra made the romance feel forced and unnecessary. I couldn't help but sigh at the waste of Park Shin Hye's time for this show.
I still enjoyed it, however. I'd reccomend it for those who enjoys a drama packed with suspense and action, and that will leave you with questions after every episode, this might be for you.

So Much Potential
I really enjoyed the first half of this drama, it was well acted, well paced and the story was interesting and not the usual genre I sway towards. I just wishes it hadn't gone on so long, I think 3 or 4 episodes shaved off would have helped the drag towards the end. It took me a while to get through but I had watched the first half in about a week. The setting in Spain was beautiful and different, I enjoyed the parts set there the most.

I liked all of the actors and hope to check them out in other titles.

This drama explores the dangers of VCR games. How it messes with your head and ruins your life.

Story:
The story centers only around pitiful Yoo Jin-Woo whose life became a mess ever since he started playing the game. He payed a high price and lost everything without deserving what he got. But he was the BIGGER MAN because he took responsibility and truly tried to fix other's mistakes especially towards Se-Joo.

Every other character is just a flat character that supports the plot especially Hee-Ju (a waste of Park Shin Hye's talent).

The plot:
It started out as gem. I enjoyed it until the last episode. I felt let down by the hero's last quest. He ended up being literally ""a ransom for many.""

The Acting:
Everyone fulfilled their roles perfectly even those who were only there to cry. Min Jin Woong was AMAZING!

Relationships?
The only real relationship Yoo Jin-Woo had, ever since he started playing, was with his secretary. Even with Hee-Ju, he was not able to settle. So if you're looking for a fulfilling romance you'll be disappointed. Maybe it was meant to show how these games makes human relations distant and meaningless.

Last words:
I would not re-watch this drama even though I rated it 8.5.

Recommendations:
Watch this drama if you're into mild action or mmorpg games.
Don't binge watch this or you'll easily get fed up.

A lunar apocalypse.
Silence is not empty, it's full of answers. It's upon us to find them out and unless there is an effort, it remains in nothingness. The sea that is full of beings, has the capability to engulf the entire world in it's womb, yet it knows it's limits. But what about the sea that's sleeping silently somewhere out there in the universe and knows no way of self-control? That's what we are here to discover.

THE SILENT SEA (고요의 바다) is a mixture of sci-fi, thriller and apocalypse; it has no romance elements and unlike most Netflix Korea shows, it's not gore and creepy, which means even for a thriller, it's not a heavy watch. The story is presumably an adaptation of ""The Sea of Tranquility (2014), created by the director of this show. The drama is set up in far future (probably 100 years ahead). The world has changed a lot and the climate change has brought forward severe issues. Simultaneously, the development in case of aeroscience has sky-rocketed, resulting in easier travel to different planets and facile communication with earth.

A team of 11 has been formed to recover important samples from the moon, before they could shut down a station that faced a tragic accident 5 years ago, killing all the inmates. The team travels their on the spaceship 'Nuri 11' and sets out to 'Balhae Space Station' located on the lunar land. On their mission of retrieving the sample, they discover unusual activities and come to find out mysterious facts about the station that had happened 5 years back.

Song Ji An (Bae Doo Na) is a scientist who previously served as an astrobiologist but had to switch after a tragic incident to her sister. She was convinced to go on the mission. Han Yoon Jae (Gong Yoo) is a soldier for the space agency, who joins the team as it's captain. Dr. Jian's knowledge and Capt. Yoon Jae's leadership, are what drives the entire show.

Dr. Hong (Kim Sun Young) is a doctor who joined the team to provide medical assistance. Chief. Gong Soo Hyuk (Lee Moo Saeng) is also a space soldier who joins the team along with his space engineer brother Gong Soo Chan (Jung Soon Won). Lieutenant Ryu Tae Suk (Lee Joon), Chief Kim Jae Sun (Heo Sung Tae) are some other major characters.

The plot development is nice. The first 2 episodes that were expected to lay an introductory foundation, did a good job in establishing a good impression, except that they were slow paced. The space scenarios and the lunar premise were pretty intriguing to witness, for it also created a good amount of curiosity about what is next. I can't say that the entire story is immensely intriguing, because it had problems with pacing and storytelling. I expected some more back stories and for all of the characters, but it's understandable given the limited runtime. The gradual unfolding of mysterious facts and intentionally hidden secrets, were indeed intriguing. The ending, ummm, not something fabulous, that I was expecting but I liked how simple and meaningful it was.

Netflix Korea seems to be giving chances to previously failed or lesser experienced directors, writers and makers but it must try providing them with resources to nurture their skills. Just like Squid Game's, the director of this drama lacks profundity, though the show is not mediocre like SG. The pacing is inconsistent, not slow or rushed constantly that makes it boring or uninteresting of some sort, but a little noticeable.

The sound production is apt bcs it's Netflix, haha. The screen-editing is quite good; the connecting plots, revelations of elements and the suspense build up is up to par. CGI, well, Netflix is surely trying to improve thia area after serious criticisms; it was visible through this show. Even so, the CGI was actually poor in first 2 episodes, I can't lie about it though it improved with episode.

Writer Park Eun Kyo is an underutilized talent. She might seem a rookie to the audience, but she's the co-writer of the critically acclaimed Bong Joon Ho directed movie, ""Mother (2009)"". The basic concept of this show, though taken from another movie, had to rely on a well-written script, as the short movie was turned into a 360 minutes webseries. In that regard, jakka-nim has done a pretty good job. The overal story and screenwriting might not be something amazing, but overally as a show, it's a nice piece. Few things about the spaceship that went wary in the first episode could have been easily avoided but duh..

The drama addresses future world problems that we now only assume and predict with theoretical studies. The world has undergone enormous transformation due to severe climatic changes over years. Because of desertification, there is a scarcity of water as the water bodies including the sea dries down. All these are the concerns of future societies. The drama also narrates the possibilities that the future beholds in the area of space and planetary researches.

The pseudo-science created for the drama is compelling for sure. It is less of space science and more of a creative or fictional astro-biology. The lunar premise and the technological advancements are what we are gonna see in far future. Space show, in all aspects, is a new premise in the K-drama industry and it's good to see that it didn't entirely go phut. This is to a great extent an experimental drama. Just keep in mind that, the basic idea of the drama relies on astro-biology and not aero or lunar science.

There is a clear message of how greed and over-ambitious anticipations can bring destruction to mankind, even when it gives greater scope of research in science. Regret, responsibility and guilt are some other major elements incorporated in the characters. Good news is that, unlike many other Netflix Korea shows, The Silent Sea doesn't end with a cliffhanger. It didn't leave any single thing open or showcase any possibility of another season.

Overally, ""The Silent Sea"" is a good and interesting one time watch. The sci-fi elements and the actors are the prior reasons to watch this drama. I wasn't expecting anything excellent outta it since it's after all a Netflix Korea original show which is famous for creating 6/10 stupid shows. But anyways, this was good and moderately likable judging from all the points; be it technical and cinematic aspects or the message it wanted to convey. It's not very nice, still a decent watch, for sure.

P. S. Can't cite it bad just because of the poor CGI and faulty space facts used solely. There are plenty of aspects in a drama to be judged.

Pretty but soulless
The Silent Sea seems to have all the right ingredients, from premise to set design to casting, but unfortunately somehow failed to truly grab my full attention.
I don’t consider my time with this show wasted at all, I did sit through all eight episodes in three days after all, but this is not a drama I see myself ever coming back to nor thinking about ever again

Visually speaking, this is a very impressive show. Probably the most expensive-looking Asian drama I have ever watched. The CGI definitely didn’t disappoint. And yet, for the most part, the cinematography didn’t leave a strong impression on me. Not implying that it was bad, not at all, I consider this to be a pretty visually stimulating drama, but it wasn’t anything more than competent. None of the shots felt bland or flat per-se but I can’t shake off the feeling, that The Silent Sea just lacked a certain something. Nice to look at, but not particularly interesting. The only thing I can say with certainty is that this show is dark, thematically, but also literally at many parts. So dark in fact, that at many points I was having real difficulties figuring out what was going on. That can be a stylistic choice of course, but I still don’t feel like it was an exactly smart one.

However, in my opinion, the biggest fault of the drama lies in the characters, which I couldn’t bring myself to really care about. For starters, I thought that many of them were too similar in personality. But I also just failed to connect with anyone emotionally. I don’t think that the actors are at fault here, if anything I was more than pleased with everyone’s performance, but it seems like The Silent Sea didn’t leave any room to showcase human emotion. For the most part, I don’t feel like we got to know anybody. There were very few scenes where I got a clear image of the crew’s dynamic with each other. I don’t need media to have banter and funny and witty one-liners every second scene, in a Marvel-movie-fashion, but I still needed something, anything from The Silent Sea that would have convinced me that these are truly individual people with their individual flaws, strengths, quirks, aspiration, and dreams.

Plot-wise I think this show was fine. The premise was what originally attracted me and the twists and turns kept me engaged, but I really do feel like a story can only be as strong as its characters and unfortunately, this drama just missed the mark here.

Please don't read this and conclude that I consider this to be a bad drama, I truly don't but it didn't really leave me feeling anything. It didn't make me smile (which, considering the genre, was to be expected), it didn't make me sad, it didn't frighten me, it didn't even really make me think about anything much.

Would I recommend The Silent Sea? Kinda a tough question. Personally speaking, it didn’t hit the spot, but I also feel like this might come down to a personal preference in genres. If you like science-fiction, violence, and (most importantly) cool-looking space-stuff, I’m sure you’ll have a field day with this. If you’re looking for a more emotional experience, maybe skip this one.

Did I watch the same show as everyone else?
After watching this, I've found myself so disappointed that I really have to ask myself: did I watch the same show as everyone else?

This was a show I eagerly anticipated watching. I was over the moon (haha) when I heard this drama was airing soon. I was expecting something amazing. A stellar cast, with a celestial horror/mystery? Count me in!!
Looking at the other reviews and comments about this show, it looks like, generally, most people have been really liking this show. So it puzzles me that I had such major issues with this show that it seems that other people did not have. I'm honestly wondering if there's just something I'm missing here.

One of my biggest problems with this show was the characters. I had no problems with the characters during the first episode. They seemed interesting and unique, and I was curious to see where they'd go with Bae Doo Na's character. And I had no doubt that the excellent cast, which was one of the main reasons I was excited for the show, would be able to deliver quality performances.

Where the drama went sharply downhill for me was about the second episode or so. My problem was that I could not understand why the characters were acting the way they were acting. Here's what I mean. As soon as the scientists make it to the space station, it is exceedingly obvious that there's something not right here at all. The drowning victims, the lack of radiation. More importantly, there's the people dying terrifying, unnatural deaths. But during all of this, I could not understand why the scientists seemed to unbothered?? Obviously, they shouldn't start panicking or running around like headless chickens but I feel like they don't seemed fazed enough? There's not enough of a sense of urgency in their actions despite the profoundly distressing situation. It's so bizarre to me I felt like a crazy person watching the show. I just could not understand these characters. Now, I think this does improve later in the show, where the characters act more logically. But by this point I'd already lost much of my interest in the characters and their success.

However, my biggest problem with the show was probably the plot. I hate crying plagiarism for no reason and I'm NOT saying that this drama plagiarized. But the set up was so similar to this Doctor Who episode I watched in the past. I think it's called ""The Waters of Mars"" or something? Anyways, both of them have the set up of these astronauts in space at the mercy of a sickness spread by water. I think they both even have the infected person expelling huge quantities of water, though that might just be in this show. And, to be fair, I can't remember enough of the details regarding the backstory and the characters to say that the two are similar in this regard. I digress. But what the problem for me was that the novel premise of the threatening water in the space station fell flat for me because I'd already seen it before. I was able to predict so much what happened, which killed a lot of the mystery and suspense for me. And I'm usually someone that's terrible at predicting what's going to happen next when I'm watching dramas!
To be fair to the show, the backstory behind the water, Luna, and the newer parts of the plot were in the last two or so episodes, which I skipped through a lot. I probably should've given the show more of a chance with these elements of it, but by this point I was so disappointed and annoyed I couldn't care enough. And the elements with the drought on Earth were interesting, but they weren't explored enough for me to give the show much more credit there.

Basically, to sum up my feelings, I really did not like this show. The suggested overall rating that MDL is giving me for this review is a 5/10, and that probably would be more fair. But I'm just so bitter about this show I can't give it more than a 3/10. I really wanted to like it, and I was so sure I would. However, this show just really didn't work for me. I would still recommend it if you're interested, though, since a lot of people seem to like it a lot.

Gong Yoo And Bae Doona Were My Main Reasons For Watching…
In all honesty I sort of feel as though opinions on this show are greatly divided and I can understand why.

I’m a big Gong Yoo fan. I love his works and typically trust his project decisions just as Bae Doona is a brilliant actress and I’m often blown away by her performances. But I often struggled to warm up to their characters. The drama rarely gave us opportunities to really grow to any of the onscreen main leads and supporting cast? It’s hard to explain fully but there were never real moments which were particularly emotional or really made you fall in love with the characters.

As a non sci-fi fan I can’t really say that I’m overly familiar with this genre but I do know that a lot of the storyline did strike a slight chord with me as a bit same-old. I liked how the series helped to show you elements of the world that the series was set in but apart from that it did feel a bit boring.

The pacing was also very slow. I get that the intention was to make you wait and see what would happen but it did turn me off a little during scenes to actually engage in the storyline.

Overall I wouldn’t say this is a bad drama per say but mediocre. I know that South Korea is still pretty new to this kind of genre and I guess we have to take that on board as watchers, but I’ve certainly seen better takes on this genre by South-Korean directors in recent years.

Dark Side of the Moon
Mysterious. Suspenseful. Terrifying. Emotional. For me, these are the key attributes and main selling points of The Silent Sea as it takes viewers literally to the dark side of the moon through the perspectives of an eclectic team of space explorers in the not-too-distant future.

Based on the 2014 short film, The Sea of Tranquility, conceived by Choi Hang Yong who also directs, the screenplay adaptation is written by Park Eun Kyo. Composer and new age musician Lee Ji Soo serves as music director with his original score performed by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. This Netflix original sci-fi K-drama is executive produced by Jung Woo Sung. Production began in April 2020 with principal photography taking place in August 2020.

The story is set during a time when the Earth is being depleted of its most important natural resource - water. The moon represents a viable extraterrestrial option for advanced research into harnessing water conservation methods as part of wider efforts for ensuring the survival of mankind. However, a mass casualty event on the lunar space station-cum-research facility becomes the catalyst for an expedition to retrieve crucial research samples and data. A crew of scientists are assembled for this time-sensitive assignment. What awaits the team on the ground constitutes the core narrative and underlying mystery of the drama. There are parallels to be drawn with other sci-fi films such as Event Horizon, Life, and even Alien that share similar themes - journeying into the unknown, unravelling the secrets that lie beyond, and making the ultimate sacrifice for the human race.

In addition to the high tension, deep sense of foreboding and the sinister aura surrounding the mystery on the moon, the drama intimately examines the dynamics of the crew, amidst their hidden agendas and personal motivations. The global water shortage which resulted in a devastating event designated ""The Great Drought"" has precipitated enforcement of draconian laws that promote inequality of water accessibility. This provides the necessary backdrop for socio-political, ecological and environmental subtexts that are subtly hinted at.

For the most part, the storytelling manages to fuse all these elements cohesively and coherently. It establishes beforehand the necessary world-building that enables viewers to connect to the reality of the fictional settings, where the basis of the science isn’t overly complicated and the technology does not appear particularly advanced. Nonetheless, some suspension of disbelief is required where accuracy in the application of the laws of physics as well as the realism of spaceflights and moon landings are concerned.

In terms of the production quality and sci-fi settings, The Silent Sea well and truly delivers in this respect. The set designs of the space shuttles and base facilities, as well as the conceptual imaginings of the moon itself along with the desolation of a dystopian South Korea are remarkably detailed and life-like. This is largely attributed to the well rendered visual effects and CGI, courtesy of the South Korean VFX specialist Westworld, which is actively involved in Netflix's Korean productions the likes of Sweet Home and Squid Game. The resulting visuals are complemented by the exceptional sound production. Evocative mood music forms a prominent part of the original score that sets the overall ambience of the production.

The costume design of the spacesuits is rather interesting, given that they appear much sleeker in comparison with the NASA Intravehicular suits (IVA) seen in recent space films like Sandra Bullock's Gravity. The drama features action sequences to a certain extent, onboard the spacecraft but mostly within the confines of the lunar base.

Both cast and characterization deserve praise for their presentation in this production. Embodying the diverse multifaceted characters are an ensemble cast headlined by Gong Yoo and Bae Doona. I don’t think I need to wax lyrical about how critically acclaimed they are or their long list of accolades. I’ve been a huge fan of both but particularly of Bae Doona over the years. In this drama, they each brought their A game in their respective portrayals of the rather inscrutable but profoundly layered leads, team leader Captain Han Yoon Jae and astrobiologist / ethologist Dr. Song Ji An. Displaying extraordinary depth and gamut of emotions, I wouldn’t expect any less from either of them.

Lee Joon returns in his first drama since his discharge from military service in 2019 (although his second comeback drama, Bulgasal: Immortal Souls was released slightly earlier). He portrays the understated and somewhat straight-laced Lt. Ryu Tae Seok. Kim Sun Yeong plays the team medic, Dr. Hong Ga Young, who is perhaps the most upbeat and fun character in the group.

My third time seeing Heo Sung Tae in a supporting role this year, after Beyond Evil and Squid Game. This time he plays government bigwig Kim Jae Sun, which is a departure and a somewhat welcome change from his usually more unsavoury characters. His co-star from Beyond Evil, Kil Hae Yon also makes an appearance as the official of the Space Aeronautics Administration, Director Choi Guk Jang, who comes across as manipulative and highly suspicious.

Kang Mal Geum has had a prolific year, appearing in no less than five dramas and I happened to have watched them all. This experienced actress has a minor but no less important role in this drama. Child actress Kim Shi Ah is also deserving of a shout-out for her second appearance of the year, since her brief cameo in Kingdom: Ashin of the North. This young talent certainly has a knack for choosing high profile Netflix productions as well as dramatic roles.

I’m quite pleased with how the mystery was crafted and depicted. Although what happens afterwards - as far as the future of Earth and its inhabitants are concerned - is never shown or explained, the focus of the story was always going to be on Song Ji An. The source material is indicative of this approach as well. This has been a captivating and immersive viewing experience for me where I got to appreciate some very fine acting from a stellar cast amidst the spectacular visuals and effects of a sci-fi setting.

How to Survive a 24hours mission on the moon: The Silent Sea Method
1. You need Gong Yoo, Bae Doona and great physique (well, the actors do, I’m just pretending I can run). Be prepare to run. Run. Run. Run. And jump. Communication with Gong Yoo is a must. He’s the captain and the guy in charge. If you don’t maintain comms and do what he says, he will remind you. Bae Doona will only answer you if you have something scientific to add into the conversation.

2. Prepare to go on a mission with minimal information. Remember, you’re a good soldier. So, do what Capt. Gong say, and you will be alright. Information will only be feed to you by second and fourth episode. Fifth episode, you sort off get the full picture.

3. Get your Binge-session/marathon-session routine ready. Comfy clothing is a must. Air-conditioner/heater needs to be in working order. Don’t forget food and drinks. If you’re watching via your laptop, ensure your charger is within reach. You can also thanks to the Netflix crew to do a full release of this 8-episode drama.

4. Be thankful of the clean water you’re drinking right now. Just do.

5. If you’re not into genres of space and pseudo thriller, this not the tv series for you. If you’re into some mindless thriller fluff with fantastic cast, you may enjoy this to end 2021.

Amazing Cast !
I have mixed- feelings about’ The Silent Sea’ and it seems a lot of people on the platform shared likewise emotions.

On one hand I think that the storyline was intriguing and having read prior reviews I think that it was amazing that the director of the original film also decided to film this one.

I also loved the main cast. I’m familiar with our leads as if you begin to become immersed in Korean dramas then you become accustomed to these names and their involvement in their works.

However where my more critical views came through a few factors; the storyline and the filming styles and techniques .

The biggest problem I found with the storyline was that in theory it should’ve been impactful but I struggled to become enticed by the characters as their presence onscreen felt very controlled and enforced by the screenwriter rather than natural. This often resulted in characters feeling a bit boring onscreen.

My other peeve was that the series was really reliant on CGI. I don’t think this is always necessarily a bad thing entirely as after all it is a series set in space and the future but in all honesty the CGI wasn’t entirely the best. It wouldn’t be too bad perhaps if the series had attempted to present this more with real-life scenes but this often created a sort of trippy feel to scenes.
The ending wasn’t entirely bad per day but I did feel like it didn’t quite finish off the events of the storyline.

Mixed emotions on this one
I had high expectations but the length (at least 1/3 too much) and the biological/physical nonsense heavily damaged watching this series.
I liked the idea of discussing the future of water, which covers most of the world today, makes up most of the human body, and was even understood as a principle in the formation of the universe in early Greek philosophy, and is threatened by human activities. I liked the experiment on the goldfish. I liked the clashes of interests regarding the mission on the Moon.
In my eyes, showing how lunar water had been identified, then mined, leading to the establishment of the base, would have improved the production.
The problems now.
The plot is meaningless as - even accepting the biological impossibilities presented - the company interested in putting its paws on the resources in the base could have just sent its own craft and crew. There was no need to infiltrate the space agency mission.
The plot is - separately - meaningless because of the many impossibilities presented:
1. One can't see a virus using the microscope used,
2. and can't even see a bacterium unless one prepares the bacterium by first staining it.
3. Genetic modifications in one biosystem cannot become antibodies in another one.
4. The girl would have died of starvation,
5. and if she had exited the base, would have immediately frozen to death and be without breath.
6. Water cannot replicate as reported.
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
The writer(s) should have consulted KAIST and/or some other group/institute to mitigate the nonsense in the series. Bae Doona could have done chromatography on the water, investigated the plants, worked under hoods, irradiated/autoclaved stuff, and she would have realized if liquid water exists inside the base, parts thereof would exist as water vapor and thus cause the same effects as the liquid, ...
Now ""The Silent Sea"" will negatively affect me watching ""Stranger 3"" (if it comes out), since Bae Doona would have the leading female role (like in ""Stranger"" and ""Stranger 2"").

The “Silent” Show 
“The Silent Sea” tells the story of the critical space mission that will determine the future of planet earth. Even though the drama had its problems, it ended up an enjoyable and interesting ride.

The drama is a mystery horror thriller without any romantic aspect as it only focuses on the mission. Generally speaking, it isn’t creepy as it is gore and (a little) disgusting so I don’t consider it a heavy drama. The drama is also a Sci-Fi and that makes it not everyone’s cup of tea.


~~The Sci-Fi~~

The Sci-Fi of the drama is mainly about Biology, especially Astrobiology. I have to say that I found the Sci-Fi part pretty interesting and it was very well presented and delivered through the episodes. Using Astrobiology was one of the keys to success for the Sci-Fi theme because space is endless, full of mysteries and that lets the human’s imagination arise and make unique stories. Also, as we don’t know many things about space, the Sci-Fi part is more acceptable and less frustrating (unless you are an Astrobiologist I guess).

The Sci-Fi part reminded me of the “Panspermia Hypothesis” which basically says that “life began on Earth when the ""seeds"" of life, already present in the universe, arrived here from space”. I don’t know if the creators know about this hypothesis but I really like the fact that the resemblance with this hypothesis existed even if it wasn’t on purpose. If you watch the drama, you will understand this resemblance too.


~~The Pace and Storytelling~~

Slow but interesting, without action but suspenseful. This drama is very insidious, even though “silent” it manages to make the louder noise.

“The Silent Sea” is a slow burn drama, but it’s not boring. It takes it’s time to unfold the mystery and to create the right atmosphere. The suspense of the drama is built through the “unknown” factor and the process which will eventually lead to the knowledge and not through the violence and action scenes. Even the music of the drama is slow, mysterious, calm, hypotonic but also very interesting and aesthetically pleasing. As a lover of slow burn dramas, I really appreciate this drama’s aura.

“The Silent Sea” felt like a movie and this is a good but also, a bad thing.

The good thing first, it felt like a 7-hour movie, it was easy to binge and it didn’t lose its interest. The storytelling was very meticulously made. It had a start, a middle and an end united with a very good coherence. In other words, the story is a well-completed chapter.

The bad thing was that as a movie due to the lack of time has some undeveloped parts, “The Silent Sea” has some undeveloped parts too. The main undeveloped thing is the character’s depth. One of the advantages that series have over movies, is that they have the comfort to dedicate time to spend on the character building and on its development. “The Silent Sea” though didn’t dedicate the necessary time on this. All the characters were one-dimensional, even the ones with the backstories, and also, there isn’t any character development.

The second bad thing is the ending. Unfortunately, the story only focuses on the space mission and the mystery behind the accident but not to what happens after. As many movies, “The Silent Sea '' is dedicated to one action but not to the universe that this action is part of. Thus, I believe that “The Silent Sea” might have a second season.


~~Production and Acting~~

I don’t have much to say here, I am fully satisfied with both production and acting. Netflix paid much attention to their last Korean Drama of the year and the result was beautiful. “The Silent Sea” is just visually stunning with neat directing that contains beautiful space sceneries and scene transitions and with good quality VFX and CGI. The acting was great but the actors didn’t have the needed space to develop their portrayal through the drama and reach their full potential. Still, it was so nice to see these lovable actors on the screen again.


~~Overall~~

If you are a lover of Sci-Fi and slow burn dramas, but also a binge watcher, “The Silent Sea” is a very good choice. The story has some mistakes and some loose, rough points but generally, the storytelling is comprehensive in terms of its main theme and quite interesting. I don’t know if you will end up loving the drama or hate it but I believe that this drama will be an entertaining watching experience.

""In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream…""

Choi Han Yong’s ‘ The Silent Sea’ is a series which will like divide its audience demographic greatly. Notable A-listers such as Bae Doona and Gong Yoo will likely attract drama enthusiasts towards the drama’s cast lineup and involvement. However ‘The Silent Sea’’s amalgamation of different sci-fi stories and Han Yong’s attempted execution of these plot points may naturally lead to some divided opinions amongst drama enthusiasts and sci-fi aficionados alike.

The plot takes place in a dystopian alternative-future where the earth’s water coverage has been reduced by nearly forty -percent. In an attempt to govern humanity and ration supplies, citizens are assigned a “water grade” based on a hierarchy ranking system that determines how much of the liquid they’re allowed to access. So in an attempt to resolve problems humanity attempts to look for answers ( quite literally) in the stars.

Astrobiologist Dr. Song Ji-an ( Bae Doona )is sent on a salvage mission alongside gruff soldier Han Yoon-Jae ( Gong Yoo) in order to collect samples at the deserted Balhae moon station. With both characters having their own personal motives for taking on the assigned task the duo come across some startling and horrifying secrets as they begin their mission.

Netflix’s ‘The Silent Sea’ origins were admittedly still quite visionary by being based upon Han Yong’s notable short movie ‘ The Sea of Tranquillity’. Yet unlike the art-house-style influences of Yong’s original directed work, ‘ The Silent Sea’ notably markets itself to a wider audience demographic as a “ sci-fi and dystopian epic” with slow- burn mystery ; a mini-series that is likely to eagerly please and disappoint in equal measure.

The plot twists and turns that become apparent throughout ‘ The Silent Sea’ will likely divide those familiar with the sci-if genre; action sequences straight out of Ridley Scott’s ‘ Alien’, a suspenseful tone familiar to Christopher Nolan’s ‘ Interstellar’, bilingual exchanges paying an evident homage to Joss Whedon’s ‘ Firefly’( changed evidently to Korean and English ) , a key plot point nearly strikingly familiar to Jo Sung Hee’s ‘ Space Sweepers’, and an unsurprising likeliness to the water -themed 2009 British series’ ‘Doctor Who’ special ‘The Waters of Mars’, will possibly highlight the fine-line between paying homage and striking similarities to other notable works throughout the drama.

Of course whilst the familiarity of some of these plot twists does come into question when looking back at ‘ The Silent Sea’ it’s important to point out that the series does facilitate a solid pace with its revelations and twists right up till the last episode. However while the plot surprises are still interesting to some extent , ‘The Silent Sea’ could often neglect a crucial element to delivering its attempted tour de force moments: the cast and the characters.

Bae Doona and Gong Yoo are the undeniable star- attractions of the drama through their idiosyncratic performances offering a subtle touch of mystique and heartache as their onscreen counterparts.

Nevertheless given the evident potential for character depth in a series which explores the complexity of humanity, it will likely strike viewers as slightly unusual that ‘ The Silent Sea’ rarely diverged into using even initial exposition for establishing character personalities and adding a tweak of depth to their seemingly profound egocentric motives . Whilst later episodes place a quintessential limelight upon the characters’ roles to play in the events of the series and plot-drive, without baseline personalities ( aside from Doctor Song), notable main and important characters in the series could often slightly shallow and uninteresting .

The design of ‘The Silent Sea‘’s “ advanced” technological world and the cinematography are decent enough during viewings. There is an undeniable high reliance on CGI throughout the filming of the series; not out of the question for a series set in space, but also leading to some heavy artistic licensing by Han Yong. ( Astrophysicists, engineers and science experts may want to look away from these scenes as the logic is often devoid during these scenes .) The established setting is also not too preposterous for audiences ; several holographic displays subtly reminding the audience that this is series is set in the near-future every so often but admittedly not quite being awe-inspiring either.

‘The Silent Sea’ delivered a promising sci-fi mystery epic that brought together a myriad of sci-fi plot point twists to an original concept. With that said the series felt as though it could’ve had more episodes in order to actually flesh-out characters and the world-building of the series , leading to a mixture of mixed-reception with the final production. Viewers looking for a quick binge-watch investment with some familiar faces along the way may revel in the series’ end result . However fans of the sci-fi genre may be slightly disappointed by Netflix’s s high- budget extravaganza which whilst satisfactory for the most part did lack more of an impactful punch.

Eerie feelings wrapped inside a thriller
I think this one is the best non-romance drama of 2021.

The story revolves around sort of post apocalyptic world where water shortage has lead to it's commercialisation similar to cancer meds (maybe more chronic than it). To find new avenue of water countries are making ventures into outer space. Bae Doona and Gong Yoo are part of one of such mission.

The space station shown is very realistic. Side characters including Lee Joon don't shine that much. Their roles are rudimentary. Barring OST, everything else is perfect.

would have been better as a movie than an 8 episode drama


""below average"". ""underwhelming"".

LOL. these are the sentiments in the review after finale episode i read that i totally agree with.

i typically don't do well with Netflix shows that are about half the length of a normal full length k-drama, plus they tend to spend big on aesthetics rather than telling a well developed, coherent story. something i noticed in Sweet Home.

i could be rooting for Dr. Song's character because she's nice to LUNA and she made her feel safe in her presence and protected her, but her character has been a little too bland for my liking to be honest. i liked the female Dr's character Dr. Hong better because her personality was definitely more interesting LMAO. evident the moment she teased out the other crews the moment they were aboard the spacecraft. a personality like that could have played a badass female captain for the mission for all i care, and that would be a really badass gender reversal role, LOL.

also i read comments on the finale episode and i seem to agree that Captain Han survived because LUNA found him being thrown out of the floods of water, and saved him. so i was glad about that, because i also thought he died. pheww

also what's the actual deal with Ryu Tae Seok? i don't get the flashbacks of him being part of the military team that killed researchers in that Balhae Station 5 years ago. and if so, how come the government allowed him to re-join this mission LOL? and he's only a Lieutenant. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!

overall so many unsatisfactory plot holes and really should have been a movie instead of an 8 episode drama. ouh i must also end with a note saying i can't wait to see this child actress Sia Kim blossom into a fine young actress soon. she has a really beautiful fresh face and she's so immensely talented.

i watched this for Gong Yoo, Bae Doona and Lee Joon but i left the drama with my impression locked only for LUNA, wow! you go girl!

A Shallow Pond
This one was easy to marathon because of its small amount of episodes, and with a duration of 45 min each, they kept even those kinda short.

The title is dope. Can't deny this, I'm a sucker for those things. And it fits, too.

As for the story... I'm always in for a nice Sci fi plot (as a writer you can let your imagination run wild and create so many things, as long as you can make them believable) and the basic idea here is indeed interesting. But when you look at every element, there sadly is nothing new. The overall story is very similar to The Expanse (some of you might be familiar with that show) and some other interstellar movies. The storyline and the characters are very stereotype and predictable. There's the team leader who wouldn't move and wants to finish the mission, the rebellious biologist, the spy and a mix of some different crew members. The politician who is a follower of capitalism and confidentiality, and a hidden third party.

The thing that annoyed me the most was the technical execution. It's set in the future, there should be a certain digital and technical progress in everything. Some things did indeed look that way, but then again there were so many things that didn't fit in. Usually I like to overlook things like that but in these kinds of shows I want to see the progress in every little detail, no matter how small it might be. I want to admire them. I want to ~feel that the story is located in the future. Not to mention the medical parts. Come on, the doc only needs one look at a patient and already knows what's wrong with him. Yeah, right...

There are things happening and decisions made that seem weird. You want to know why they did what they did, but you don't get an exact answer.

So, with all the criticism above I couldn't decide whether the show was either too long or too short. The second half felt dragging (funny considering that it has only 8 eps in total), yet I wish they would have added more episodes to explain every single puzzle in more detail.

The inaccuracies turned The Silent Sea into a shallow pond.

I do praise the cast, they at least did a fantastic job with an otherwise lacking script. Some extra points for them, the cinematography and the idea. This doesn't mean it was a complete failure though. It had its good parts as well, I did enjoy certain things and also completed the show.

Hit or Miss: To Be Saved or Drowned by the Unknown
I agree with one of the reviewers, felicismoon for her final review; but somehow I need to pinpoint/add some of my final thoughts for this as well. Believe me, I'm among the anticipated viewers that somehow feel like, this can be on-par along with Space Sweepers (also space-themed too, coincidentally released in the same year, early), based on my first impression of the plot synopsis and main posters; but I was wrong, from the very start.

Cons as given:

1) VISUAL FX GOES TO OLD TIMES (literally)

since this is basically focused on outer space that I found it mildly infuriating that they tend to forget by giving attention to Earth, in detail, graphically. Early episodes are a wonderful mess that seeing those buildings in a city reminisce me back to the late 2000s to early 2010s, and the drought textures.... am I watching 90s music video? And so I researched the studio who made this drama, but out of the web browser's radar, to my dismay (even you as a viewer can easily photoshop that too with given tutorials) [watch back and pause as evidence. screenshot too if you want]

*as for the intro sequence, mayhaps Netflix nailed the job to explain the drama summary in one whole video. Correct me if I'm wrong by stating which graphic studio that did so, because they did an intro sequence for Hellbound as well, and I genuinely love that too, that leaves me hauntingly wonderful.

and don't make me compare to Space Sweepers' overall top-notch visual effects; you can (barely) see the differences either

2) PLOTHOLES

as some suggested, there should be a side story/prequel of how it has to have happened from the water itself. And Luna, too (just a picture, then the progression; no backstory, ouch). And also from me: lack backstory of how the drought even started, and that Director Choi's backstory. The direction for the storylines is pretty much complex (bear me, I'm alright with throwbacks in-between from each episode, but I genuinely don't understand, visually, for some lines from their interpretations). Other plotholes have been explained from her, so I don't need to recount

The only pros I can point these out is that yes, the stellar casts save this drama. Not instead of main casts, the supporting/cameo casts too (Kim Sia... she left me wow on this one). All of them, so I'm totally agreed with this stance. Thanks to their marvelous immersion in acting, overall the drama is pretty decent. So does for the BGM or OST if I missed out. Hence, the final rating of this review (a little high than her, because again; the casts made the job well done)

This is why everyone needs lab safety training
This drama definitely had a bunch of people making bad decisions about lab safety. (Not to mention ethics, but we're setting those aside because the moon has no ethics board, so it's fine.) I was constantly torn between yelling PUT ON YOUR HELMET at everyone as they wandered around the station and the knowledge that if Gong Yoo put on his helmet, I would not be able to see him and his neck tattoo as well. I would like to thank whoever is responsible for that character detail. He and Bae Doona were great together, especially as the show went on, but I enjoyed the cast in general!

After an episode or two, I got really worried that the whole drama was going to be basically the plot of the Doctor Who episode ""The Waters of Mars"", but thankfully, it was not! It did feel predictable at times, but I wouldn't say that in a bad way. More like it set things up rather than going for shocking ~omg it's a twist~ twists out of nowhere.

It did feel like they were setting up a few things for a potential second season, which made me sigh, but I'd consider watching it if they made one.

It’s not perfect but it’s interesting
I think the best thing in this drama is the main plot. It was interesting for me and each episode made me even more interested in what was happening. Some things were a little forced but I understand that it happens for the drama to move on. I also liked the scenery and some unpopular opinion but I didn’t find the CGI a big problem, it was ok for me.

The thing I didn’t like that much was the characters, most of them weren’t that interesting (I guess the best of them was Bae Doona’s character and maybe the doctor). I was a little disappointed in Gong Yoo’s character because ok HE’S HOT but being the leader of the team I expected him to be more charismatic idk. I liked him more later tho but still, didn’t love. Lee Joon’s character seemed lost in the beginning but he grows up in the story. I didn’t love him either but he was pretty good in the role. The others characters weren’t that interesting for me or were annoying. I think that a drama with 8 episodes (45/50 min each one) was too little to develop that much of characters.

Still, I recommend this one if u want something different from usual kdramas and if u are looking for something short and interesting to watch. It’s an immersive drama :)

Too many gaps ...
The series promised to be interesting, not original but interesting. Unfortunately it had more and more gaps in the script with each episode. Later events contradicted logic and earlier events, e. g. {{""From the dialogues it appeared that water was multiplied by living blood. Upon the death of the host, water reproduction ceased. . . ok logical. . . Suddenly in the last episode we have an ocean of water. . . . From 4 dead bodies? Another example: a captain locked in a lock where he is flooded by water. Then, after being pressurized by the ever-increasing water level (no one knows from where), water flows out of the space station and automatically freezes. . . . Meanwhile, in the final scene, our captain. . . suddenly he's leaning against the moon rocks? How?}} So I'm deluded. . .
Nevertheless, I liked the acting . :)

I was floating
I finished ""The Silent Sea"" and I cried so badly. BEST KOREAN DRAMA OF 2021. Must watch! Humans have ruined earth and now have set to ruin the moon too. Episodes 1 to 8, will keep you floating. The Silent Sea. Long ago, Galileo thought it was all water. That's what he decided to name it the Silent Sea. But once we go to the moon, there was no water. Bae Doona, Gong Yoo, and the whole cast did a great job. The music is amazing. The directing and writing are so good. The whole concept of finding water on Moon, Earth running out of water, Capitalizing water and etc, Is just so realistic as years are passing!

A good try
I'll start by saying I thoroughly enjoyed this despite it's ever more obvious flaws.

The first few episodes work pretty well - it's a bit too quick in places and has some jarring switches in pace but the cast and the effort they put into the setting pull you through.
The initial foray into the Lunar complex and the rising tensions between the characters are probably some of the strongest and best parts of the whole drama. Aided by some strong performances and unique characters.
Unfortunately the 'homage' to Alien amongst others and the risible main elements of the plot don't mesh well. This some fairly pointless twists and revelations starts to chip away at the foundation that was laid so well. Some terrible CGI takes things down further and the Oh So Inevitable betrayals and bizarrely foolish decisions by characters really pull things down.
The ending is unfortunately muddled and rushed to the point of loosing a great deal of the dramatic tension it initially promised.
It could have been so much more, a more consistent first half, maybe even a longer wait for the 'why we are really here' reveal. A more convincing Alien Thing (sorry hard to say without spoilers) better cgi a decision to go with the slow dark tension or the action horror or rather than pay homage to Alien to learn how to mesh the two from it.


Still some fine actors and a whole hearted attempt to do Sci-Fi kept me watching. I appreciated the effort put in and the little things they attempted - no eye candy here - lots of space suits and lab coats though. enjoyable but probably not rewatchable. I should really rate it lower but I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi and I did watch it all.

A moment of silence for that spectacularly bland ending
Like many recent big budget Korean shows trying to capitalize on the Hallyu wave, The Silent Sea suffers from unrealised potential. There is nothing spectacular about the show except for its cast, budget and cinematography which would have been perfectly fine. There are many shows that are well received by viewers even when these are the only three strengths of the show. So what set Silent Sea apart?

Overall:
The pacing is slow and the camera pans quite a lot in the initial episodes to show us the scenery which is exquisite BTW. There are some beautiful scenes and some real fast shots during the action sequences. All good till here.

There were few indications from the beginning though. A lot of unanswered questions. Dialogues that went nowhere. Some illogical & impossible sequences but these are all not a major turn offs. The stellar cast and great acting by Bae Doona and the rest of the actors was a big draw. The musical score did not intrude on the scenes too much. The plot was also okay, or else we wouldn't be here watching it in the first place. The show was on the right track till episode 6 with minor veering and thats when it lost its marbles.

The unnecessary segues, the wasted scenes where they tried to drag out emotions instead of having scenes that would attempt to logically introduce some of the subsequent illogical actions of the crew and the open threads really bogged down this show.

The Silent Sea could have been salvaged if it was only the last episode that sucked but unfortunately as it was the entire ending sequence which spans two entire episodes in an 8 episode show, it left me with disappointment and dissatisfaction. These two -dis words unfortunately are the last two impressions you want to leave an audience with, after a show's completion and this is why a lot of people remember only the bad things about The Silent Sea.

So would I recommend this show to others? Yes, its not bad for a one time watch as long as you are okay with the wasted potential. The first six episodes were a solid 8 for me and it only goes downhill for the last two so it is tolerable to watch the beautiful cinematography and appreciate the effects. If only the ending sequence was better! A 7/10 from me.

An Excellent Drama ...!
Wow i don't know how can i express this wonderful experience which i got after watching this excellent drama. Started with less expectations, but what i thought and what i got was completely different, first of all hat's off to the makers for not revealing anything in the trailer. When i saw the trailer i thought this probably travel with the usual path of a cliche space thriller with nothing much. But i was wrong, the things happening after episode one was totally blown my mind. From there all the mysterious things that happened in there was unbelievable.

Initial attraction was definitely the wonderful cast we got here. All the actors were familiar especially one of the dream combo gong yoo and Bae Doona together in a drama, Nations one of best actor and actress sharing screen space was really curious to watch. I don't want enter into the plot. Don't read anything, you can watch trailer because there is nothing revealing in there.

The main factor was the making quality it was top notch. You will feel that your on the board with them, wonderfully captured the Moon and It's very important to make it look so real and for many reasons they succeeded in that area without any negatives.

Nothing particular about the acting you know they all are well capable actors who can do anything. It's not easy to maintain that balance till the end. But they done absolutely brilliant job to kept the people curious till the end. Coming to the finale episodes, it's even more thrilling and exciting and ended up with a really good climax.

You must watch this, Highly recommended. Don't think this is an another usual cliche space thriller. There were many more things waiting for you. Try it

Saving the human race at the cost of humanity.
Rather than a destination, The Silent Sea served me a direction with countless possibilities and roads to follow. The questions have been asked, and it’s on me to answer them for myself.

Personally speaking, I like the shows that do not tell me everything, so I can dwell on the issues myself. Which decisions were correct, which were selfish, which showed humanity and which made the character greedy - The Silent Sea leaves enough room for me to decide on my own.

The dire reality of Earth’s water supply slowly ending was quite a nice and more realistic take on a potential dystopian scenario we might face. Showing us some details on how the nations work around the problem, the inequality in water distribution - both in the case of the quantity, but also quality of water, all that created a cohesive setting that made the mission seem justified, and the risk worth taking. The more I believe the setting, the less I question life-risking decisions the characters are making.

The Silent Sea tackles the topics of social inequality, distribution of necessary resources, corporate greed and misguided decisions that were made in hopes of bettering the lives of others. How far can we go to save the human race? Are we willing to give up humanity in the process? Should we focus on the struggles of individuals when we need to save the collective? But what is collective if not a group of individuals?

Another aspect that I greatly appreciated was the contrast between the individual goals and needs of the crew and the worsening situation on the Earth. On one hand, the contrast might make the personal issues trivial, on the other hand, it showed how important it is to consider these small, seemingly insignificant issues, as they might help us make morally sound decisions.

Moving to the cast and the performances - could we ask for me? Probably not. Bae Doona and Gong Yoo truly aced their roles, presenting all the emotions and dilemmas in the most realistic and subtle way possible. All the supporting cast did their best in bringing these characters to life, and they succeeded. Big props to Lee Joon who moved on from the meme English line “you shouldn’t do that” to the whole English dialogues (obscure references only A+ would know). His performance was for sure one that surprised me the most.

Adding to the value of the show, we’ve got some aesthetic feast. The color contrast between the warm yellow tones on Earth, and cold blue shades on the moon, the space shots, the use of light and shadows - all creating a number of beautiful pictures.

While the scenes taking place on either Earth or artificial gravity were amazing, all the physics in the rest, at times felt… oof. The movement of actors in zero gravity was an obvious wire work that took away from the realism. Some CGI could have either been improved, or the scene completely removed (was that fake lion truly necessary?).

Talking about science… just try not to think about it too hard, especially closer to the ending.

Overall, I appreciated how they did not slam me in the face with the answers, but left enough info in for me to puzzle it all together. Some twists were easier to predict than others (some could have been seen from miles away), but I was highly entertained from the beginning till the end. It’s slow at times, not action packed, but that’s the type of shows I appreciate the most.

There is also one aspect of the plot that made me quite “happy”, but since it is a spoiler, I will talk about it in the comment under the review.

I thought better...
With a cast like this, including Bae Doona, Gong Yoo and Kim Sunyoung just to name a few, i thought it'd be a lot better than this.

I was aware the storyline might've not appealed to me as I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, so i started watching it just because of the cast. I can't say it was the worst drama, but there's a lot of room for improvement.

Plot: the storyline has too many plot holes and is not completely adhesive. Some things felt rushed, and some others felt as if the screenwriters spent too much time and energy on them.

Characters: the only ones who impressed me are Jian (Bae Doona's character), Dr Hong (Kim Sunyoung) positively, and Lee Joon's. The others were almost bland, especially Gong Yoo's. He had no character, no sense of leadership whatsoever and throughout the show he made some pretty illogical choices i couldn't understand, as if he wasn't a real captain.

All in all, it's not completely a waste, but it left me quite unimpressed. For starters it's not that bad, but if you're a huge sci-fi fan then you might be disappointed.

Close, but not quite...
This limited series had an interesting premise and I appreciated the strong performances, but I felt that not enough attention was paid to the characters. There wasn't any kind of relationship building. Everyone was closed off from each other and the backstories didn't go far enough to establish any kind of emotional connection to the leads.

The show started off promisingly. I loved the suspense and it kept me watching, waiting to see what secrets the team would uncover, but it doesn't go far enough to be the kind of series I would recommend to others. I feel the good performances are lost on a show that should have gone more in depth to tell the full story. Squid Game was superior in writing to this.

I like the Sci-fi genre, especially ones about abandoned space stations with dark corridors, waiting to give up their secrets. This drew me in, but sadly, didn't deliver. Now if there is a second season promising more backstory then maybe I might give it another chance, but not if they give me more of the same superficial story.

Moon has it's own darker side
The Silent Sea may not be the most prolific korean series of the year, but it does something different by jumping into an altogether different genre, diverse from regular korean dramas.

The cast, especially Gong Yoo, did a splendid job. The writing was solid and the initial couple of episodes were tightly balanced, however it got a bit sloppy at the end. I felt that there was no satisfactory conclusion to the series, leaving behind many questions which were supposed to be answered whatsoever.

That being said, I must also acknowledge that the series does not reinvent the wheel. In fact, it’s essentially a variation on the plot of a certain other space tale. Even with the weak ending, The Silent Sea is worth watching. It’s a chilling look at a future that could be closer than we think, as well as a scary story with a monster at the end of it.


My Rating : 7.5/10

What happened?
This was a drama I was so excited to see. I added it to my Netflix list as soon as I was able. I love sci-fi. With these actors, what could go wrong?

I love dramas and movies that are either exciting or, if they are slow burn, have sufficient story to justify their length. I enjoy the tension building, anticipating what is going to happen in the scene I am watching, and the excruciating can’t wait for the next episode dramas that make k-dramas so much better than the majority of similar Western shows. Unfortunately, for me, this drama lacked much of that.

I want to say that ALL of the actors bring their A game. This is some of the best acting I have seen. I have also seen comments about how the CGI is not up to the highest standard, but I feel that unless you have a $100M to spend, the CGI was just fine.

But I felt this series had two major faults that are contradictory.

Firstly, when I finished the final episode my though was “is that it? Did I miss something? What happened to the survivors?” I am still wondering what happened to the ending. It seems to be missing. Did the writers not know how to end the drama so they just stopped dead? I still have so many questions and a massively frustrating lack of answers. After all the time I spent watching this, how can the drama leave me hanging? Its as if this drama needed an extra episode to wrap everything up.

But here’s the contradiction with my last statement. The drama is also too long. With a proper ending, this would have made a truly fantastic 4hr movie. There are so many unnecessary scenes that, if they had been cut out, would have made the pace much faster, more exciting and engrossing. There were scenes in the drama that just dragged the whole pace down to a crawl, but lacked the tension to justify them. If they had been important scenes to propel the plot, answer questions or show motivations then I could understand. One character even comments that the others do not know the whole story, and then never explains what that story is. I know how that feels.

Again, the actors are not to blame. Every bit of body language, facial expression or delivery of their lines tells you that these actors are really the greatest and deserving of their status.

I understand I may be in the minority but this is just my personal feelings.

A novel space thriller with poor character portraits
I applaud Silent Sea for its story , its novelty and its production . I like productions that take a chance and this drama certainly took a chance.

The set premise is dramatically dystopian and was vividly portrayed . The water crisis was captured so vividly that I found myself thanking the powers that be that I have clean water to shower in and that water is indeed precious. When a drama can hone in on a simple but precious concept such as water and impress upon you all its complexities , beauty and ramifications then full points on story capture !

The thriller element and intrigue was plausibly engrossing to keep a captivated viewer tuning however as I watched this show , I came to the overwhelming feeling that though this drama is novel its not special . Usually , I can think of a drama when I am not watching it , musing on what a character is going to do or making up conspiracy theories in my head . However , with Silent Sea , I just dutifully tuned and amicably forgot about it throughout my day.

I believe this is due to the character portraits of the story . The characters were not full bodied nor fleshed out . They were presented rather shallowly that it was hard to get fully behind any of them. It kinda sucked the fun out of it and the drama lost its special factor.

The cast was okay . I can't critique too much as they did not have enough fleshing out for the actors to truly shine. However, I found Bae Doona extremely one dimensional and very annoying with her stares and frequent consternation looks. The director really directed her badly as I know she is quite a capable actress.

As for the music - quite sublime !

Overall- I would highly suggest this drama if you are a fan of sci fi and the like . You will have the patience to watch and be fascinated by this drama. If you have other compelling reasons to watch - then also go for it , your time will not be wasted. But I can tell you that this show is no special thing . Novel ? Yes . Special ? No .

Enjoyable but forgettable
I have seen previous works of the main leads. They are both good actors. The premise sounded interesting, the CGI was nice. This is my cup of tea, even though the conecpt is pretty old and overdone. Fighting some mysterious creature/virus/alien in space, doing some mysterious, dangerous and inhuman research, a dystopian world, humans on the way to save humanity - that's not new. The whole idea about the luna water was pretty unique, though. In general I was on the edge of my seat most of the time. I binged it in one day. Still the plot felt empty. Many things didn't make sense. At the end I was wondering what did I even watch? There was no real conclusion. It's the kind of space survival movie, where most of the crew doesn't make it. Despite the whole series being rather pointless and forgettable (also a bit depressing), it was an interesting watch, and worth my time.

Painfully slow...
A new and amazing story with talented cast, beautiful background music and stunnning vfx.
This drama had potential except it failed for me.
The scenes were quite slow it's as if taking a leaf out of movies like Interstellar but there is a comparative difference. While (let's say as an example) Interstellar had slow scenes but actions were immediate. The slowness of scenes did not coincide with the decision-making of characters.
On the other hand, Silent Sea had characters making painfully slow decisions ending in my irritation.
Also the last episode really had me biting off my hand as my nails were already a goner.
This drama seriously tipped my anxiety off and not in a yielding manner.

Good Enough
Korean Drama ""The Silent Sea"" is a decent attempt to create a post-apocalyptic drama with loads of suspense and thriller factors.

And for sure, the drama keeps things edgy and suspenseful till the very last minute. The viewer is thrown straight away into the action, with the earth struggling to find water to support the needs of the population, and a scientist is forced to leave the planet. And there is a nudging feeling that something is off right up when the team lands on the moon and goes into the base. That feeling is maintained all throughout the story. In addition, the mystery that is formed and solved is well constructed, well presented, and perfectly paced. It gives small cheese bites throughout the episodes, and it concludes everything nicely in the final one.

However, the drama leaves a lot of things out. The condition of the earth and the dystopian current situation is not well explained and just given as a fact rather than something that needs more exploration. The characters are also the losers of the mystery-thriller focused story. There are some flashbacks that indicate some short of past and personalities, but other than those, the characters are left as blank ones that were acting on based on their initial introductions. The CGI, moreover, were bad and almost ruined the atmosphere of the drama at times.

On the other hand, the performances were top notch, as expected by top tier actors and actresses.

So, overall, 7.5 out of 10.

The Silent Wash
Look, maybe I'm too harsh on this in the title but disappointment after a pretty good set up was just too much. So let me start with the good:

The drama is set in the future where water shortage is killing life on Earth. The hope for reversal may come from the top secret discovery - lunar water - but there's a really good twist. The lunar water infects and kills the host by overwhelming his body with water so that the host drowns from the inside. Scary eh? You either die of thirst (Earth) or of self-drowning cause even your blood turns into water. I really liked this dichotomy of drought and drowning, the presumed solution to the problem that turn just as deadly in a really ironic way.

Special effects and sets were good - Netflix money delivers - and cannot say anything negative about acting though characters were seriously lacking. More about that in a second.

The bad:

After the good twist, comes the bad twist or bad trope. Or both. To control the lunar water, heroes need a savior and she appears in the form of a hybrid human/lunar water girl who, like all Star Child cliches, is faster, stronger, smarter, has self-healing powers, can breathe in Moon (lack of) atmosphere, doesn't feel cold, is basically indestructible. Short version: Total B movie rubbish. Shorter version: hogwash. Shortest version: wash. So no, the title of this review wasn't too harsh after all.

Once this trope entered the fray, predictability ensued. Of course that she's a product of cruel and forbidden experiments on 70+ other girl clones. Of course that characters who shouldn't have died die to protect her. Of course that she creates mother/daughter bond with FL and becomes FL's top priority, etc. All that stretched in 8 episodes. The whole thing could have been a solid 2 hrs long movie. At 8 x 1 hr episode, it became a chore.

There's no one that you could call a character. Po-faced actors served only as plot-forwarders, moving from A to B to C. By the end, we didn't know these characters, just who did what, and some background information such as that so and so had a sick daughter which was info dump not a characterization.

Overall, Netflix money + cast boasting Gong Yoo and Bae Doo Na should've had a better, tighter, and most importantly, inventive script. Instead, we got prettily produced but lazy and lifeless B drama void of anything that makes B cinema entertaining.

Science and Astronauts will be crying.
I was eagerly waiting for this series and it disappointed me so much.
This series had a lot of budget that went into making it, yet the script writer, nor the director didn't even think of consulting some professional who can help them in aspect of spacecraft and moon since this is a sci-fi genre, but I guess the writer and the director decided to trust their own brains that doesn't have a clue about it. Not just science sucked at every episodes, the camera work, the dialogues also brilliantly sucked.

SPOILERS AHEAD...BE WARNED.

The series starts with FL and our ML along with other crew members set out to voyage to the abandoned Balhae moon station, where 117 researchers died five years earlier. Their goal is to retrieve some mysterious sample from that moon station and return back. At this point I was ok, but then the tragedy of this series began.

The FL, ML and their crew are ready to go to the moon without even having at least a few weeks of simulation training. It is so ridiculous that our FL is shown struggling to put on her seat belt because she doesn't know while she is about to go into the space in next few seconds. I mean what the hell is that. Just when you get over this absurdity another one immediately gets thrown into your face.

Just few minutes before launching off the earth, all of a sudden one of the pilot of the spacecraft gets changed. Going to moon itself is a complex mission, yet last minute they change the pilot as if it is as easy as changing driver for your car.

I kept my patience and positivity even after this. Then comes another blow, where apparently now our team took off the earth by blasting 1, 2,3 and is going on their way to moon. And apparently their spacecraft is loosely bolted to the docking machine. I cannot believe this is the reason they come up with, you can go with many internal problems to show why you should take emergency landing but they took the impossible never happening loose bolt as a reason. And the worst thing is, because of loose bolt they can't communicate to the space center crew on the earth. How does loose bolt will lead to communication system damage???

And mind these mistakes are only half of the mistakes from first episode, I could fill pages with just first episode itself. I could have let the science mistakes slide if this drama didn't have budget, but it had. It had everything to make this show proper, but they didn't. The laziness and haughtiness could be seen in the direction. The camera work is done so worst that expect for FL, ML, you cannot properly have other characters fit into the frame with clarity.

And dialogues, omg, they talk like some kind of street business men. I don't expect astronauts to never talk slang or use profanity or talk normally, they do but still you get a sense of knowledge and professional aura even when they speak in a informal way. But this one has dialogues that seem so bland, over the top, like a frosting served without a cake.
At one point, one of the side character astronaut literally says ""can I remove my space helmet, is it safe"" when literally in front of him two people opened their helmets seemingly fine and what kind of writing that makes astronaut so stupid that he doesn't even know if it is safe to remove his helmet or not.

I cannot watch a show that makes blunders after blunders, and think everyone will be ok with it because the characters belong to A list actors.

Anyone in replies will try to oppose me or criticize me go ahead. I cannot stop you, but I stand true to my review.

I will watch anything Bae Doo Na comes up with.
The Silent Sea was definitely worth it.
I'm telling you I binge-watched the last four episodes, something I NEVER do because I'm a lazy slow watcher.
Acting was on point and so was the budget! Like, I couldn't believe it. I wonder how much money was spent on this production. Truly impressive, as a fan of anything Sci-Fi-ish.
The only reason I'm giving this a 9.5 is because WTF with that ending. It could have been better. Netflix's obsessed with those open & meaningless endings... but anyways. Still a good watch.

Good Sci Fi Drama
okay so when i started and within a jiffy first scene gone n we are in some meeting room where all characters are seated.. each epi gave me chills and yes every epi is worth watching.
but u need to watch epi 1 carefully because starting scene is literally important and if u gona miss it u wont understand the ending..!! this exactly happened with me n after ending i had to watch epi 1 again to understand what exactly i missed..
over all every actor performed so well

its a future based sci fi drama so u have to ignore any loopholes right?? it was totally a sci fi drama no needed romantic scenes either any bold scene...

Interesting plot, amazing CG as ever but it's kind of a bit of a let down.
I feel like this series has an interesting story. The situation that led the characters to space is quite convincing and at the same time it makes you wonder how will the whole thing turn out. However, throughout the series I felt like this could've been better if it was just a movie rather than a series. In most episodes, I felt like there were a lot of things that didn't really matter and felt like a futile attempt to add depth to the story. Another thing is that there's not much of a 'chemistry' among the crews. It definitely felt like they will start killing each other from the start.

Rants aside, there were several things that I liked about this series though such as:
- The premise of the story about scarcity of water that led people to make researches to find an alternative. I really find it interesting because I love anything science. (I am not a producer/writer but I feel like the whole story would've been a lot better if they focused on finding the solution rather than focusing on digging the past, attempt to monopolize the solution, betrayals, etc.)
- The amazing CGIs. I cannot imagine how long does the editing for each episode was done and how meticulous the set was made. It is definitely worth commending.

It might just be me because I had high expectations after watching Space Sweepers so I was kind of expecting the same 'wow' factor however The Silent Sea falls a little short on that. I still recommend this if you're fan of space sci-fi or Gong Yoo Ahjussi.

Great Concept, OK drama
An interesting sci-fi concept that caught my interest on first sight. Fantastic special effects and good acting are the high points. Production can't be praised enough. Had the thrill for most part but felt like something was still missing.

8 episodes were short the way it was handled, started off a bit slow, the ending was a bit anti-climatic and they left quite a few stuff to yet be resolved. Sure there are a few logical flaws but unless you are adequately informed in this area it shouldn't bother you.

Pretty solid but lacking in depth

It’s going to be a difficult one. We’ve been fed rumours, we’ve heard gossip, but the release date of The Silent Sea was postponed since the beginning of 2021 and made me question if we’ll really going to finally see it. Finally in December we’ve got what we’ve waited for. The big title featuring big names like Gong Yoo and Bae Do Na. And yet, there was barely any hype for this drama. Netflix showed maybe two promotional photos and trailer and that was it. It was all pretty much a mystery.
I was expecting a great show, really. With this cast, with an interesting idea, I thought that this will be drama to perfectly close 2021. Perfect Christmas gift. And I was waiting with this review for two months. Not because I’m lazy (ok, also that) but to be honest, I barely had anything much to say about it. But it must be done.

So, the story is pretty simple and a bit shallow maybe in how it’s not showed to the fullest. In the future humanity is faced with a big water crisis. Water is hard to come by and needs to be rationed. The amount of water that a person can get depends on the social status. The only hope lays in failed search mission on the moon. Rumour has it that in the closed off research station there’s a sample that can end the crisis. The problem is that station was closed due to radiation incident. A crew is assembled that will go to the moon and try to search for the lost sample. It will soon turn out that the information about the incident that they were given are not entirely true.

So, first of all, the background. Or lack of thereof. I know that it was probably done on purpose. Since we’ve closely followed only crew on the moon, we didn’t get much of the background. Just some slight retrospection of the characters. And I’ve wanted to know more so much. To know the characters more, to know their motivations and why are they there. How is humanity coping with the crisis? What happened that it’s so severe? We’ve got answer to none of those questions and it really irked me while watching it.

And everything is covered with thick veil of mystery. And not only to the viewer. Upon arriving in the station, our crew discovers that they don’t even have a map of the whole station. Some of it’s parts are unknown and the members cannot reach them. Which obviously, makes their search mission much more difficult. The lighting is very limited, frames very narrow which ads to the claustrophobic feeling of the series. The viewer feels locked out together with the characters on the station. Especially that there’s barely any soundtrack here and lighting is very natural so it’s easy to feel trapped.

Speaking about characters. We’ll wait a long time until we’ll get to know them better or actually at all. Since we don’t have a lot of retrospection all we can work with is what’s happening right now. We don’t get much exposition, so characters are mostly a mystery for us. We’re left with questions and speculation about what pushed those people to take part in this risky mission. But it all fits together perfectly. This drama just simply doesn’t give us simple answers.

I need to say a good word about scenography. It all looks very solid and very real, which in drama that takes place practically only indoors, is crucial and took great part in creating eerie feeling to the drama.

The action is pretty slow, but that’s how it’s supposed to be. The viewer is suspended in constant feeling of pressure. We don’t know what lures behind next door of the station, but from what we can see, it cannot be anything good.

It’s hard for me to somehow review this drama. It’s coldness and lack of emotional engagement made it difficult to perceive. Well written plot and overall amazingly created atmosphere of the drama were in plus but still left me wanting some more.

Skip It
Listen, some of my favorite actors are in the show and not even they can save terrible, terrible, terrible writing. They're doing the best they can, but my big takeaway from this debacle is that Korea doesn't understand Science Fiction and should under no circumstances attempt it again until someone who does get it, can actually write it.

I have so many (spoiler free) questions:

Why let people just walk around a space station by themselves when they have made A Discovery in the first two episodes?
Why doesn't anyone seem to care about the crew?
Are they there to figure things out or just mope?
Maybe wear protective gear when doing XXXXXX???
Maybe wear protective gear after XXXXX happens???
Do any of you have an ounce of common sense?!

Gripping
Very apt, relevant and thought provoking.
The mysteries surrounding what happened in the research station on the moon, who was responsible and more, are shockingly brought to light.
It really is gripping stuff and in the slightly claustrophobic, creepy environment, everyone is on edge. The different personalities of the crew and their strengths/weaknesses become apparent.
It is very rarely light hearted, can be shocking and gory, and the ending might disappoint some, but I thought it was fitting and so good.
I felt it was as much about portraying a warning of sorts, as telling a neatly packaged story.
Great cast; I loved Gong Yoo's cool, level-headed and accomplished Capitan figure. Typical military achiever who unquestioningly follows orders. Events see his character grow, however, and his view of Bae Doona's Scientist, changes too.
She is great ~ as always, and created a believable, detached (but for a reason), yet compassionate, strong and stubborn personality, who is brave and not afraid to ask questions.
I was so happy to see Lee Joon back in drama. He can play a range of characters and I feel is a little underrated. Very much enjoyed his acting and character in this. He had me!
The mission was riddled with problems from the start and I could not help but make guesses about characters, almost from the beginning.
It was a solid story, but some aspects raised questions about 'how'.
Also, if there was an abandoned research station on another planet, that might carry the answer to saving our earth, one would think it would be guarded by those that set it up. Satellites would surely pick up any other space craft heading its way.
If an operation were so hush-hush, crew would surely be searched (regardless of reputation etc) before setting off.
Strangely, I can't really place the music now. Maybe that is a good thing, as it means it never 'got in the way' or spoiled my viewing.
Sci-Fi aside, the catastrophe of earth drying up could one day be a reality. I'm relieved I won't see it.

Worth a watch
I went into this series with little to no expectations - i hadn't seen any reviews, trailers or descriptions, all I knew was that Gong Yoo and Bae Doona were in it so i gave it a shot.
I was quite confused after finishing the series why some were saying it was awful, granted it was not the best series of the year but it wasn't bad.
I'm going to start with the positives - the cinematography and soundtrack were astounding, it is worth to watch the show just for that. The cast and characters were overall very good.
Most negative reviews said the characters in the show made irrational decisions, which i can agree with - there were moments where i was screaming at the screen. One of them was when Dr.Song didn't answer her sisters phone call and the other one was when they were trying to escape the station and they stopped all the time to have these conversations with Ryu.
I was also left with a lot of questions but not a lot of answers - how did luna survive all this time, did the captain really die at the end, what really happened at the space station all those years ago.
Overall, this series is worth a watch if you like sci-fi and horror.

A SciFi beautifully done with enough realistic touch to make it scary believable.
A SciFi beautifully done with enough realistic touch to make it scary believable.

The reality is that the world would eventually die if we do nothing to take care of it, in this series, it's the lack of water..

Then enter the SciFi part, searching for solution and finding it on the face of the moon. The creator of the show did a really good job in showcasing human nature's innate sense of self preservation. The day to day challenge of doing what's morally acceptable, all in the name of the greater good..

The only thing lacking with this show is a bit love story, to add a bit heart or warmth to the show. It is a bit too dark, only a bit of hope was shown at the last few minutes of the show.

Reminds me of the 2013 ""Gravity"" film
In recent times there were only two space-related dramas that were made. Song Joong Ki's space sweepers film and this. Both of them are memorable and the production is excellent.

The story, production, directing, casting, acting (you name it), it's excellent. Absolutely a beautiful story and I WANT MORE!!!! I heard that there were bad reviews for this drama, BUT WHY??!! this is soo daamn good.

The story had me engaged until the very end. This drama kind of reminds me of the 2013 ""Gravity"" film. Of course, the storyline is different but the quality of the two is quite similar plus the vibe.

Anyway, This is something I recommend 100% to anyone willing to watch.

In the future, water has become a scarce and sought-after commodity, and ever larger parts of the earth are threatened with becoming a desert. But what can you do about it? ""The Silent Sea"" takes us on a mission to an abandoned moon base, where the solution is supposed to wait for the end of the earth. The basic idea is interesting, but the series itself is only to a limited extent. There is a lack of ideas as to how a longer story can be made out of the material, which is why everything here has been artificially drawn out. And you don't have to be satisfied with much when it comes to optics.

Interesting twists and well casted
This drama start off pretty mediocre having not much interesting happen during the first episode, not really reeling in the viewers, but as the story unfolds it becomes more and more interesting and less and less predictable leaving each episode with the feeling of wanting more, and not having the slightest idea of what is to come, ok some parts where a bit predictable, like pateley order of death but the rest seemed to literally jump out of nowhere. Keeping me on my toes from episode 2 and on.

The story is certainly interesting to watch and had my otherwise heard to get to watch dramas husband taking initiative to both start watching after we left off and keep going in to the night.

The cast here is plain brilliant, all do their job well, the characters are over all well written, no one is just there as comic annoying type comic relief. The main characters are complex beings allowed to show both a tough and soft side to them making them more human. There is a slight mix of issues, cuteness, ethics, politics, and dooms day feel to it mostly well balanced adding to the plot without making it too confusing (with a few side steps but they are forgivable) . The cinematography is also beautifully done. but I must warn you there are some pretty grose scenes as well...

So all in all this drama worth a watch for those who want to be kept on their toes while enjoying some pretty good acting and visuals.

Amazing sci-fi series
I started watching this series because it kept appearing on the Netflix home; partly out of curiosity and partly because I didn't have other series to see, I started the first episode... I couldn't get away from the screen.
I really like both series and movies that deal with space, science fiction, mysteries, but no one has ever taken me so much. The story is very well written, I don't think I can find places where the story falls or becomes boring. The twists are very interesting and the characters are amazing, especially Han, one of the protagonists.
I find that the result is nothing short of exceptional, I really wish there was a sequel to find some characters but the story is over and also with a satisfying ending.
Highly recommended for all those passionate about the genre and who want to see something engaging.

The Silent Sea is Binge worthy
Lee Joon is phenomenal in this drama. Also the storyline is probable and interesting, although the end is predictable to some extent. Great production. Believable story, with lots of suspense and guessing of who on the crew is a bad person. Visuals are really well done too; the moon scape. In some spots there was too much time spent on characters roaming around. It was done to create suspense, but felt more like a time filler. There was good character development for some of them and backstory was just enough without getting annoying. It's not a 10/10 for me, because there were some VERY cheesy gore/thriller moments that could've been done better. Also I wish we knew a little more about some of the characters, like the one played by Lee Joon. However it's a great watch and I binged it!

this would've been much better as a movie
tbh this would've been much better as a movie

I heard that this was supposedly a movie but Netflix or idk who insisted it is made as a series instead. nevertheless, it has amazing casting, acting, and cinematography, bae doona + gong yoo (never thought I'd need these two in one screen) the CGI is pretty good, not amazing but also not terrible.

also, why does lee Joon always have to be a villain *sighs* but I agree he's perfect for the role + luna is so pretty and cute!!!

overall, for a Netflix kdrama show, this was pretty good, it has slow pacing but is not boring. So, if you are a Sci-fi lover and if you're okay w/slow burn dramas. then I'd say watch this show.

At the end of the day, it'll all comes down to personal preference whether you'll like it or not. and for me, I actually like it, not my favorite but I like it bcs it's so different from the other kdramas which is enough for me to get my interest to watch it.

Addicting Scifi Mystery
The Silent Sea was incredibly addicting. I watched the entire thing in two sittings, and if it wasn't so late at night when I first started I would have easily watched it all without getting up from my couch. I adore science fiction and I found the overall premise of The Silent Sea very unique to the genre. While some may feel the plot was too slow, I felt 8 episodes was an ideal length of time to develop the story, characters, and the atmosphere on the moon base. The cast was a solid 10/10, with Bae Doona and Gong Yoo delivering fantastic performances in the main roles of Doctor Song and Captain Han.

While I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the first episode could be seen as a turnoff for some viewers due to the somewhat less than desirable special effects and some strange and awkward choices in the script/directing. However, I do encourage getting through the first episode as the rest of the show is a really outstanding piece of science fiction. I very much recommend this to anyone who loves a space thriller, or those who enjoyed solving a mystery along with the characters.

The Silent Sea
Mankind landed on moon in 1969.. and still many countries are sending Lunar Missions. One of the main reasons behind these expeditions is the search of Water on Moon.

The time is 2075.. water gas dried up on Earth. Humanity is suffering due to lack of water. Humans are divided into classes for Water distribution.

The Different Space Agencies have set up Stations on Moon and Mars to search for water. Here the story starts.

The Balhae Station was established to research Lunar Water. A terrible incident happened and all of the crew were dead.

After 5 years one team was sent there to retrieve the lunar water. They face the same incident. They also came into contact with LUNA, the only survivor of Balhae Incident.

Another team called RX tried to steal the Lunar Water also. Now will the te succesful or they will perish? To know the answer We have to see the drama.

The Performance of the Cast is amazing.. the VFX, the soundtrack is very good. The Natural Scenes of Moon is so beautifully depicted that it doesn't seem to be made artificially. All the episodes are great.

The Ending is an Open ending. They can return for another season to tell us how they will control Lunar Water and How LUNA helps them to do it.

I came away stunned from just seeing a great script and actors
Usually these 'types' of films are not my cup of tea however, since it was such a great cast I thought it wouldn't hurt to check it out, and I did! thank goodness. WOW what a brilliant script! The whole thing was believable and so many surprises in it. I remember thinking 'how brilliant the writer/s to come up with such a great story. The actors delivered every time and I never moved till it finished. I found myself with my jaw dropped and shocked that it was a really well done film all round.

LUNA
Story:
This is as original as it gets, and relate that to one of earth's top 10 foreseen problem in the coming future.
never been thrilled in doubting when taking water ever again after this mini series. It covers humanity dark side after exhausting the earth natural resources. 60% is made of water, Does everyone if it even LUNA exist today? you have a lot of questions after the series and the story just focused on the one thing and keeps the audience in their seats while focusing on one plot. no other side stories, a sign of a very good movie.

Power House Cast

Music
Fits with the lunar effect of the scenes

Re-watch
It is very useful as a use case, we know this is a fiction however some fictional scripts came through over the years
example is FLU movie, the script was around 2004, however the world experienced flu like scenario after 16 years

Overall
One of the few very good story, script release in the past few years.
