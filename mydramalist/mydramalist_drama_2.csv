Super love this series! Really one of the best!

First episode and I almost drop this one. Thought maybe black comedy isn't my cup of tea. But I went back here and to my surprise, it surpassed Secret Forest rating, which topped my list last year. I couldn't believe it! So I decided to continue watching it because I couldn't accept the fact that this show went beyond SF ratings. Lol. Lo and behold, I fell in love with this series every episode onwards. So glad I continued watching it. It deserves its spot here. And did I mention I watched this twice already? Lol.

The things that I absolutely love about this show are:
1. Plot - It really intrigued me at first. Thought it's something like Miracle in Cell No. 7. Each character has a colorful background story that adds spice to the entire plot.
2. Cast - I love them soooo much! Super love the idea that the director chose fresh faces. You know, you wouldn't know what to expect. The usual people with villain roles esp lt. Paeng became the my oh-so-loved character here. While some actors who are usually the protaganists ended as the antagonists. The chemistry among the actors is superb!

And of course, who wouldn't love Looney?!! Oh my gosh. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have continued watching this and I would have missed a lot! He played a major role in this show and I so love his banter with Kaist and Cap Yoo. He was excellent! Hope he gets more projects after this!

One more character that will be ingrained in my mind is Park Hae Soo. I've been with kdrama since 2003 and who?! Who was this actor that suddenly popped up and got that main role!? I love him! He's good when he acts dumb, but when he's angry or hurt, he has effectively delivered those emotions. Where have you been, PHS? Lol. So love his bromance with JKH. JKH is, of course, in no doubt owned his role.

Lots of love for this drama. I still have so much to say but you people just watch it for yourself! Lol!

Spectacular
When I saw the title of the drama series. I thought it was so serious and the story lines might be more about serious crimes. But when I started to watch it, it was hilarious and very funny. But then they are stories that are very touching and mostly it makes me cry. This series gives hopes and gives you full understanding of life in prison, not in very serious way. So I really enjoyed watching it... One of my favorite drama series.
Applaud for the main cast Kim Je Hyuk (Park Hae Soo) and Lee Joon Ho (Jyung Kyun Ho) who we know that the act great with their role.
But uprising star which I was enjoyed so much was ""Loony"" himself Yoo Han Yang (Lee Kyu Hyung), I really have so much fun with his character. I was laughing out loud. He makes everything so funny. And the rest of the stars I can say really enjoyed each character.

Authentic Portrayal Of Asperger's
As someone who who has been diagnosed with Asperger's herself and as a mother of a son who is diagnosed the same I felt compelled to write a review for this drama. Tang Jung Sang is simply amazing and very authentic in the part of Gu Ru. I cannot stress that enough. Some people might try to disagree with me, but you have to understand, we all have different traits that manifest. Though I, as a female Aspie am totally different than Gu Ru, I still could relate to many traits that the character had and how they were acted out. My son is a lot more similar, though not as extreme, but he also has had professional therapy and has been raised by a mother who is also an Aspie. In the drama, it is shown that Gu Ru's father was the one who worked with him throughout his life, so of course he would still have many issues, though his father did such a a wonderful job just by accepting him and loving him for he is and teaching him. Honestly, the simple teachings his father gave to him were so very similar to how I have taught my son. His father was not autistic but still. He just knew how to get through to Gu Ru in such a patient, loving way. I mean, it is such a simple approach, how he shown doing things, but it is always the *right* way. That is exactly how parents of autistic children should communicate. I saw so many traits, however, that my son had when younger, before the years of therapy began. (Not ABA. I just want to make that clear before anyone jumps on me. I am talking social skills.) For instance, as a child, my son, like Gu Ru, would talk robotically and stim much more when overwhelmed. Also, he still walks very stiffly and won't make eye contact at all.

Another thing that I must point out is very authentic is his ability to memorize what he sees. In my case, I cannot in the way he does, but I can memorize an accent if I hear it once and determine where the person speaking is from. My son can memorize languages and mathmatical concepts. Again, our traits, while similar, can manifest differently.

A number of shows and dramas have been coming out lately that make autism the focal point. I haven't seen all of them, but Move To Heaven nails it. I can also vouch because even though I have explained my and my son's differences to Gu Ru, I know quite a few just like him. In fact, while watching, it is easy to think Tang Jung Sang actually has Asperger's, he is that good at acting it out.

Anyway, on to the rest.

The story is heartwrenching in so many ways, but deeply moving. The main focus is actually the relationship between Gu Ru and his long lost uncle. His uncle appears like a selfish, uncaring slob, but as the story progresses, we get to understand him more and see his heart soften for his nephew. As usual, Lee Je Hoon is excellent. He is such a great actor. He can show a range of emotions and also, just like in Taxi Driver, he kicks butt in fighting scenes.

I give this drama a 9 because it is wonderful, beautiful and doesn't screw up showing autism. I would have given it a 10 but I was kind of hoping for a certain plot twist and it didn't happen. Lol (What did happen was still good, I just really wanted the other thing. Haha!) Also, it left off with something like...not a cliffhanger but something you are left waiting to see what and if anything happens there. It was totally on purpose as an opening for a possible second season on Netflix, I just hate it when they do that when nothing is confirmed. Don't leave peeps hanging! I do hope there is a Season 2. I will watch if there is.

ART OF APPRECIATING LIFE
Move to Heaven drama is the kind of thing you need when you are desperately seeking the meaning of your life. The most important purpose of this drama is to change our perspectives about ""grieving"" to someone's demise. Every other episode has it's beautiful message to deliver. This drama portrays important issues while celebrating people's life and showing both respect and shade to ""death"". It is so very wholesome and will truly evoke your emotions. So, if you're a worshiper of ""slice of life"" dramas,this drama is for YOU.

The drama starts with someone's misery hinting a tragic journey but the entire journey is just beautiful. Saying that it will make you cry tears of happiness will be an understatement because this is one of those heart-warming Kdramas out there.

Simply, the drama consists several different stories that worked likes dots and connecting them made the drama complete. Ofc, it has its basic steady plot too which is appealing (you can read it in the synopsis).

This drama also emphasizes on how a dead can communicate with the living from what they've left behind. This particular thing have touched the core of my heart and I'm sure it's been mesmerizing for everyone too.

The write has done very well in touching different forms if life in the guise of societal issues which will definitely fuel up the positive stances and enroute acceptance in people's midsets. The direction abd screenplay is simply like adding feather to a cap. Good job in cinematography too. The crew has done a commendable job here.

Then comes the cast. I swear to my happiness, the production has done a very good job in casting, be it the major characters or the guest characters, I would say they are the appropriate choice. I was so happy seeing soooo many guest characters.

Lee Jee Hoon, definitely one of the best Korean actors has once again won our hearts with his acting, played his character really well. Tang Joon Sang, being a newbie, I am sure this drama and his acting, will bring him enormous opportunity. He's so cute and was really good in playing someone with Asperger's syndrome. I like Hong Seung Hee in Navillera (another slice of life heart-warming drama) though her screen timing was limited and here she did good too.

EVERYTHING FELT SO BEAUTIFUL.

Let's talk about the ending. Let me say you that I am not okay with it. It has an open ending hinting for a new season but is that necessary? They could have closed the drama with the scene before the last scene too but they decided to extend it with a big twist. Idk what's in the writer's mind but I am looking forward to it. I was actually wishing there'd be more episodes given that it's soooo good, but am not happy because in most of the cases the dramas with extended seasons ended up getting messed. I really really hope it won't happen with MOVE TO HEAVEN.

A touching drama criticizing society in the most beautiful way
This was an emotional ride with every singel emotion known ... I have probably cried every singel type of tear i know of.... so to say I was touched is an understatement.

This drama combines important issues while celebrating peoples life and showing both respect and nuance to peoples death. Every episode has a message and while some kick you making you want to fight back, some will give you hope and others are just sad and that is okay too.

The main story is touching on its own with, trauma, violence, misunderstandings and a whole lot of regret truly has everything and more that one can expect and wish for from this type of drama. I Love the way this drama shows people of different ability as competent humans with emotions deserving respect but also in need of assistance. I also love how this drama tackels prejudice and controversial issues in today's society in an unapologetic yet beautiful way.

I was not annoyed at any one, never had the urge to pause, the humor in it hit just the right spot and all in all I loved it. Yes I did. This does not mean every second was perfect or that every singel actors acting was flawless it just means I liked the way it woke my emotions and made me feel so many different emotions in only 10 episodes.

What also made this drama great was that different episodes where kind of different generas so there was really not time to get bored. While some episodes where more emotional, other episodes kept me on my toes, some truly caught me of guard and supersized me and some even made me fall in love... but to be clear the romance truly is kept to a minimum.

This drama also taught me that even dead people communicate, we just have to listen and observe the objects they leave behind and that as long as some one is in your memory you will never be alone... kind of creepy but sweet and comforting.

OMG I LOVE THIS SHOW
I don't usually write reviews so I'm not sure how helpful this will be but this was hands down one of the best shows I have seen. If anyone ever asked me to name a show that made me cry the most, it is this show for sure!
It is heartwarming and beautiful.
The actors did a wonderful job with their roles. You could feel their emotions and getting completely absorbed into the drama was very easy.
The story was deep and meaningful and it was executed very well. It delivers a very simple message which most of us might overlook even though it's right in front of us.
And the special appearances never hurt!

I don't mind sitting down to rewatch the drama again right now!

don't cry, craft
i'm not sure how to correctly describe this drama or if there is a right way to perfectly capture words that sums up this drama because there isn't...

this drama almost feels like a kaleidoscopic view from a newborn witnessing different walks of life and circumstances. in other words, the different stories of the deceased and main characters geu ru, jeongu and songu... they all remind the viewers of what it's like to be human in an almost raw way (even taking in real life events).

one thing i can say is this almost felt impossible to binge because of the emotional impact most of the stories had on me. perhaps the situations the characters had are so similar to real life that it ignites heavy emotions. if anything, i'd crown this as the biggest tear jerker this year so far.

overall, this drama paints different stories and portrays various point of views and delivers great emotions. this drama's title should probably be changed into ""move to tears"" because *sobs*

Worth Every Minute and Tear Dropped
This is one of the best dramas I have ever seen. It is so wholesome and heartwarming. I loved every moment of it. If you loved Miracle in Cell No.7, prepare your tissue box because this one is times ten that...ten episodes of potiential triggers for endless ugly crying.

Honestly, the acting and storyline is impeccable. Everything is paced nicely and there are thorough twists and turns to keep things interesting. You'll find yourself invested from the get-go and longing for more when you finally notice you've already hit episode ten. Truly a beautiful and thoroughly thought out drama made to pull hearts and conjure up pools of tears.

Highly Recommend -- Illuminating Journey of the Power of Love
I wasn't sure what to expect with Move to Heaven. I mean, I read the premise of it, but how many times have we all done that only to find the show or movie is nothing like the synopsis described it. One thing is for sure, though, it was quite an emotional ride, one I hadn't felt since My Mister and Chocolate. And not only that but it's beautifully produced, with vivid colors and tones. I knew I would enjoy the drama for the mere fact that Lee Je Hoon was in it, and it's the main reason I decided to watch it since it wasn't really in my plan to watch list, to begin with; I'm glad I did.

There is no disputing the brilliance that is Tang Jun Sang as Han Geu Roo. But my favorite was Hong Seung Hee in her role as Yoon Na Moo. She was a blessing to have in and around Geu Roo throughout the drama in every sense of the word. I would be remiss not to mention Jung Ae Yun in the role of Madam Jung, the one character I disliked the moment I laid eyes on her. I mean, even before she uttered a word, and it never really got any better for her, no arc development or growth here, just pure greed. But with that said, the credit again goes to Jung Ae Yun and her ability to make me feel the way I did towards her character. Each character, the good and the bad leave an impact and makes Move to Heaven the great story that slowly and methodically unfolds on screen.

Everything about this drama works and works very well. From the touching stories in each of the commissioned trauma cleanings to the way Move to Heaven handles each case and the closure, care, and respect it provides to the dearly departed as well as those left behind to deal with the loss of their loved one. I truly commend the writer, the director, all the actors for bringing to life a drama about a young man who cannot change, whose whole life is anchored and defended by routine yet changes the lives of all those around him. And by the end of the first episode, I found myself feeling love for Han Geu Roo like he was related to me, which is a credit to Tang Jung Sang as an actor and how he plays the character. He doesn't play him as cute, lovable, or even pathetic, but a matter of factly, uninflected, unmoved except when his routine changes and he gets agitated until its balance is restored. And it's in those moments that I grew to love him even more than I had already started for what he was, and realized that's how the people around him felt about him too.

All the change in the drama belongs to Jo Sang Goo (Lee Je Hoon), who begins the drama as a me-first opportunist. But by the end, he learns to pay attention, listen, and be a little more patient while in the process gets to know the meaning of family and true love. Move to Heaven to me was about acceptance, unconditional love, and that being different is nothing to be afraid of but something to encourage and embrace. And it's a lesson we can all undoubtedly benefit from in our daily dealings with the people around us, be it family, friends, our neighbors, or mere strangers. Fantastic drama, and here is me wishing and optimistically waiting on the second season of this journey.

THE WARMTH OF BEING GLOOMY
First of all I rated it with 2.0 in rewatchable value for the reason of Drama Withdrawal. How can normal people watch it again for the 2nd time, like every episode I become a mess a sobbing jellybean watching it with tissues ready on the side. For once in my life on watching kdrama this was the only drama that I would take a break for each and every episode because i cant control my eyes from watering my cheeks damn THATS HOW SAD ITS IS. Overall the drama is very good because it talks about human penury, human guilt, longingness and everything that makes us a sponge of things around us based on our actions and interactions within the society also depicts life situation of kids with disabilities which is nice approach in giving awareness. KUDOS TO THE TEAM. but I think i can rewatch it anytime soon.

Bring Tissues
Going into this, I had a lot of expectations and reservations about the show. I knew it would make me feel things, but I was also worried about how it would tackle so many delicate subjects at once. In many cases, it's not handled well. But with each episode, Move to Heaven continued to surprise and impress me.

Naturally, every episode of Move to Heaven deals with grief. Each case is unique and deals with its own circumstances surrounding the deceased and the people in their lives. The people range from every walk of life and tackle a lot of big topics that are relevant today, from the LGBT community to the problems with overseas adoption. Geu Roo's character was handled with a lot of respect, too, and he's extremely likable. I can't say whether his portrayal was accurate or realistic as I don't think I'm qualified to, but it felt very well done. His relationship with both his father and uncle was amazing to see and the way each character grows from episode 1 to episode 10 was beautiful.

It's heartbreaking. Naturally. The job of Move to Heaven is not only to clean up the deceased's belongings but to say to their loved ones what they never could. It's sad, but it's also uplifting as you watch the small impact these things can make on someone's life. I give it the highest of recommendations. Whether or not we get a season 2, it's worth your time.

my eyes are burning from all the crying.
This show has entered my all time favorite k-dramas list. TOP5!
When i tell you i've cried every single episode, i wished i was lying... but i did. If there's something that leaves me completely broken are unspoken words that didn't reach someone in life, that are later shared to the audience via memories.

Every story is different, and they are all as beautiful as they are heartbreaking. Every episode leaves lingering feelings.
This really made me think, if i died tomorrow and someone had to collect my stuff, what would they find that it's of any worth?! Will my items help to reveal who i am and help my loved ones find peace?! This show was so profound to me... i had many thoughts while watching it.

The actors are 10/10. Amazing performance. Just wow. I will recommend this kdrama even to people that don't usually watch asian content shows. It's incredible!

The only thing that it's not a 10 it's the rewatch value, cause I don't think i can make myself watch it all over again. My head hurts, my eyes are burning... this show has emotionally destroy me (in a good way. i have a feeling i have grown as a person while watching this show). I will watch a second season though. I think it's fair to say a second season will drop eventually, and i will recharge my heart and tissue box for the next round of stories.

Big thank you to the writers of this show. Thank you!

Heart wrenching
Disclaimer: I'm not the best writing reviews but I'll try my best!

""Move To Heaven"" was beautifully written! I cried every episode and each episode was heartwarming,
My favorite thing about is how the uncle and nephew got closer in each episode.

This show is such a roller coaster! My emotion would change every minute to Joy, Angry, and sad.
I highly recommend if you love emotional K-Dramas! :) It's really good like really good so watch it!

The actors were amazing doing their job! Lee Je Hoon and Tang Jun Sung was amazing portraying their characters.
I hope to see a lot from them in the future.

Everything was amazing the way there's each story in every episode is really meaningful. The director, screenwriter, producers were amazing too. If your reading this definitely check the K-Drama out!!

Trying too hard
this just tried too hard to be sad, the stories felt too convenient and after watching the same sob stories it kinda makes it less moving.
the whole dynamic of the cold guy, the dysfunctional family to the ""guardian"" that needs to change thing happens way too often, even the whole life full of misfortune that makes the ML jaded thing

but I have to say, lee je hoon's acting was amazing, he played the sad soul to the hopeful soft soul really well. a little too well cuz everyone else seemed basic.
Lee Jae Wook and the whole meeting with LJH had more depth than the story though the ending again was just another move for the tears so it felt meh, but his acting was great too
and Ji Jin Hee as well, he did the perfect father role really well


the story about Jung Woo finding the baby, and the slow building love from Sang Gu were the best parts. I also liked Choi Soo Young, I wish she had a bigger role

the ost was basic and I never rewatch stuff.

wasted potential-- a rant
I'll just say it: han geu ru is BARELY a character, let alone the MAIN one, and that makes me so mad. i won't talk about the portrayal of people with asperger's because I don't know enough about the topic, but come on, by the trailer i thought we were gonna get a show about how someone whose work revolves around death, deals with the passing of a loved one and their grieving process, but instead, from episodes 2-9, his whole role is of a plot device to help his broken uncle navigate his new job and teach him the power of family.

also, let's talk about how almost everyone treats him as a child? my guess is that he was supposed to be younger, but it would've been a hassle to fit in his school life so they just made him 20 years old. they even admit on the LAST EPISODE that we know nothing about him, and still, they told his parents' story instead. what was his life like between his mother's death and the start of the series? i don't know, find out in season 2... maybe.

still, i can't say this is a bad drama by any means. the stories about the clients are beautifully written and are heartbreaking yet inspiring. they manage to make us fall in love with them, empathize with they life journey and cry for their death in just a couple of episodes. SO WHERE WAS THIS ENERGY while writing geu ru's character?

A very emotive drama - fab acting!
I had no knowledge of this drama until a clip started playing on my Netflix home page. It looked intriguing, so I hopped on here to see what people were saying and decided to give it a try.

I am so glad I did! The drama is beautifully executed and manages to draw emotion from it’s audience with a combination of great acting and well-thought out stories, each offering the chance for the main characters to grow.

The relationship between the main characters is so unique. I love that we get to watch the characters smoothly transition from strangers to family.

I have only seen LJH in Signal, and when he appeared in the first episode, I almost didn’t recognise him. His character is so different to the one he portrays in Signal and so I’m glad I’ve got to see how versatile he is as an actor. I look forward to watching more of his dramas!

Overall, the characters in the drama are refreshing to watch. The relationships feel realistic and the plot manages to highlight different issues in society, beautifully unraveling the different stories of the deceased.

I recommend watching! It’s considerably shorter than most dramas, so it’s not a big commitment. My heart feels full after finishing this drama - I’m not sure how else to describe how I feel!

wholesome
just have to write a review for this series.

this series just brought us a new perspective of grieving. how things left behind by the deceased often portray their life and what they wanted to convey to their loved one or the world. how the series bring it to life is just touching and wholesome.

each character shown has their story to tell and it was what hook me in the most. the character development of the main lead is really good and well develop especially cho sang goo. and how han geu roo brought us to his journey of grieving and letting go of his father. these 3 character (cho sang goo, han geu roo, han jung woo) relationship with each other are really great developed and the progressed is really good.

the acting of each character is really well.

the only reason why i do not score it 5 stars for rewatch value is because i don't think i can't rewatch it on a whim, i have to prepare myself emotionally to rewatch it again because it really emotion-consuming watching this series. （i cried for the whole series, managed to used a box of tissue)

OMG! I’m crying my eyes out!
Why am I doing this to myself? A drama about people dying, so fifteen minutes into the first episode of this drama, and I’m already sobbing. This grabbed me within the first five minutes. With most dramas, I have to watch at least three episodes to get interested, but not with this one. It is a very touching, emotional, extremely well acted drama, and I hope it continues being this good.I can tell from now, I will be binge watching this one. I will now commence binging the rest of this, and update my review when I’m done. Hopefully this rating will stay a ten. So... let the binging begin...!

On episode six, and it is still a 10!

Just finished this, and I am sitting here crying. Every single episode was good, well acted, well written, emotional, everything... it had it all. I will watch it again, I’m sure several times. Judging by how it ended, I believe there will (hopefully), be a second season. There could be so much more to tell. This drama especially hits you hard if you’ve experienced the death of a loved one. Those emotions hit so close to home when you watch each episode, how the person died, how the family reacts, and the experience of discovering the deceased life, through cleaning out their belongings. One episode was particularly heart wrenching about a young man that searched for his mother his whole life. All I can say is, this is a must watch drama, that will affect you for a while after your are done.

Thanks for introducing us to this very special profession
I have huge praise for screenwriter Yoon Ji Ryun for creating a show about trauma cleaners, a profession I didn't know existed. Especially in a culture that is fairly judgemental about people's jobs and superstitious about death, it's doubly important to tell stories about it. Not only does it address trauma cleaners and humanize the dead, but it also tries to portray people with ASD as valuable, capable, and human.

The story is simple and easy to digest. Each character has one main conflict plotline that is punctuated by each encounter with a deceased person as the team cleans up their belongings and learns about their life. The simple treatment is actually why I don't think the show deserves a high overall rating. It is simply too conventional. The conflicts and challenges the characters face and their resulting transformations are too predictable. The dialogue and interactions that show character transformations, though well written and well delivered, are too perfect. The flashbacks of Geu Ru and his father are too smoothly heartwarming. I feel that this show could have taken the highly engaging material and challenged us as viewers. It could have pushed us to rethink what we already know, and asked us to question what it means to live, love, and die, what intelligence is, what family means to us, and what we are willing to sacrifice. Instead, it gives us something to pat ourselves on the back with because most of us already believe what the show is trying to tell us.

Furthermore, one big issue is the show's treatment of Geu Ru. It gets some of the mechanics right about his abilities, but exploits his character to help others learn lessons or change their thinking. I found this to be behind the times in terms of how shows should portray neurodiverse people. We hardly get to know him as a person. We don't understand his inner thoughts at all. If the year was 1980, perhaps this show would have been groundbreaking (in case you didn't know, Rain Man was released in 1988). But alas, it is 2021 and we expect better.

The acting is outstanding, especially Lee Je Hoon as our conflicted underground fighter Sang Gu. I feel he played the sensitive uncle with depth and understanding. I also really enjoyed Hong Seung Hee as Na Mu. She never overplayed her energetic character, despite the fact that her role was basically written as ""the responsible nag"". Finally, Tang Jun Sang's performance as Geu Ru was understated and he really connected with the other characters even when his character had differing goals.

I will be along for the ride next season, and I sincerely hope this show will grow and challenge us further.

Also, if you are interested in this theme, read The Embalmer, a well crafted manga by Mitsukazu Mihara, which tries to break superstitions and judgement about death and this particular way of preserving the dead.

I want to say first things first, if I cry, I automatically think the show is pretty good. Lol. And I cried every single episdoe just about. But honestly, this show was super good. I heard a lot of people read the book? I'm not aware; I kind of went into it because I saw some almost spoilers on tiktok and I'm glad I did. I'm honestly so hyped and thankful this show was out because it's a nice touch of everything from life, to relationships to love and etc. It shows the reality of life and death and having to move forward and still being stuck. It makes you feel like life isn't truly that bad but it can feel that way and some people have it worse and you're blessed. It really was an emotional rollercoaster that I kind of was truly thankful to be on.

The acting was amazing; I liked how everyone played their parts amazing.

Classical music was fitting and calming.

I think I would watch it if I need a good cry.

Overall, I definitely recommend this show; I definitely want to tell every single person I know to watch it because it really is just a master piece. Of life, death, family and even more. It all played such important parts to life in general.

Touching
Binged watched the show the day it came out. I started crying 15 min into the first episode. The amount of respect and care the characters showed while doing their work was amazing. This show gave a insight in how the aftermath of loss of life unfolds on the belongings and the place they lived in and how different people deal with it in different ways.

The series has only a few main characters and it shows that you can make a excellent story with just that. The CGIs were so cute , made it easier for us to understand the thought process of the MC. The way range of scenarios were show and carefully covered was amazing. I am so happy with the cast , that they feel perfect for this show , I wish it had more episodes but the character growth and pace was fine so , maybe a season 2 since it has so much potential.

It also beautifully show how much shame and awkwardness is attached to a person's passing that it is often translated into silence, how hush hush the affair of removing the belonging has to be. Trauma Cleaner deserve more respect.

Our priorities are so , our grief is so and passage of time is slow so complicated , that we work on listening to the person through their belongings , after they have passed and how we try to revive memories in them. A lot of unsaid and unknown unravels when someone passes and then it becomes to late for us to know that. It's a must watch series for growth and healing , for I know most of us ,definitely in lives have Not dealt with atleast one loss fully and this may helps us in a way .

Sang Goo's character development makes it worth the watch
Move to Heaven was just an okay drama for me. The plot moved at a consistently slow pace because the story for the main characters was regularly interrupted with each episode's sub-plot for the trauma cleaning service.

I was most interested in the story of the uncle, Sang Goo - his history with the cage fighting and his pupil, and then his history with his older brother, Han Geu Ru's father, were interesting to me. These curiosities were well satisfied, but I found that some of the characters were lacking - Na Moo and Yu Rim (the social worker) were the potential love interests for Geu Ru and Sang Goo, respectively, but they wasn't developed really at all. Madam Jung also wasn't caught in the end - satisfaction-wise, this was not okay for me as the viewer.
I also found the ending to be a bit frustrating - it's obviously left open because Netflix wants the possibility of a season 2, but it's ambiguity was not appreciated.

Overall, I was not expecting the kind of drama I got from Move to Heaven - the tone was much sadder than I had anticipated, especially based on teaser trailers. There weren't laugh-out-loud moments (maybe just moments that made me smile here and there?). But at the same time, I didn't actually cry with this drama, nor did my chest ache for the characters, which I'm completely surprised by...I think this story just failed to move me the way I had anticipated. It's a quick drama to watch and the character development for Sang Goo was definitely worth the watch!

This is one of the best shows I have ever watched!
I swear to god, this is one of the most emotional and best shows, I have ever watched. I cried in this show, it made my heart twinge. The feelings it evoked are too powerful, you should keep a handkerchief near you. It made me see the trauma cleaners in and entirely different light. I really respect them after watching this show. The dead are still living in our hearts once they leave this abode. The dead also have feelings and the trauma cleaners are going through pain of cleaning and eliminating the deads stuff, they end up emotional while doing the job. The director, producer, writer, actors and many more did a remarkable job on this show. One important thing I learned while watching this show is don't hold grudges against anyone, you can never know when they will depart. Just Wow. Just Wow.

With new perception comes great tears TLDR A FUKCING MASTERPIECE
May 16, 2021

HOLY FUCKING HELL, I JUST BAWLED THE FUCK OUT OF MY EYES. This show is A FUCKING MASTERPIECE AND WHEN I SAY A MASTER FUCKING PIECE. A LITERAL MASTERPIECE. This show is an eye-opener for people. The plot is well written, every episode you see new stories being told. And you can help but wonder, what new life lesson will I learn? I am so sad to say goodbye to the series, where I finally learned what it feels like to appreciate the little things in my life.

Geuru's Uncle, first of all, I just wanna say that he had the greatest character development out of all the kdramas that I have watched this year. I feel the ounce of betrayal and angst that he felt. I feel pity for the things that he lost and you can say that if he never met Geuru, he would probably living this lifestyle right now.

Nummo (is that how you spell it??) aka Geuru's neighbor friend, I just wanna say thank you to her. She is the greatest friend ever, I love everything that she does and does for Geuru and how her friendship evolved with Geuru's Uncle.

As for Geuru, THE ACTOR THAT PLAYED HIM IS SO TALENTED. I AM SEEING A HUGE POTENTIAL FOR THIS BOY. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT HE WILL HAVE A GREAT FUTURE. I will definitely miss Geuru's personality. He may be timid and only speak when he feels like he needs to. But I fucking love this kid, I will take a bullet for him to be honest.

I HOPE YOU ALL WILL WATCH AND LOVE THIS SERIES. IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT YOU WON'T EVER REGRET TO WATCH AND SURELY SOMETHING THAT WILL YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER. I HOPE YOU LEARN SOME LIFE LESSONS AS WELL AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE SERIES. BEST WISHES!!

You know those dramas that hook you with an AMAZING first 1 or 2 episodes, then either suddenly or gradually lose steam? This was one of those dramas for me. I appreciate an autistic lead, it's a very unique and appreciated premise and I believe that accounts for much of the high rating. And like I said the first episode blew me away. However the rest of the story fell pretty flat. While it was interesting for an episode or two to see the inner workings of their business cleaning up the possessions of the deceased, I did not have any emotional investment in all the lengthy side stories of the random deceased characters. It got to a point where I lost interest because they had so little to do with the main plot and characters. And then outside of that there was very little in the way of actual plot. If that sounds like your thing though you'll definitely enjoy this.

What's in your box?
Move to Heaven is a masterpiece, which I don't really say too often. I watched a lot of dramas before, and I've never seen something quite like this one. It explores complex relationship dynamics, mental health, and death on a deeper, more heartwarming level than most dramas today. I loved every bit of it. From the script to the pacing, everything had a realness from start to finish. While some episodes were more heart-wrenching than others, I found myself still tearing up during every episode. I was at episode 9 before I realized it was only 10 episodes long. It's so good.
It really makes you look around and wonder what they'd put in your box after you're gone.

What a lovely story
This review DON’T contain spoilers.

So to begin with:: THIS DRAMA IS WORTH EVERY SECOND!
It hit you everywhere.
I needed a bucket and lot of tissues.
Sooo heartwarming ❤️

The drama brings you close to each character.
You really get a kind of bonding and it hurts when a character need to say good bye.

Some story’s are really realistic.
As example: a family that won’t miss you, someone without any family or friends, real events that happens in the past ( the disaster of Sampoong building, illegal adoptions etc.)

What I liked the most are the actors and their acting skills.
They brought every character alive.
Their acting where AMAZING.
In a second you get from a smile on your face to tears or anger.
Amazing job.
And the soundtracks, love it~ 🥰
The music drag you along to the whole drama.

What I also love the most is this was a different kind of k-drama.
This time no big love triangle, product promotions, drama’s, all the usual stuff in k-drama’s.
A ML with ASS, a FL that is a good supporting friend, crazy, really kind, tuff uncle that will take your heart.
I call it a golden duo.

We need more of this kind of K-Drama.
That take you to a different perspective 🥰

1000/10

A way to honor the dead and the living in a valuable critique...
I've been anticipating for this drama ever since I saw the trailer and it blew my and everybody else minds so it seems.

Move to Heaven it is a small compilation of valuable morals, and a critique to society and the way we evaluate death, loss and our petty priorities. It also depicts the spectrum of disabilities, traumas and the morbid view of life and death.

My only critique to this drama is the fact that it only has 10 episodes of 45 minutes each, but at the same time I am equally pleased by how the plot merged with the cases and how well the characters did their roles here, it's hard to put into words, on how much I appreciate this drama, the author, the actors and production for presenting us this MASTERPIECE.

I was also really excited to see Jun Sang in a main role again after watching him be the maknae in CLOY where he did a support character although still lovable. Playing GeuRoo into only widened his range of acting skills, because he delivered a special role, portraying a character with autism and who also suffered from selective mutism in his childhood years. The way he talked and his antics only made GeuRoo who he is, a special, highly intelligent and always curious, caring boy who has is still trying to figure out life when he suffers another huge loss. They way him and his dad can perceive and try to comprehend their departing costumers by their personal belongings is really meaningful.

JeHoon is another who is on fire lately on his roles, and being an avid fan of Taxi Driver (since it's another drama of him that I am currently following), I loved seeing him in this unconventional role of SanGoo, a worn out boxer and ex-convict that feels bitter towards his life. Thinking he was abandoned by his own brother, and unfortunately responsible for ""killing"" his protégé and in a way best friend and little brother, SuCheol. Beneath that hard shell of him against the world, is that scared child that was left behind, the one that yearned for his hyung to come back for him. It's sad to know that in the end they didn't cope or got to meet to amend their broken bond. That he learned late of the truth, but still the best way he can repay and improve is by being on GeuRoo's side. The fact that he Has a development of character is really heartwarming to watch. The scene where he collects SuCheol belongings just as GeuRoo does and puts it in a box the same way as the Move to Heaven style, and discovers new things he hadn't had knowledge before was such a touching scene of the many this drama has to offer.

SeungHee as Namu served as a comical relief sometimes, with her crush on GeuRoo and her constant bickering with SanGoo.

The endless emotional stories that this little drama presented were touching and realistic accurate that can be relatable.

Not going to lie the first episode was the start of this quite unique emotional ride. Not for the faint of heart.

I have heard of this job before, Trauma Cleaners do have a tough but also rewarding job sometimes. They get to know people who leave their stories behind in their personal belongings, in their homes, scattered pieces like a puzzle waiting to be placed together. Stories of a lifetime, placed in a box of a few personal items that can tell a lot about the late person.

It made me wonder, as I looked around my own room, what my box would look like if it had my personal belongings.
As morbid as it sounds, I've come to realize that there's not many things I would see in there that could really define me.
Perhaps one or two could define me in general, however there was nothing really relevant that could be placed in a yellow box of mine. Then again maybe that's my purpose, still in this fickle path called LIFE, to find the missing pieces of my own puzzle.

Another thing I would like to point out in this drama besides the amazing realistic storyline, is without a doubt the remarkable choice of music. Not everyday where in a drama like this, Classical Music is notorious or even commended. And yet in here not only it has a wide variety of pieces, but I was pleased to see the full names of the said pieces in the credits. There were quite a few of my favorites in there too, and the scenes where they were played when GeuRoo worked and put his earphones were so deeply meaningful and it gave a certain peace to see. It might be scenes dealing with taking care of the deceased belongings, but at the same time those chosen songs gives them their own peace as Move to Haven takes care of their final move.

I love how this teach us morals and values, within the spectrum of life and death, love and loss, and in the way on how it depicts the 5 stages of grief in each case and also with our two main characters, GeuRoo who wasn't fond of the idea of letting his father go, and SanGoo who also couldn't let go of SuCheol. Both struggling with denial and aceptance of their own losses.
In the end they both also learn with their losses, surpassing the 5 stages through the storyline.

It's a blessing in only 10 episodes, heartbreaking, heartwarming, tear-jerking, and meaningful ride.
That I highly recommend to everyone. Don't be discouraged by the heavy ""theme"", this centers more on the sidelines and personal stories than any gory death or anything like that, this drama focus on the lost messages for the loved ones left behind, or the memorials and respect in life and death, and on how valuable each and every life it no matter what age, gender, background, etc.

Every single person has a story to tell.

Move to Heaven, provides the means of those who couldn't tell theirs in their lifetime.

Definitely a 10 out of 10 from me.

Masterpiece focusing on many social problems, very insightful
Move to heaven is a 10 episode drama its shorter than most dramas but the impact cannot be compared to other dramas.
This drama is one of the few that I actually binge watched, I finished in less than 2 days, which is very fast for me. I watched it all the time except the time I was eating or sleeping.

First of all the topic of the drama itself puts it in another level compared to other dramas. Death, a taboo topic not brought up in everyday conversations. Death can happen alike to the young and old though more to the old, this drama covers both, extensively. Death due to old age, illness, accidents, murder etc. Are all covered.
This show depicts a autistic teenager and his father who help cleaning up after the death of a person. They clear up thier belongings and try to understand the life of the deceased by observing. Learning stories through the objects they left behind and helping the ones left behind to move on while understanding the feelings of the deceased.
Autism is very well depicted and acted out. All the actors did exceptional jobs at portraying their characters too.
The storyline is written so well the writer definitely has earned a new fan. The stories are all complex, including many layers that are unearthed slowly. It doesn't just look at death but many other social problems like adoption by foreigners of koreans, the question of right to die, old age problems, homosexuality, toxic relationships to name a few. These problems especially the problem of old age is something I hold close to my heart, so I felt this deep in my heart. Such a huge spectrum of problems covered in a drama is rare, but move to heaven did it, not just did it, they did it exceptionally well and also brought in tears to your eyes every few episodes.
The show also showed the life of the main characters, I really enjoyed the backstory which was naturally brought in by the writer and also loved the way the relationship of the uncle and the nephew developed in time.
The nephew's character is actually the best character, he's so caring and kind in his own way I always feel empathetic and attached to him.
The lack of osts is the only flaw I can find in this masterpiece, but it really didn't matter because I didn't even realise until I searched for osts and found classical music instead, which only introduced more music, so I'm not mad.

This is a drama I recommend everyone to watch, it'll change your life.

Worth every tear spent
I usually don't cry watching series or movies, but this time I cried non-stop while watching this drama. I fell in love with the characters, and that's because you can sympathize with them, you can feel their pain, their grief, and their happiness. ""Move to heaven"" makes you stop and think about your life, your soul, and who you love. You begging to observe the small details you couldn't before, or even feel others' pain, others' lives and stories. Maybe even realize how you're not alone in the world, in one way or another. There's always someone with you.

I think is a must-watch show to everyone who's feeling a little lost, disconnected from the world. Who knows, maybe you will find your path in the world.

Epitome of slice of life
There is no words to explain how meaningful this drama was. I did not expect much from it from that Netflix preview also because it was dubbed for reasons unknown to me. Never watch the dubbed version, watch the Korean one because it is a piece of art.
The acting was perfect from all the members. The attention to detail in this level was last seen by me in the Reply series and Hospital Playlist.
It is beautiful and thought provoking. It has very important life lessons and well rounded characters, it is in the end of the day a person-centric drama. A perferct example of a slice of life indeed.

thank you!
i... i never made a review before. but, somehow, this is the first time that i have a need to talk. still, i'm not sure about the right words to use it... i feel like my body need more time to understand why i was in an emotional roller-coaster for more than 10 hours straight. you're lying if you say you didn't cried watching a scene, and i'm talking about dramas in general, at least once you felt all the feelings they tried to pass to you. i felt. i felt everything, in a different scale. this was the first time that i genuinely felt what they were feeling. to be honest, was a little bit scary, i couldn't control my heart or my tears. i literally couldn't control my body. meanwhile, i learned so much, so so so much, that makes me feel grateful for every minute they worked filming it. move to heaven was to me... a hug, a class, a therapy, a friend, a family, a sad love.

I cried so much I got a headache that's how good it was.
Move to Heaven manages to capture life& death perfectly in my opinion. Painting a picture of grief that feels natural is very hard to do. It's a complex process, insanely different for everyone. Yet, they manage to make it feel relatable and universal.

The cinematic beauty of every single shot is as beautifully crafted as the plot itself. The same goes for the brilliant acting done by the 3 main leads, one of whose character is autistic in nature. Also, despite an absence of an active romantic plot, you still hope to see sparks fly between the other two characters solely for the perfectly nailed subtle chemistry shimmering between the two.

Another one of my favourite things about the show were the cleaning montages. To the sound of classical musical, with no lyrics whatsoever. Han Geu-ru let the deceased do the talking. Life feels surprisingly long yet so incredibly short at the same time. And no matter how young or old you die, your life still fits inside a sunshine yellow box. But no matter how alone you may be in life, there will always be someone to collect your box in death.

Lee Je Hoon's Chang-gu feels very special to me. He's very flawed. Who wouldn't be after going what he went through, but he grows, and he changes-so gradually you almost miss it. You catch yourself liking him before you know it. There was no big traumatic event that moved him towards change, it was a collection of small moments that feel minuscule in comparison to the amount of hurt he experienced. Chang-gu can be any of us, jaded by life and filled with spiteful bitterness. But through new experiences, working at Move to Heaven and being Geu-ru's guardian, he starts seeing the world differently. His character development was seamless.

Must-watch in the current pandemic times when almost all of us have lost someone or the other and can relate to the feelings of grief and what comes thereafter.

An emotional rollarcoaster
I'm typically a person that doesn't cry to kdramas, but with ""Move to Heaven"" I cried during every episode; once even sobbed straight through the 45 minute long ep.

Even though most of the episodes followed the same pattern, trauma cleaning cases + the general plot of the story moving forward, it never felt repetitive. Each case was unique and the plot was nicely done, which makes you really focus on the actual message of the show.

The acting was phenomenal and made you ache, cry or laugh with the characters. I especially wanna compliment Tang Junsang for his realistic acting of a person who has Asperger's syndrome, even though I understand that each person who has this might act differently.

This was simply an amazing show and I recommend everyone to watch it; but be warned that it's a tear-jerker!

Every tears brought to me by this drama is totally worth it
18/10

It's been ages since I've seen a kdrama that made me cry so damn hard. I think the last time I've bawled like this was Scarlet heart. And watching this satisfies my hunger for a a drama like this.

First of all, I really love their concept of trauma cleaners and made Geu-ru a unique person. It is so special and captivates me right away. I love how the characters developed and every stories of the dead people talk about the society. How fucked up and it is and makes you realize and think about a person's situation before you judge them. I like how they only put instrumental music when a heavy scene is being portrayed. Makes you appreciate the acting done and cry not because of the sad song but because of the acting made at that heavy scene.

The ending might be kind of open. But it ended in a very beautiful way. And how it gives a subtle hint of season 2 because of some unresolved business with the uncle and that mysterious girl.

But overall, again, if I can rate this masterpiece more than 10, I'll rate it 18 because that's my favourite number and shows how I became attached on every stories tackled and told by this art.

What A Wonderful Surprise Of A Drama !!!!!!!!!!!!
What a drama! Nothing you can expect! Lee Je Hoon totally surprise me with his character. He looked like a different person. The stories with each episode is great. The characters are all great. I enjoy this drama so much. How well the actors portrait their characters. I have a special person who is Autistic and Tang Jun Sang portrayed the character perfectly. I hated to see it finish and hoping for a second season. I give it to the director and the writers this was a perfect story. From the music, to each topic in every episode, which I learn so much, was touching and so well done. It is my favorite this year.

Awesome.......!
Since from Frist trailer i knew the fact that this drama going to be a masterpiece. You can actually feel that vibe from the trailer itself. It's been almost 2 months now after it got released on Netflix but it took me some time to watch and finally i finished and just want to say something about it. This is really an awesome experience, i don't know How can a kdrama make you go through all the human emotions every time you watch....? I mean there were always something the magical behind all the kdramas still i can't figure it out that. But anyway Move to heaven is a must watch drama.

So as always am not going deep into the story and plot which you can understand after you watch the trailer. So you knew everything that's going to happen from the trailer. But still it's a wonderful experience. Here everything was so perfect. And 2 things that clinch you till the end. One was the performance of Tang ju Sung & Lee je hoon and the other thing was the writing.. each and every scene and that dialogues are really heartwarming.

10 episode with short duration can say around 45 min each was a feel free watch experience. There was not a much dragging or boring sequences. The finale episode was so touching.. for a moment i thought of i don't want to end this drama. Its a pure masterpiece. Definitely you must watch this if you are a feel good slice of life drama lover.. Go god this made day❤️ i can't forget this experience for a long....

LOVELY is what this is
This drama is such a fine quality. Top-notch acting, aesthetic cinematography, authentic story. But most importantly, the quality of relationships. (High quality human relationships are my medicine.) Every single thing about this is beautiful. It's worth every tear and emotion that puts you through every episode.

Also, I'm in love with Sanggu and especially his hair style. Last but not least, I want to hug Geuru so much but I won't and you know why. But I guess I can force hug Sanggu and Namu. I'm also in love with her and Geuru's names. As one can see, this fills you with love so much that it turns you into a headless chicken who wants to love and hug every one of them that comes across you.

One of the best and loveliest things I've ever watched. Thanks to whomever so much for making this.

Move to Heaven is a very touching drama that focuses on a boy with autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder - ASD. ( ASD is a developmental disability that can cause major social and behavioral challenges. There is nothing in the appearance of an autistic person that ""tells us"" that this person is autistic, we usually sense it by their way of communicating, interact or learn).

Like i said previously, the story is about a boy that has to encounter a big change in his life. We follow his quotidian, but not that only. One of  the things i love about this drama is how they connect the main story with side stories.

Its very touching and interesting, i highly recommend it.

BEAUTIFUL
I'll start off this by saying that I'm not one to cry while watching movies or series, and I if I do, it's mostly just a little bit of tearing up.
Move To Heaven had me crying my eyes out, tears streaming down my cheeks at least once per episodes.
The clever story line and superb acting provided us with an excellent first series.
Despite having barely understanding of korean, the raw and powerful emotions that the cast performed was what stood out and by not knowing the language the emotions portrayed was the main focus point for me, instead of what was being said.
I laughed, cried, and felt a renewed sense of gratitude for life and death.
Overall this is one of my favorite series I've ever seen, and I say that despite not really being an avid k-drama viewer.

This drama is now my favorite drama. I am bias I will say that now, my son is disabled and this made me feel for the sitation very quickly. I loved this story it was sad and sweet. The job the family does is touching and Gur ha is the driving force of why it it works. Certain scenes in this were hard for me to watch only because I have seen my son go through similar reactions to things but I have to say this was beautiful. Every case the family worked on could make somebody cry. Each story they learn and share with a family in one form or another is heartbreaking and learning about the team as we go along and watch then grow and change more then some shows characters do in five seasons over the course of only 10 epispdes. When they cry you cry. I would rewatch and I would recomend. This was so well acted and shot.

Love this story.
I was impressed by how the writer of this drama implemented and fictionized trauma cleaners in most heartwarming, beautiful and thoughtful way. I know that there is no trauma cleaner like Geuru in real life. There is no trauma cleaner who organizes and collects items from the belongings like Gruru does and try every effort to deliver box(yellow box is created for this story also) to the deceased's family or friends. In reality, trauma cleaner's main job is to clean out the spaces and belongings of the deceased. However still the job itself is a very hardworking one and it face a lot of obstacles and diffulties in real life. It demands your devotion and professionalism but heardly not many people recognize what they are doing. And this is one of the thing I value about this drama. This drama introduced trauma cleaners for the first time and made people realize that we should show more respect to what they are doing for us and give more attention and care about people living around us.

GREAT WRITER!! GREAT STORY!!!

10/10 from an autistic fan
As an autistic man myself, this drama warmed my heart a lot. Geu-ru doesn't share many symptoms with me, personally (as autism is a spectrum), but from other autistic people I've known and my own understanding of the disorder as someone who has it, he was portrayed very accurately and sensitively. I really appreciate the strong support Geu-ru had, both from his father and Na-mu, and the message throughout that just because he has autism doesn't mean he should be treated any lesser. The balance between his support network, and the misunderstanding and mistreatment he got from others was very well portrayed as well. Autistic people's lives are often not easy, as many people don't know what we go through, and often have no interest in learning how to accommodate us, but we're not without hope or understanding. Geu-ru didn't have a tragic life with no friends, but he wasn't free of societal problems either. Aside from the stunning autistic rep, this drama made my best friend and I cry at least three times, and did a very nice job of portraying diversity and complexity in human experiences. The episodic format worked for it well, and every second was enjoyable and satisfying, while overall bittersweet and gentle. Very good vibes from this drama, for sure going to watch it again and probably show my mom!

Easy-to-binge and gets all the onion-triggered water out of your eyes
It's been a long while since I watched a whole kdrama in one day/sitting. This broke it. Highly underrated even though it was a Netflix original.

Let's dissect the storyline. Even though it didn't have my ideal beginning, it was still very fast-paced and allowed for the main character to be introduced. They quickly introduce the second main character and end that episode off with a very satisfying cliffhanger. I love how every episode introduced a different mini-storyline within the larger one, while allowing the main characters to develop. I also liked how they connected the story between the two main characters and allowed us to go back in time and sympathize with them. (This was the tear-jerking part.) I love dramas that are either completely romance or have a mystery/crime plot with a bit of romance. This was the latter aka my favorite.

Let's talk about the actors now. I don't know much about autism or Asperger's so I cannot comment on how well the main character, Tang Jun Sang, acted. However, I can comment on Lee Je Hoon's. Something about him at first glance was so charming. He embodied his role to the full, from the way he talked, the way he smirked, and his body language. I expect so much more for him in this genre of kdramas, and I'm excited to see more of him. Lastly, Hong Seung Hee was a very nice side (and female) character to have. She wasn't an especially necessary character to the plot, but she was in screenplay because she was the one reciprocating the comedic relief from Lee Je Hoon. The only problem I had with her was that her connection with the main character seemed just too random.

Overall, I HIGHLY RECCOMEND this drama.

Move to Heaven is well written and the cast is excellent with actor Lee Je Hoon convincing as a boxer and wastrel.

In addition to a strong story arcs for the two male leads, the drama handled the controversial subject matters highlighted in each episode such as domestic abuse, adoption and Korea's history of overseas adoptions, poor work and living conditions for low-paid workers, poor social care for the elderly, etc. with sensitivity and an even hand. My only complaint is the horribly twee final scene of the final episode which was contrived and totally unnecessary.

The music didn't intrude and production value was generally good. I particularly liked the aerial shots of the Move to Heaven van driving through the neighbourhood.

I highly recommend Move to Heaven and look forward to rewatching it.

Great Melodrama
Wow... To be honest, I never get emotional to the every episodes while watching it except the last episode where all the pain happened. Just wow, Great story line at least for me. Is it just me that the story is not lacking but still It feels like I need more? XD.... Let's talk about some traits there....XD ...., wow did I just witnessed some open relationship there in the ep5? I think they did well writing about it, we all know Sk is not open about it but it well delivered by the story. Lastly, I don't know if that's a fact that some issues in the story like the adoption and the building one where Gu Reu's father working in before, that's why I appreciated the writing of the story. Hmmmm, this will be the last.... I THINK THIS DRAMA IS WORTH TO WATCH ON!!!!!

Heartwarming and Fresh
Oh wow, what can I say? I really enjoyed every bit of this drama that I want another season. It is wonderful to discover the world of trauma cleaners, esp. Move to Heaven. I've never watched anything like this before. The acting is amazing. All actors delivered well. There were many times that I shed some tears while watching this.

Go ahead and watch this, it is worth your while esp. when you're into human stories. Just like what I've said, this needs a second season and I'm so up for it.

I'll give it a perfect 10 once S2 is confirmed!!! Jebal.

A Work of Art...
Move to Heaven is a beautifully written masterpiece, exploring the value of life and death through a heart-wrenching story. It brings light to many issues within society, such as LBGT+ representation etc.; when I say I have never watched a drama any better, I do not kid.

The casting was impeccable. The drama perfectly displays multiple feelings and executes them perfectly to viewers. For the entirety of the show, I was crying my eyes out (while simping for LJH).

The music was also touching. As a fellow pianist myself, upon hearing Traumerei (a favourite of mine) play in the trailer, I gave it a shot. Throughout all of the trauma cleaning sessions, Geu-Ru plays a specific piece that melted my heart. Everything showed in the drama seemed to have a strong, meaningful message which could be interpreted further by viewers.

He was a character with such depth, quite rare in other dramas. Cho Sang-Gu was also an amazingly well-played character. Lee Je Hoon has a natural tendency to melt into his role; it was enthralling. His character development was evident and heart-warming to watch. Starting as a cold character, you can see him adapt to his new environment just as Geu-ru does, and they both become comfortable with each other. In terms of side characters, they all played a perfect part in the story and didn't feel out of place. The chemistry was amazing.

By watching this drama, I have become grateful for everything I have. LJH is an actor who stars in meaningful dramas, and I find that a wonderful trait. Move to Heaven holds a special place in my heart — a drama like no other.

I'll be rewatching this drama soon.

I cry in every episode.
I finally watched this drama so many people recommended me ... I don’t know if I should say thank you or fuck you.
Because there wasn’t a single episode where I didn’t cry but I couldn't stop watching. Jesus Christ, where do I start?

if you’re looking for romance and drama cliche don’t watch this ... if you’re looking for a heartwarming story that will make you cry both from happiness and sadness go for it. Even when I said I cried in every episode I don't consider this a sad drama but would call it an emotional piece of life story that talks about love, family, happiness, grief, loss, making hard decisions, and how those might lead to an end, the complexity of feelings around death, not knowing what others are going through and that desperate feeling of not being able to help the people we love... there's a lot this show unpack.

in every episode, we follow Han Geu Ru, an autistic 20 years old who, next to his dad, runs a trauma cleaning company called ""move to heaven"" where they basically clean the belongings of people that pass away. In every cleaning, we learn about respecting the deceased and how even in death we leave messages and stories behind that speak for us, Geu Ru always tried his best to give everyone peace and closure which I think it's the best part of this drama. When his father dies Geu Ru needs to live and run the business with his uncle and step by step they get closer and break each other's walls to become a family. I loved seeing them together.

I can't speak on the autistic representation but I'd love to listen to the insight of any autistic person that watched the show.

overall: great characters, productions again Netflix is an aesthetic hoe and the strongest part of the show (for me) is the way every episode finds a way to pierce into your heart, hit so close home somehow and see everyone in move to heaven trying to help to give peace to someone gave me peace as well.

Grab Your Tissues
I had no expectations going into this drama. I vaguely read the synopsis and just gave it a go. Boy, was I invested! This drama moved me so hard. I found it unwatchable at times because my heart felt full. Don't get me wrong, it's not a heartbreaking story. It's a story about mourning and growing. The realistic depiction of Asperger's syndrome, showing us the problems and complexities of such a person is commendable. There is so much to learn from this drama and I think it will always remain a beautiful memory. I am so glad I watched this masterpiece.

Refreshing, heartbreaking and quite a new concept. Whole drama comprised of ten individual demise stories. A person when dies leaves behind wonderful memories, his/her offspring, some search for love, some die with love, some die with pain and sufferings, some die untimely, some take away their own life, some die simply because their time ends; everything is extremely heartwarming. Tears did not want to take any name to stop running relentlessly. It shattered my heart every time Han Geu Ru ran panting, with that rectangular yellow box to handover it to the deceased’s loved ones, containing a person’s used belongings. Is it easy to erase everything out of one’s life just because s/he left this superficial world? Life is real so is death. Diverse perceptions, thoughts, philosophies, dogmas, beliefs, faiths, cultures, traditions etc. are existent in this earth but no one denies the inevitable fate of death of every living creature.

Move to Heaven beautified this death. Although we come without anything and also leave without anything but each human creates a web of relationships, complex emotions, needs, wants, expression of tastes, longing for a smooth and better life; however, it might cut short. We have stories to tell which are left untold, we have grievances to share which are left grieved upon, we have love to express which are left unexpressed, and we have multifarious wishes to fulfil which are left unfulfilled. All humans are unsung heroes of their own life or someone’s life. The depiction is truly heart rendering. Portrayal of every death was truly magnificent.

We live as if we are immortal beings. Different sorts of love, respect, dignity, sympathy, empathy, ugly human greed, societal issues made its place in this drama from humanistic point of view. Every interaction every words we speak every gesture we make has meaning(s) though often times we try to hide our genuine emotions underneath our superficial façade. The drama basically highlighted all these factors from philosophical perspective. How the living perceive the death and how the end of a person is just his/her mortality and physicality that expires only. Nonetheless, either good or bad, they keep on living as enriched memories of some other people.

Impressive was also the direction, cinematography, editing and some specific camera angle managed to retain the true aesthetics of the story. Individual stories were solid and sufficiently shown without making them too overdramatic or too draggy.

Tang Jun Sang, this child actor stole my heart away with his untainted innocent acting. His talent is boundless. Such adorable young fellow has a really bright future ahead. All the ensemble made their characters believable by putting their heart and soul into displaying a natural acting. They all did exceptionally well.

Cried buckets and learned many things. No one should refrain oneself from watching this gem. Indulge yourself in this short journey, you would not regret.

ITS SO GOOD WTF
(first time writing a review on here lol, sorry if it's messy)

This drama is BY FAR one of the best ones that I've seen. Usually I don't expect much from these short dramas, but DAMN. From the start, I just KNEW this was gonna become one of my top dramas.

(idk where to start but uhh)

First off, Geu-ru was great and finally, we have an autistic character that isn't just some big maths/science nerd (I mean, unless you consider fish as marine biology but what I'm trying to say is that he's not like some of the other neurodivergent rep in kdramas *COUGH* Nam Dosan *COUGH*) and as an autistic person myself it was really nice to see some positive autistic rep. Only minor complaint I have is that Asperger's isn't a term used anymore (plus Hans Asperger was a right ol dickhead) so I wish they just said that Geu-ru was autistic instead. But then again, Asperger's only stopped being a medical term in 2013, and Geu-ru got diagnosed before then (also, I don't really expect Jeong-u to know about this since he's not a doctor or anything). Tang Jun-sang really did a good job at portraying Geu-ru tbh (I still associate him with Geum Eun-dong from CLOY, but that's just my CLOY-loving arse innit. Geu-ru was still great tho).

Then there's Sang-gu who I think had the best character development in this drama. Honestly, the first time I saw him I was incredibly pissed at that ugly ableist piece of shite (""wHy sHoUlD i CaRe fOr JeOnG-u's HaNdIcApPeD sOn?"" GOD SHUT THE FUCK UP) but I'm glad that he redeemed himself and became a nice guardian to Geu-ru. Aside from that, after hearing about his past trauma and what happened with Su-cheol, I've grown to feel sorry for him and tbh, I ended up hating that ugly ass Madam instead. I'm still pissed at her for basically forcing Sang-gu to fight Su-cheol, he clearly didn't want to do it and how Su-cheol inevitably died because of him?? Fuck Madam, all my homies hate Madam.

Ok right, enough waffling about the characters. Now about the actual plot of the drama itself. Tbh the entire storyline was sad yet beautiful, but there is just ONE part that I am particularly salty about (which I will now complain about here). I have put a spoiler warning, but in case you didn't pay attention to that, here's your reminder to go watch Move to Heaven before continuing this (I mean there's already enough spoilers up until this point but just watch it pls).

IAN AND SOOHYUN DESERVED SO MUCH BETTER!! Their love story is the only reason why I'm giving the plot 9/10 instead of 10/10. And I'm still mad at the fact that Soohyun died (yes I get that the whole point of this show is to clean out dead people's rooms and that if he didn't die then he wouldn't be in drama, but still. I JUST LOVE HIM OK). All I want is for him and Ian to be able to live happily together (tbh I still want a plot twist where Soohyun isn't actually dead and gets to live happily ever after with Ian. Season 2 pls?). Seriously, what is it with me and falling for second lead couples with tragic endings? Soohyun's parents were right ol cunts as well. I mean, think about it. If they never forced him to get married in Korea, Soohyun would probably be living happily with Ian in San Francisco right now. But seriously, being homophobic is one thing, but burning love letters from your dead son? Honestly I'm so glad that Geu-ru has an amazing memory, or otherwise that letter would've been lost forever and Ian would've never seen it (or known what Soohyun wanted to say to him). (if any fic writers are reading this rn, PLS GIVE IAN AND SOOHYUN THE HAPPY ENDING THEY DESERVE!! Since I know they'll never get their own drama).

Thank you to anyone who has read this piece of pure waffle (honestly I'm gonna be surprised if anyone has made it to this point) but anyways, in conclusion Move to Heaven is going on the Elite 2021 Dramas List and they better be making a Season 2 soon (yea I get that S2 is unlikely, but I would at least like to know what happens to Cha Eunbyeol)

Best Korean Drama of 2021 (So Far)
One of the best Korean drama I've ever watched. Elegant writing, directing, editing, casting, and acting with all beautiful stories told, characters, and visual ever served.

There is no single episode where I didn't cry, I love all of the deceased background stories and the acting of the three main leads are remarkable. Such marvelous storytelling and spot on music bgm just blend so well to the overall plot. Wonderfully done in such a heart touching way.

A special shoutout to Tang Jun Sang, Lee Jee Hoon, and Hong Seung Hee for brilliantly potraying the character, clearly become one of my favorite characters in Korean drama.

The whole plot, idea, and concept are very fresh. Definitely will make you so attached with all the stories and characters, definitely will make you hardly able to get over this for weeks, and definitely worth watching.

A Meaningful Story About Todays Society
To be honest I wasn't expecting a lot from this drama. I just clicked on it without thinking that much. I never thought I would cry this much (so much that my estranged mother was so concerned) and laugh to my heart's content. A beautifully well put together plot along with amazing casts. Each and everyone fulfilled their role and left a mark in my fragile heart. Please don't hesitate to give it a try. It maybe seem strange by just skimming around the edges but this drama is truly the concept of Do Not Judge A Book By It's Cover.

Dear Reader Happy Watching. Xoxo

Refreshing and unique storyline
Although it did not invoke as many emotions and tears in me as many other viewers, it is seriously a gem of a show. Most episodes just made me angry at how terribly selfish society can be. But they always brought it back to wholesomeness in the end. Everything from the portrayal of Aspergers to the dedication and respect they have towards the dead and their belongings is flawless. Very likeable, realistic characters.
P.S.
+0.5 star for Episode 5 - the one that affected me the most and genuinely made me super emotional. Well done scriptwriter!

This is drama for generation. It needs to be notice, it deserved to be talked abouts, and discussed.
Aesthetically on high-level, questioning the most important points of human life and importance of verbal, mental, physical, social, emotional development and the inability of developing them all on the same level. There are so many factors that influence one's development.

The concept of the drama and the backstory were brilliant. A touching sad, heartwarming and brilliant drama all along. This drama challenges lots of things that we wrongfully take for granted in today's society.

High quality acting. Tang Jun Sang gives one of the best performance ever perfomed by a Korean actors. Supported by amazing Lee Je Hoon and Ji Jin Hee and there isn't one single actor in this drama who didn't do their job to absolute perfection which make this drama on it's another level.

Watch this one! It shoves a fist in the face of convention and mainstream society. Great drama that argues its point with elegance and entertainment.

A yellow box full of a person's treasured belongings ...
What if you were able to distill a person's essence down to the treasured items, one could fit into a single yellow box? What messages would they share?

These are the questions that Move to Heaven poses. Over the drama's ten episodes, it is able to weave a beautiful story that looks to honor the lives of the dead. Throughout its run, I admired how the drama didn't shy away from broaching weighty and sometimes controversial topics whether it was neurodivergence, domestic violence, double suicide, unnaturalized citizenship, and adoption. This drama is strikingly executed and beautifully acted. Move to Heaven was deeply moving and pulled at my heartstrings. Probably not a great drama for the faint of heart. This was one of the best dramas so far this year!

A life-changing tale that lingers long after you've finished it
I don't think I spent a lot of time reading reviews/comments or even the synopsis on MDL before I began watching this. I saw the preview on Netflix and immediately dived into it. I don't remember the last time I took such a brilliant decision. What began as a curiousity induced weekend watch turned into a series of life altering lessons.

I knew the premise of this show, I knew that there would be loss, grief, the aftermath of a life lost, I'd also hoped for a lot of healing. What I'd never imagined was such a beautiful amalgamation of all in a manner that would speak to my soul. I've never seen or heard of this sort of a plot, which centers around trauma cleaners ( I could have missed them, though, I'll surely look this up ) and this made my experience of watching this unprecedented. It made me question the way we live, and what we leave behind. I spent a good amount of time last night thinking what would my yellow moving box hold? What about my loved ones? It was a jarring night to say the least. This story, has moved me and definitely brought a change in the way I look at the world around me.

The people I was introduced to in this show might be fictional but each one of them taught me so much. Each scene/client the team of Move To Heaven visited taught me so much. Recalling the moments brings warmth to my heart and a smile to my face. Even if some of the stories were heartbreaking, each left a clear picture which emphasized the importance of compassion and love that is shared between people.

I'm truly grateful to all the actors for their incredible work, the writer(s), the production team - everyone involved in making this gem. The characters, the stories, the lessons are all going to stay with me for life. And I don't say that lightly at all. The little details, the little things that go unnoticed, the little moments - the show highlights the importance of all that and so much more in an exquisite way. I urge you, dear reader, to watch this, with your families, friends, loved ones, or just by yourself too - but do watch it. It was an epiphanic experience.

That moment when u unexpectedly get hit by massive waves of feels
Bruh, i started watching coz they said it was the heart-warming, feel good type drama nd i wanted to watch sth adorable....what i got was tears, no joke. The entire first episode had me bawling my brains out nd i needed to sleep it off like...literal wtf moment. Afterwards every single episode, somehow or other i ended up crying nd i was so mad! I wasnt such a crybaby before but its just, the emotionally engaging environment throughout the drama specially heightened my feelings of empathy nd my heart went out to all of them ?? im honestly so glad i watched it, the actors were so talented, specially geu-ru omg he acted spectacularly nd it was absolutely adorable to watch. The way the characters grew and the relationships developed was absolutely precious T_T the way the story pointed out the problems in the society so realistically and portrayed the deceased characters with such care and respect deserves nothing but praise and admiration. Move to heaven had a special message in every episode while progessing with their own story at the same time nd along with our main characters, it honestly made me feel nd learn a lot too, such a beautiful concept ;-; the grief nd tears were worth it. This is definitely becoming one of my fav dramas.

YOLO
You know all those little stories in 'Guardian: The Lonely and Great Gong Yoo' about the lives and deaths of strangers? They all carried the concise poignancy that made viewers weep and the Grim Reaper momentarily stop thinking about that fried chicken place. They were beautiful, potent, and thoughtful about death.

Similarly, 'Move to Heaven' uses episodic vignettes that cover the life and death of the eponymous company's clients, with a focus on a particular loose end or regret (think Mystic Pop-Up Bar, but with maggots). Each story touches on a meditative nuance about death that really pokes at that existential ulcer in your being. It's kind of like watching the first ten minutes of Pixar's 'Up' over and over again. You know, like, fun stuff.

Therefore, our protagonists feel dutifully obliged to provide closure. These stories form under a larger story arc of trauma cleaners that arrange a person's ""final move"" after their death that encapsulates underground MMA matches, cinematic trips to the aquarium, and lots of Na-Mu's mom throwing trash onto the street.

'Move to Heaven' will make you want to hug your loved ones a little tighter while your own mortality bristles at its firming.

The deceased ones can speak to us... But in a different way.
A short, but a very memorable one. Such a tearjerker 4 me.

This drama tells us the life of Han Geu-Ru, a trauma cleaner, which is someone who cleans the rooms of the deceased.

Took a long time before watching this, as both the synopsis and poster isn't engaging enough as I thought this is a drama about a mortician (like my all-time fav Japanese movie ""Departures"", you must watch this too if you like Move to Heaven), but I made the right decision to watch this one. I am instantly hooked from the start. Such a heartwarming, meaningful drama (which brought me to tears :""))

I extremely like everything, from how Han Jeong-U, Geu-Ru's dad taught and brought Geu-Ru with his heartwarming ways, the character development of Cho Sang-Gu, Geu-Ru's uncle, the backstories of the deceased, how Move to Heaven worked with all their heart to preserve the memories of the deceased, and how they find the ones they should give the items of the deceased.

P.S. I REALLY want Geu-Ru's classical playlist so bad!!!! Loved how they put Debussy's Claire de Lune, Saint-Saëns' Gymnopedie, Chopin's Nocturne etc. when MTH is cleaning, which are my favorite Piano pieces I play when I'm bored :'')

This drama will change your perspective towards life
This drama is going to be so close to my heart :”)
I urge everyone to please give this a watch
Whether you watch kdramas or no
This is the kind of drama which teaches you so much:”)
Every person in your life has a purpose, respect them, cherish them, enjoy every bit of the time spent with them. :”)
The story is about a young boy with Asperger syndrome and his uncle who work as trauma cleaners, clearing out the possessions of dead people, uncovering the stories they left behind and telling them to loved ones.
The series is all about emotions and feelings, especially, empathy towards the deceased who are no more in the world yet they have left their own messages to their loved once.

The way the story started the way it went forward every bit of it just leaves such a huge impact :”)
10 episodes and each of the 10 episodes made me go through such a roller coaster of emotions :”)

I don’t understand how this drama has been so underrated and why aren’t people watching it :”)
You’re definitely missing out on something so beautiful
Please go watch “move to heaven”
Much love and respect to the whole team of this drama :”)

A very unconventional description of death -- as it should be
It made me ponder a lot about the beauty and inevitability of death. You know how when the people you love died and you tend to search for their last remains. The last thing they touched. Their last message. What were the thoughts of people whom they have interacted with? You smell the fresh sheets and clothes they left. What kind of legacy did they have when they departed. This show perfectly describes that feeling. It defined death and the feeling of losing someone in such a beautiful way.

Apart from the aforementioned, on the technical things in this series, the one who played Geu-ru was phenomenal. It seems that he really studied his role for this as well as Sang-gu for being a slightly sluggish personality. It made me cry especially on the third and final episode. The OST was also well-picked EXCEPT on grieving parts about their client's death. However, Geu-ru's taste in classical music is still nice.

This drama may not be one of my most favorite but you will definitely learn a thing or two from it. Everything about Move to Heaven is wonderful and honest. I heard that this is rated as 19+ in Korea, but it's quite understandable since death remains a taboo in their country (or in any country, I guess). But again, that's the beauty of it, it tackles death in the most unconventional yet frank way of its nature.

Trauma Cleaners — their job, life, and trauma
Had anyone asked me a few weeks ago, before I started watching Move to Heaven, I wouldn’t be so aware on the life of trauma cleaners. Regardless whether it’s a drama or real life, trauma cleaners must endure creepy scenes over a pressuring environment. Constantly moving their car to not be seen, closing the shades while working, are two of many other environment’s pressuring requests. Additionally, it is obligatory for the trauma cleaners (at least in this series) to “deliver” messages from the deceased and their loved stuffs handed in special yellow box. Move To Heaven also allows viewers to have a glance on the life of our hero whom has an Asperger Syndrome and recently-deceased only parent. Hold on, that’s a lot already. Are we in for a journey with worthwhile tears? Honestly, this is more than that. As compelling as it sounds, the series continuously steers our emotions on every single episode, making no room for boredom.

Move to Heaven is absolutely one of a kind drama. The peculiar premise lived up to its expectations as it consistently delivered meaningful slice of life-like narrative. The plot in general is well-connected to each other although some might need reminders to subtle details (like the female detective at the last episode). The dynamics have a good portion of everything. They didn’t make it depressing, or too funny, or too angsty. Everything is well-balanced to one another.

The trauma cleaning subplots (the deceased stories) were crafted in poking criticisms of the society coated with heart-wrenching stories. People did not realize how precious their loved ones actually is until those valued memories of them transformed into regrets. Distinctive arguments shape-shifted into glitched unrepairable tape constantly repeating on the living’s head. This series helped us learn to respectfully love people as who they are—whether they may be bothersome, having different perspectives, or in a contrasting social class.

Onto our main characters, I would like to applaud the writers once again for conveying Han Geuru (and his surrounding)’s stories with countless heartwarming aspects. As we have already known, Han Geuru had been living a struggling life after his father’s passing, only for his past to be way more harsh than we could have ever imagined. However, Geuru wasn’t really perceptive in terms of emotions, making him a strong individual that kept moving forward. Geuru mostly carried the trauma cleaning service with his extra attention to details. His extremely-observant nature pushed Move to Heaven into having detective-like journey. Throughout the series, the 20 year-old boy had a fantastic character arc (emphasis on letting Father go). Shoutout to Tang Junsang for portraying Han Geuru effortlessly.

Cho Sanggu had lived a contrasting life. Although his contrasting attitude may be seen as bothersome, his character development is perfect by growing fondly of Geuru (really love their chemistry). Sanggu also has a deep trauma that made him held grudges in the past. Not only about his paternal brother but also his “hoobae” in boxing. Eventually, this series helped him overcame those with strings of occasional events (hint: Amusement Park and Train Station). Parts of Sanggu’s stories might have appeared on another series yet it comes handy overall. The supporting characters did not really have strong plots or arcs but they were supporting for a reason. My only criticism would be the lack of Namu’s family stories (and her past) as viewers never get to see what happened inside her house. On the other hand, Namu’s character balanced the main two perfectly.

As Move To Heaven is an original Netflix series, I always found them to be different with cable or free-to-air dramas. Move To Heaven doesn’t necessarily felt like “another” kdrama at all, it stands out. I am personally a frequent Kdrama viewer (on top of a Kpop fan) and always subtly annoyed with the same sets being used in multiple series, but this is not the case here. Move to Heaven explores many locations that I never or barely saw on other Kdramas. Notably, they also use a different approach when it comes to cinematography. Furthermore, the VFX team did an outstanding job especially in visualizing Geuru’s attention to details. I always love every moments when all those stuffs in the yellow box flew above Geuru’s head, aligned, with him trying to crack a code. Every episode has a decent length between 40-60 minutes and far from being formulaic (a problem that usually occurs in “another” kdrama). Move To Heaven’s production team really paid attention to details and it paid off. Other than one thing, there’s no such accommodating or memorable OST here.

On a final note, Move to Heaven is a new magnum opus within the new series being released. Everything about this drama is perfectly well-balanced of each other—whether it be the plot, characters, or supporting elements in general. All being well for Season 2 to be picked up soon (in the same or better quality cause we don't want a mess like the other Netflix original series *coughs* Love Alarm *coughs*). We need more episodes as 10 of it is certainly too short!

A beautiful drama including many interesting stories
This drama was very unique and I loved it. The drama goes through many different stories as the main leads work together. All of these stories are about people who passed away and the people around them making this drama very sad in my opinion.

The characters were all unique and interesting making me want to know more and the casting was amazing. I especially loved Lee Je Hoon in this drama. I would really enjoy a second season of this drama. It made me want more.

This drama is a must watch for kdrama lovers and could definitely atrack non kdrama watchers.

A drama that teaches: You matter — whether alive or dead.
If dramas can be ranked according to the beauty their stories tell us, Move To Heaven would be one of the top ones. What a beautiful, heartbreaking depiction of loss and grievance over people considered as the discarded ones by most. Yet we learn that these people who might have not had anyone to mourn for them were loved too. Right from the first episode, this drama tugs at your heartstrings. Absolutely loved the depiction of Han Geuru’s parents. He shared such a beautiful bond with both of them and I’m so glad that he got to have his father with him for longer and know that he was loved. In fact Geuru had such wholesome bonds with everyone around him, it warmed my heart to see him loved and treasured instead of ostracised for his difference. It was so nice to see his bond develop with his uncle too. Uncle had a tragic past linked to him, and I wasn’t that huge a fan of how his arc was dealt in the last few episodes, but that’s okay since it’s not the major focus.

Spoilers below — talking about things that stood out in episodes:

Episode 1 — Such a gentle portrayal of father-son relationship, Han Jeong U was a special man whose empathy made him connect the dots on an emotional level. Perfect first episode to set the mode, what a sad introduction. Special mention: Lee Je Hoon’s wild look bad boy entrance.

Episode 2 — an episode that highlights children neglecting their elderly parents, Han Geuru is alone now, but does such a wonderful job in making sure the last message reaches the son.

Episode 3/4 — another interesting case, this one highlights one sided love. My most favourite thing was when Han Geuru keeps repeating that the stalker didn’t love the kindergarten teacher, it was the children who did. If he truly loved her, he wouldn’t have forced his presence on her and scared her. Such a simple but so powerful message in a sentence. Geuru repeating it felt like it was needed for us to know the difference between love and obsession.

Episode 5 — I would say this was my favourite episode in the series. So well written. The love, the characters, the ache, I don’t have enough words to describe. You need to watch it to feel it.

Episode 6 — another reflection of how the elderly are service are treated unfairly by most of the society. This was a very look in the mirror episode.

Episode 7/8 — these focus more on Uncle Sang-gu’s journey, his childhood, his relationship with the people he treasured, both are another set of heart wrenching episodes.

Episode 9 — In Matthew Green’s story we shed a light on a part of oversees adoption which took place in Korean history. I think I liked this best after episode 5. It made me wish for so many things, and the sadness stays with you.

Episode 10 — the final journey, of course it makes sense who the last person Move To Heaven will be sending off. It felt like all the growth that Han Geuru goes through over the last three months is reflected in his decision and how things are done. We also we plenty of heartwarming flashbacks that make you want to reach out and hug the characters. This episode ends with just enough space for a new season. I do hope we get one.

Spoilers end.
.
.
.
While there’s plenty of sadness in this series, I would not say it’s entirely heartbreaking. MTH leaves you with a feeling of healing. It tells you that these characters might have met death, but there’s more to their story. It provides each of them a beautiful closure which they couldn’t find in life. We as viewers mourn for all of them and remember them well. I really hope this is picked up for another season. We need more stories like these!

""Even the deceased can speak.""
The trailer itself was so good that I immediately added this to my list.

At first I thought that the drama is all about those people who died alone and isolating themselves from the rest of the world, just like what I saw on some Japanese documentaries. But the drama isn’t all about this, it tells more than what I imagined it to be. Trauma cleaners is indeed not an easy job and I deeply respect them for their work.

The calming cinematography fits the heartwarming story of the drama. But what I liked the most here is the amazing portrayal of each role of the cast with such an overwhelming delivery of emotion. Lee Je Hoon really captivates me. He’s really good on acting plus he’s so hot and handsome. I do also love Geu Ru’s super dad, a warm and kind hearted man that surely been a blessing to the people who knows him. The rest of the cast was really good on their roles specially to those cast who features every move to heaven story. Han Geu Ru and Na Mu were both a charming and loveable character that made the show livelier and more emotional.

I almost cried every episode but the scene that made me cry a lot was the brotherly love of Sang Gu and Jung Woo. The story behind the Nike shoes was so sad. Sang Gu is really a kind person and his character development was good.

Well-deserved high rating. It was not just an ordinary drama but it tells the real life story of those people who left the world with their final goodbyes to the things that connects into them. Such a heartwarming drama that I will never forget.

“Death tells a story and the things they left behind tells the story.”

Heart-wrenching, and healing
Best to go in blind with this one, but be warned it's very heavy. Based on the true stories of a trauma cleaner. Beautiful, beautiful storyline that hits particularly hard if you have experienced grief and can relate to the themes. It's a bittersweet mix of wholesome and heart-wrenching. Characters are wonderfully developed. Acting is amazing, especially by the lead, Gu Ru. The soundtrack is also gorgeous. I took off a point because some of the storylines were predictable and a little cliche.

Amazing how this show is like a form of therapy. The portrayal of some of the grief was just very real, I don't think I've cried so hard over a show before to the point I almost blanked out because it reopened some wounds and I had to take several breaks. I'm not sure I can rewatch this because it hits that deep. But don't let that deter you because the show is also healing and unforgettable. I hope there's a season 2.

First time doing a review because Move to Heaven is too good!
First time doing a review because Move to Heaven is too good!
It is a beautiful unique plot about funeral cleaning. I cried almost every other episode... and there are only 10 episodes, so that says something about the series.
The series depicts a lot of hardship and suffering we all face every other day and depicts them in the stories of each episode of ""trauma cleansing"". The series really knows how to tug on your heartstrings and make you cry, and just when you get enough of it, more feelings surge over like a tsunami all over you. The acting of the main lead as someone having Asperger syndrome is top-notch as well.
I'm only dissatisfied with the last scene which was weird and unnecessary but overall a masterpiece. Please watch this!

Heart-wrenching and heartwarming ❤️
When I watched the trailer, I knew I had to watch it but I kept delaying it. And finally! I watched it.
First of all, it's just 10 episodes and even if the duration was one hour each episode it passed really quick.
The storyline was refreshing for me. I haven't known that anything like trauma cleaning existed before I watched the drama. Each episode deals with death, grief, guilt and family.
Along with the main topic it also sheds light on different topics like adoption, nationality, LGBTQ community, etc .
The characters were very likeable. Ge-ru suffers with Asperger syndrome and is a literal genius. He loses both his parents and have to adjust living with his uncle. His characterization was done very well and Tang Joon-sang nailed the role.
Each member of the cast did their best. Acting was top notch.

The drama is heartwarming and heart-wrenching at the same time. Absolutely loved it❤️

A trip down to cry me a whole frigging river
I WAS FUCKING JOKING ABOUT THE DAD DYING AND THEN IT HAPPENED. Fucking move to heaven. I was like it's gonna be this sad depressive drama where the ml dad dies and then it happened. I'm like ..... I WAS SARCASTIC! Now me is crying. I'm not ready for another tear fest.

If Loyde, my friend who never binge watches kdramas, is already at episode 5 then it really must be good. I'm almost done with 3 and it's sooo good.

Also, that neighbour best friend is too hilarious, right away imagining uncle is up to fifty shade BDSM kink stuff while it's the opposite. She truly should be a fanfic writer with that naughty naughty mind. She naughty naughty.

It's surprisingly funny and sad in a beautiful way at the same time. I truly get why the actor who plays the uncle is like this is my favourite drama I've ever done.

THAT DAD OF THE BEST FRIEND IS SUCH A MOOD!

I love how they're atm the most unlikely three musketeers.

Noooo that's too sad that samchon has a traumatic past too.

The story about the kindergarten teacher is breaking my heart.

OMG CUTE BBY CALLING OUT THE MURDERER MADE ME EMO, PROUD AND I WAS LIKE SAY IT LOUDER! It was such a power move from him.

That friend is such a nancy drew, lol.

I'm at episode 5 now too and OMG I RECOGNIZED THAT DOCTOR FROM EP 5, HE WAS IN RECORD OF YOUTH and then he died ..... this is why we can't have nice things. Of course he had to die. Thank you move to heaven for making me even more sadder with your beautiful storytelling.

I hate how the best friend's mother really hates our precious pumkin.

I'm dying, I was like IT'S THE GUY for some reason. And somehow it truly was. This show has so much diversity and social commentary. This story has me soft, uwu, sad, emo at the same time. #crying. I hate homophobic parents, I hate homophobic society. They had no right to play with my emotions in this episode. They really destroyed me with this story. Fucking episode 5 man.

Pumkin sad because unlike his clients his dad didn't leave something like a message or present behind is making me sob.

SNSD Soo young's character was so sweet and truly the opposite of her character in run on.

Episode 7 is the saddest so far. Makes it even sadder that the character is played by one of my faves. This episode destroyed me.

Pumpkin playing poker with a couple of gangsters who just kidnapped him and slaying the game was too funny.

I don't know how they did it but episode 8 is even sadder than the one before.

JOKE IS ON US EPISODE 9 IS EVEN MORE SADDER. Also, soo-young is back again, yay. She's truly a beautiful person that character.

Samchon made fried eggs and pumkin be like SAMCHON ARE YOU DYING? That shouldn't have been funny and sad at the same time but it was. Lol, samchon swapping the egg with pumkin since his yolk was broken. Why am I crying so hard over that?

I forgot to mention but omg I so knew best friend didn't like pumkin purely platonic.

WHAHAHAHAHAHAHA EPISODE 10 IS ALSO FUCKING SAD.... AGAIN! It's the worst episode based on sadness because now I'm really sobbinggggg. It's all really beautiful sad. I still have 25 minutes left but I'm bawling my eyes out *continues to sob non-stop for the next 25 minutes* I haven't cried this hard since cloy.

Samchon crying about officially becoming pumkins forever guardian had me like same.

I could have done without the ending with the soon to die girl. I DID NOT LIKE THAT.

I'm so sad now. I'm definitely a pile of sad emptiness. My eyes really are all red and puffy.

I'm reading reactions and it's too funny since I'm not the only one who was an emotional mess, on an emotionally rollercoaster kdrama overfeeler for move to heaven. However, most people had the sob fest from episode 8 until the end, like one big sob fest while it was for me already from episode 5 and onwards, lol.

Something to learn in life
At first I didn’t have much thought of this drama but didn’t know how much this drama really have me going. This drama isn’t just about the lost of the love ones, but a struggling young boy with disabilities. And what breaks my heart even more, is seeing a young boy with disabilities losing both parents at the young age is heartbreaking. It must felt like the whole world just collapse, losing someone you love. This drama is heart warming, for everyone who haven’t watch this drama definitely give this a go. This drama is to teach us that someone else can also impact us by giving us hope, comfort and giving closures. And that family isn’t about blood but the people surrounding you are always family, never feel abandoned or lonely just because you’ve been abandoned. Just know you can also mean the whole world to someone else, Just remember “Those we love don’t go away they walk beside us everyday unseen, unheard, but always near”.

Thank you Netflix
Thanks to the recommendation from the Netflix i watch this masterpiece.
You know what is funny?? When i started it, i got a little bored at the first episode but because i am the type of person who give second chance i continued and it turn to be one of my most favorite dramas (not only kdramas)
I don't know from where to start ?!

Tear Jerker and a masterpiece
First of all I was very intrigued by the plot line of the story from the outset as it’s not everyday one sees death handled in the way Move To Heaven does it. In fact I didn’t even know a trauma cleaner was a job until this show. But by the end I completely understood it. Man this show made me bawl and I’m not much of an emotions person but the way that Geu-Ru was healed by the end and the character growth of Sang-Gu I was just enchanted.
If I had one criticism of the show it’s that Sang-Gu’s fighting ring was not really tied up neatly at all and honestly they should’ve just left it at the uncle letting go and trauma cleaning for his best friend and protege after the final fight. I’m going to go ahead and say that the mob doesn’t give up that easily and the uncle will have some trouble in the future which is why I just don’t think this plotline was all that necessary or tied up neatly. I thought Sang-Gu’s relationship and trauma from his upbringing with Jeong-Wu was good enough on its own though I understand the fighting ring stuff as it’s own separate thing I just think it was extraneous.
Other than that man this was great and I loved the tie in of social commentary such as the mall collapsing bc of the Olympics and capitalism as well as the adoption storyline which was just *chefs kiss* handled so well. Felt rlly personal and vulnerable then. Thank you Move To Heaven
I can’t and won’t comment on the realisticness of mental disability in this drama but I will say that I was at least impressed by the acting in this esp considering Tang Jun-Sang’s other roles I think it shows a real versatility.
Everyone should watch this show.

The Best K-Drama of 2021?
I am always hesitant to give a drama 10/10, because I'm afraid I'm not being objective. But I couldn't bring myself to give this drama anything below that. It has everything I ever wanted in a show, all the elements I like combined: strong and unique plot, complex characters with interesting relationships and character development, some action, non-perfect male lead that struggles and grows, and minimum to no romance.

I will start off by saying that the plot is truly unique, which is impressive, as these days it's difficult to be original since everything was done before. But this is my first time following a story of a troubled uncle and an autistic nephew that clean up deceased people's houses, learn their stories in the meanwhile, and grow close. Each episode also followed some new stories, which were all well-written with a deep and a meaningful message at the end of the heartbreak. The writer did a good job of making me invested in these characters that only appear for one episode - making me laugh for them, be angry at them, and cry for them.

This brings me onto my next point - the characters. They were all amazing, whether they were support roles or the main cast. I felt myself growing fond of many side characters, and no one felt out of place. I felt exactly what the writer/director wanted me to feel at all times, hated who they wanted me to hate and loved who they wanted me to love, which is a sign of a show written well. However, this also comes down to the actors and their realistic and beautiful portrayals of these characters. The casting was incredible (I mean, LJH was in it, come on now) and I liked the mix of well-known actors and rookies, all of which executed their roles perfectly. No character in the show was one-dimensional.

I loved the good-for-nothing uncle and his witty personality, his badass personality, sweet personality, and of course his amazing looks and sexy body.... I mean... his character development. The snarky comments were everything, and the way all his relationships developed had me smiling throughout the whole show like an idiot. I loved the autistic Gu Ru; he was just such a sweet, innocent cinnamon roll that I couldn't bring myself to ever be annoyed by him, but always wanted to protect him and hug him. I adored all his quirks, even the ones we were supposed to dislike. His stubborn nature, the way he would memorise everything and recite it like a computer, his naiveness and innocence which resulted in a very open-minded view of life, his inability to comprehend the situation and read the room which resulted in a lot of brutal honesty and shocked looks from others, as well all his facial expressions (even the blank ones), and all the times he would remind you hiw horrible lying is, and how you will end up being tortured in hell in horrible ways if you lie. Not to mention, how most of the time Gu Ru would be more of an adult that actual adults in the show. I also like Gu Ru's friend who was always supportive of him, understood him and his situation, as well as his illness, and always knew what was best for him. I liked her protectiveness of Gu Ru, and how she would take care of him. You will also notice that no character has stayed the same for the rest of the show ever since they first appeared, which is a big plus for me. The characters start out quite flawed, but that's exactly what leaves room for character development. We not only see them grow as people, we also see their relationships develop into something totally wholesome. Nevertheless, flawed or not, it's fun to watch these characters on their journey. We watch them laugh, cry, fight, and grow, and it feels like we're there with them.

Other than that, there's also other things that add on to the atmosphere of the drama. It's the little things that a lot of us won't even notice, but they end up enhancing our experience even more. The cinematography, the well-fitted music, the masterful camerawork. All of these things are done spectacularly well and immerse us into this amazing story. The humour of the show is one of those things as well. It's not over the top, and is meaningfully placed in all the right moments. It never ruins the immersion, which I find to be a problem in a lot of other K-Dramas, as it's brought about in all the right places, where it works really well in the story.

In conclusion, watch this drama. It's worth your time. You won't be bored. I never really enjoy life dramas, and always end up going for action, fantasy, thriller stuff with a more idealistic story. But this drama did it so well. It took all the life drama elements I hated, and turned it into something I absolutely adored. They made it entertaining to watch and follow. The drama tackled many societal issues, in a concise way, without making it feel like they were just dumping lots of wokeness on us. Usually, when shows tackle many issues at once, they end up doing it in a horribly messy way, and the message gets lost. Not this one. It felt as if we were learning along with the main characters.

All in all, this drama will definitely stay in my heart for a long time.

A gem
This drama is a must-watch of the year. Absolutely heartbreaking in a comforting way, just like life. Life is what it shows and tells: its pain, its unfairness, but also the comfort in memories, the uniquely human need of being loved and leaving a trace. It tackles social issues in a respectful way and never trying to preach, only stating facts. Each story told is deeply moving, encompassed in the main frame of the journey our protagonist Geu Roo takes towards remembering but letting go. The lenght of the drama is perfect, as well as the lenght of the episodes. The cast is incredible, the cinematography is beautiful. I'm glad I watched this.

A very touching story - a masterpiece drama
At first, I was a bit reluctant to watch this, as I thought it might be a horror drama, when someone told me it was about death. Then another friend, who was a fellow movie lover but rarely watches Korean drama, recommended me to watch this one with two thumbs up. There were only 10 episodes, and each episode was no more than an hour (40-60 minutes).

By then, I haven’t really moved on after watching Navillera, which to me was a beautifully-made drama on deeper issues unrelated to love and romance. Now here was another similar Korean drama. Yes, there was definitely love and romance in it, but not among the main leads. This was more like a family drama, but with many social issues added to it. This was a drama about stories untold by people who had left the world. It shows that each of us has a story to tell, but not always have the opportunity to do so.

Move to Heaven was inspired by a book ""Things Left Behind"" by Kim Sae-byul, who used to be a “trauma cleaner”, a professional job which I did not know existed before.

In the first episode we were exposed to a story of occupational hazards and a company that does not care. Then we were exposed to stories about Alzheimer's disease, elderly couples, suicide, parents who disapproved their gay son’s love relationship, domestic violence, child adoption and the search for one’s natural parents, deported Korean kids who returned and could not adjust to life in Korea, and illegal gambling and cheating.

But most of all this was a story of a father’s love towards his son, Geu-ru, who had special needs, and how he raised Geu-ru to become an independent, self-reliant person. It was also a story of a rude, uncaring, ex-convict uncle who came into Geu-ru's life, who eventually came to love his nephew so much (this somewhat reminded me of the movie My Annoying Brother).

At the end the whole drama was about learning to let go. Geu-ru was so concerned about other people’s lives and witnessed how they all had to let go of the past and move on. Eventually Geu-ru learned to do the same thing: learning to accept the loss of his father and to move on with his own life.

If there is one thing I’d like to criticise about this drama is that the whole story took place during the pandemic. The dates were specifically mentioned between April 2020 and July 2020, and yet none of the actors/actresses wore masks or kept physical distancing, not even in the hospital (and I think people in hospitals should really observe health protocols).

I know there were many dramas made during the pandemic, but since those stories was not time-bound, it doesn’t really matter. Start Up, for example, had a three-year lag in the story line. So we don’t really know (and don’t really care) in what year the story began and when it ended. This is also the same case with Lovestruck in the City, Run On, Hello Me and A Love So Beautiful. But Move to Heaven specifically mentioned dates which happened in 2020.

Anyway, this is an emotionally-touching drama. In fact, I could say it's a masterpiece. There were so many scenes which brought tears to my eyes, and yet it was not too melodramatic. I give my two thumbs up to the 17-year-old Tang Jun Sang who brilliantly played his role as Geu-ru. I’d like to see more of him in the future, and I’m sure he will be a great actor. Lee Je-hoon also played a great role as the obnoxious uncle.

This was the first drama to make me cry. Each episode brought new emotions. The acting in this show was incredible. The characters are portrayed very sincerely. I can't praise this show enough. I never felt bored while watching. In every episode there are lots of new characters that you learn about. Every story felt unique and heartwarming.

I hope there will be a second season as it has definitely been set up that way. The open ended final scene makes me think there will be another season. I hope to see more of some characters and there are some plot lines could be taken further.

All the characters had a lot of depth. I loved seeing the character development of both the main characters and guests. The show was paced very well, it revealed more about the characters each episode which changed my perception of them.

I highly recommend this drama. It is very well written and well acted. I hope to see a second season announced soon!

Outstanding
I can find no fault with this series. From writer, directors, technicians and throughout the whole cast, everyone has presented sterling work. My first 10.
The writer gives us an original concept, showing us lives and deaths of startling intimacy, and the director never overwhelmes these delicate and sometimes heart-rending stories. The development of the over-arcing plot, showing the process of each of the main characters as they deal with their own issues and build new relationships in the light of differing responses to loss, is delicate but powerful The acting is perfect throughout.
This is moving but not sentimental. It addresses many issues, some violence, some political matters, and, of course, loss. But it also raises a question - who exactly is most disabled here - and how should we defne or categorise disability? Is it to be pitied, or understood?
I often enjoy a drama but still find the pacing laboured. and yet this one was perfectly pitched. It CAN be done, Korea!
I cannot recommend this enough.

The Most Tear-Jerker and Painful But Healing K-Drama
I cried every episode! In fact, I'm still crying while writing this review... It's currently the top-rated drama on MyDramaList and I can see why. Move To Heaven deserves a 12/10 for that beautiful writing. I rated the rewatch value 1/10 because it is a heavy drama and I can only take much but don't get me wrong, Move To Heaven is the best K-Drama for me so far. Baeksang Arts Awards 2022, I swear if you snub Move To Heaven, Imma start a riot lol just kidding but they deserve every award out there. This is what storytelling should be and Move To Heaven delivered it!

Greater than a 10! Kudos!
This is an exceptional and phenomenal series that is not only riveting, but thought provoking, sensitive, and portrays the life of someone on the Autistic Spectrum with precision. Having worked in this field for decades, I was impressed with its accuracy. The story telling is unique and beautifully told. The characters are so noteworthy but in every sense of the word, absolutely relatable. This is must-see viewing Each story can stand on its own yet they are all a part of an entire picture. The warmth and growth each character displays, albeit on their own individual terms, is a thing of beauty to watch. You honestly care about these individuals and you want them to be themselves and accept the faults and short-comings of each other. That really is their story. This series is a masterclass in showing what humans really are. Flawed. Imperfect. Weak. Yet, capable of caring and loving each other on so many different levels despite the shortcomings. Kudos for a near perfect series.

IT IS AN UNDERRATED MASTERPIECE
I usually never prefer watching slow paced shows which have serious undertone linking to the meaning of life but this changed my mind I initially gave it a chance as it only had 10 episodes so like it could easily be watched and by the end I was dying for more episodes I loved how beautiful the execution of the characters were even the minor guest appearances side storyline was set up over a span of short duration, the stories of deceased not only felt real and touched your soul but it felt so personal at times you yourself find grieving over loses and feeling hopeless and specially the Geu-ru's character which was unique and for a 17 year old the actor played it gracefully and IDC HE DESERVES AND AWARD FOT IT.

The music was beautiful and felt soothing and refreshing and specially the direction was amazing it was beyond expectations how amazing this gem of a show is give it a try YOU WON'T REGRET IT BELIEVE ME I'm the kind of person who only watched rom com and non serious shits but this show has made a place deep in my heart!!

An Emotional Masterpiece
I don't even have the words to explain how amazing this drama was. It's far too perfect. After I heard about this coming I was excited and was definitely going to watch it because it sounded so unique and it really was unique. Then I heard that the portrayal of an autistic person was going to be stereotypical even though the drama hadn't even started and it made me rethink watching it but in the end it didn't stop me from watching it and as soon as day came and the drama was released I started watching it and I was blown away. At first I was annoyed that it was turning into every kdrama and I'm still annoyed that what happened, happened but it was needed for the drama, the drama wouldn't be what it is without it. Every episode was so unique and emotional and deep that I could just watch it all day and I can't even begin to explain my own feelings on the drama but it was beautiful and one of the best dramas I have watched in a long time. The character development was really satisfying. I'm not good at reviews or explaining my feelings on things but I promise you if you watch it you will not regret it.

Must watch !
Excellent! I'm now waiting for season 2 of this drama. Tang Jun Sang really portrayed the role of a boy with Asperger's syndrome. I loved the story so much. How the uncle and nephew grow to like each other . This drama even has a lots of funny scenes too. This drama give you both humour and tears. The Cameos are amazing too. I'm in love this all the three casts. I'm waiting for it so badly .
Thank you~
Hope it helps :)

AN AMAZING DRAMA
This drama left me in an emotional wreck after watching it ...

As someone who had recently lost a loved one, I knew i had to prepare myself to watch such an emotionally taxing drama. But once i watched it, i have no regrets at all because it was such a beautiful drama from the colour palettes to the cinematography to the stories that each character had to tell, be it the main/supporting/cameo characters... In fact after watching, i felt like i had received healing from it and learned a few important life lessons. (such as we must give time to allow ourselves to feel and to grieve before moving on)

Each episode has a main story to tell, a character that died and the after effects of it. From the people who find them, to their loved ones and family, even to those seemingly insignificant passer-bys that were a part of their daily lives. My favourite episode was the one with the cellist and also near the end in ep 8, 9, 10... i BAWLED my eyes out so hard. The scene with the shoes got me real good....

Lee Je Hoon is one of my favourite korean actors and he is somehow able to pull off that sloppy uncle character that you cant help but like. He is flippant and lazy which irritates you but then later you will fall for his character as his backstory is revealed and its so crazy at how much emotional turmoil he was hiding away. The acting in this drama was phenomenal and the way Asperger's was represented was also done really well too. (maybe except the main female character whose only other show i watched her in was Navillera as her acting is still a bit awkward and loud). The music score in this drama was also a treat to the ears...

Often times, society has a hard time dealing with the topic and talking about death. And the fact that this drama was able to do it in such a sensitive and delicate manner just blew my mind. Overall, would watch this again maybe once in a while if im in the right mood for it

Would highly recommend everyone to watch this at least once in your life!!!

better than what i expected
as a universe, i only started watching it because of hongseok (he was the police btw)

it was so so so much better than what i expected.

it amazes me since i never thought this kind of service existed you know? and the gue ru's acting was super good. i like how it really shows that just because you are autistic, doesn't mean that you aren't able to contribute anything in life and doesn't mean that you need others help literally 24/7.

now now lets talk abaout lee je hoon here.
his acting was INSANELY GOOD. i didn't realise that he was the same person who acted in where stars land at all. his duality, and acting was SUPER GOOD. his acting range is really wide indeed. i still can't move on from in. salute to him.

this drama touches on things ive never even thought before. i really like in one episode it touches about lgbt love also. i like everything about this drama. its one tear-jerker drama, which teaches you stuff that i dont think any other dramas does.

to think that i only watched this because of my boy hongseok, this is really much better than i expected. give it a try!! it suitable to watch it with your family too

~Beautiful take on life and death, grief and closure, love and regret.
~The concept of the show “trauma cleaning” is heartbreaking but therapeutic at the same time.
~It is an absolute cry fest especially towards the second half of the show. (Get your tissue box ready)
~Involves little romance and comedy
~Very interesting stories in each episode and tackles sensitive issues related to Asperger’s syndrome, same-sex love, aging parents etc.
~Exceptional acting by the leads

*Rewatch Value: Low (just because I can’t go through the bawling and crying again sigh)

I cried each episode. Lol.
This drama was one of the best I've seen in a very long time.
I tend to drop dramas a lot if it's not captivating or drags on but each episode touched my heart one way or another. It really made me reflect on bits of my own life and learn about what others may be going through as well.
Each main character was super likeable in their own way and you can see the growth as the drama goes on.
If you need a good cry this drama is for you.

The only reason I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 was because of the last 5mins... butttttt all in all amazing drama.

Tear-jerking
Every sub-story has its own significant meaning and the build-up was great with gradual progress in the casts' character developments.

I would like to commend on the 2 main casts, Lee Je Hoon (Sang Gu) and Tang Jun Sang (Geu Ru). The way they portray the characters are incredible, especially Geu Ru's character, and helps to better deliver the intended message of the storyline to the audience.

This drama has a heart-warming story plot and highly recommended to watch if you want to sob.
Watch the story unfolds [hint: to know the story behind the main casts] as I was really engaged in the last 1/2 episodes.

I feel that this drama strikes a chord with many of us as it is very relatable to our lives, teaches us to embrace deaths of our loved ones and move on. Most importantly, it reminds me to cherish my current loved ones and not have regrets in future.

Worth to Watch
I didn't expect much when I started watching it. As I continued to watch every episode, it was such an emotional journey to watch. I am glad to have seen it. It was worth every second of every minute of every episode from start to finish. As someone who lost a loved one, it was a challenge to watch but it helped me process my grief and be able to move on and let go of the pain I had in my heart.

I wish and hope that there will be a second season. Should there be a second season, I can't imagine anyone else replacing the cast. I do hope that they will keep most, if not, all of the original cast members. It was beautifully well-written. I loved the character development of all characters.

Wow. As everyone has mentioned, this show was beautiful, it was touching, emotional, a bit of comedy here and there. It revolves around a son with Asperger's syndrome, that can't let go of his Dad. That's the main story, but the show is also based on a case-to-case basis where they do trauma cleaning for each deceased in each episode. Geu-ru was raised by the nicest parents, nicest dad ever, and he grew up to be a nice and kind guy too. It's beautiful to see. Then comes the Uncle who is involved in illegal gambling/boxing where he accidentally kills his best friend that's like a bro to him. Then we have the next door girl who has a crush on Geu-ru, Na-mu. Bubbly and cute girl, after Navillera, Seunghee did a great job. Jun Sang and Je Hoon did a great job acting here as well, the emotions especially Ji Jin Hee, wow. I didn't cry as much as I thought I would, but it's undoubtedly a very emotional and slice-of-life drama. Judging from the vague open-ending with Lee Re appearing, I think we can say we should have a Season 2, NETFLIX DO YOUR JOB. Also, seeing that 'Madam' got out safely, I think she still is planning something. I'll be waiting for my season 2, Netflix. This show was a 10/10.

prepare tissues before watching
wow where to start? this was incredible. it was so moving and touching. it made my heart ache in the best way possible.

story: it's a bit episodic. each episode you get to basically know about another dead person but it also has a more continuous narrative. things like the build up to understanding why sang gu and his brother's relationship was strained and the development of a familial relationship between sang gu and geu ru. the plot has many messages that make us think about human nature. it's heartbreaking because of how real it is. this was so well written and it shows us the flaws and mistakes humans make as well as the many hopes and dreams we all have.

acting: simply wow. i have no words for how well acted this drama is. every actor played their part perfectly. they captured these characters to the very core. lee je hoon's performance as sang gu was beautifully potrayed. he showed the character's flaws, strengths and weaknesses in a way no other actor could've done. tang jun sang who played geu ru very well done. his portrayl of someone who has asperger's imo is very good. the other actors were of course amazing as well. they managed to play their characters in a way that felt real and personal. well done to the cast, seriously well done.

music: ep 5 :( gonna cry everytime i hear ""we wish you a merry christmas"".

rewatch: i actually rewatched some episodes to cry because i couldn't cry lmao. it worked btw. great if you wanna cry not great if you dont lmao.

overall: this is a masterpiece. it gives us a glimpse into the lives of others. a hard working man who is taken advantage of, an old couple who want to be together till the end, how greed can cloud a person's mind, a couple who never got to be because of parental pressure and prejudice, and how a misunderstanding can cause years of resentment. there's of course more than just the things i've listed (some with more meaning that what i've put lol) so watch it to find out.

it shows how society views death (and trauma cleaners) as something taboo despite it being something that happens everywhere everyday. death isn't really the end. people leave things behind. what their hopes, dreams and unfufilled wishes were.

each episode has a message behind it. some make you frustrated, some make you hope and some will just make you sad. it charges head first into criticizing society, its controversial issues and prejudice. it really makes you think about a million things and feel a million things. one of the best dramas i have ever seen.

refreshing..
Despite their being trauma cleaners, I actually found this drama very refreshing. I loved the visuals, the drone shots....

Kdramas are truly unique. They have so many original stories which can be eye openers for foreign viewers.
I loved the idea of having these trauma cleaners. For people who have experienced losses, it is truly difficult to go through a loved ones belongings because of all the memories they evoke.

Though this series was short, it showed a different side of loss. In their words, the deceased could speak and tell their stories. True enough, everything they leave behind, be it receipts, old bills etc, can easily tell a story of how they live their daily lives.

This is a recommendable drama the whole family can enjoy

A heartwarming drama that shows the best of humanity
A touching, beautiful, somewhat magical and heartwrenching drama that played every one of my heartstrings as though it were a melody. Each episode filled with touching and heartbreaking stories of the deceased; and the powerful, warming journey a young boy with autism goes through to not only give peace to those deceased but to give them the final farewell they deserve.

Han Geu Ru, a 20-year-old boy with autism has never had an easy life, he struggles with new challenges and anything outside his set rules. Han Geu Ru's life takes on an even sadder and tragic twist with the sudden death of his father. Having found himself placed into the care of his uncle, a complete stranger fresh out of prison and his childhood friend and neighbour. Together an unlikely and beautiful relationship is formed between Han Geu Ru and his uncle, who once despised Han Geu Ru's father due to a misunderstanding a long time ago.

After a few misunderstandings and incidents, Han Geu Ru comes to trust and love his uncle as a second father, while his uncle learns more about life and the true meaning of it. Through one another the two men grow a strong, unbreakable and loving bond that brings tears to the audience.

An absolute heartwrencher and tearjerker, but it leaves an important message for the audience about life, family and dreams. 'We must always live in the present and not in the past.'

I am very glad to have been able to watch this masterpiece and am grateful to see such an emotional and touching drama. The cast were absolutely phenomenal and played their characters perfectly. What great actors they were to be able to play their characters so well and evoke such emotion and reactions from the audience. A true pleasure to watch.

Piece of art!
Move to heaven is a story about a boy who has asperger, he and his father used to work as people who are trauma cleaner. When his father one day died, he got a new guarden, his uncle and his fathers half brother. The relationship with the uncle and the father will you know about in the drama and the reason why they aren't close.

The acting in this drama was the best ever, Tang Jung-Sang did an amazing job and showed every emotion and act perfectly. The show will give you a reason to live and show you what life is like. That there will be misunderstandment, that things will go wrong. In this show, you will learn that every person in the world is worthy, even tho they migh have a type of syndrome, even if you aren't ""normal"". You will have a beautiful ride through every episode. Every episode will bring something new and intresting. The show also shows how people can fall apart but love each other still, toxiety in a family or in a relationship. It will show you that you are worth of living, that even if you think no one will care, there will always be someone who will get hurt and that it just needs someone to speak up for you to get along. Because someone maybe to do so.

The drama will bring up different stories of different people. And everything will be very touching. It was beautifully directed and produced. Everything was pefectly made.

I'm grateful that I gave this drama a chance. I watched it once before but I dropped it (It was when I was in need of some romance drama cuz I watched to many sad ones). I learned many things and got so happy because it feels like the show made me a better type of person. I cried on every episode, every scene and I'm not lying. I was seriously bawling but that may be cuz I'm a crybaby. The drama was a 10/10. I highly recomend it, worth every second of your time.

Speaker for the Dead meets Rain Man
TL;DR: Move to Heaven is special, go watch it. We need season two. Now.
The longer version: Let's try to keep it short before it turns into a postgrad thesis.
MtH doesn't hit dramatic highs but it works slowly and steadily to breakdown your emotional defence until you can't help but be touched by the many emotional moments presented by the show. On the other hand, it is not a non-stop tear jerker either. How the narratives affects you will depend on your background and your EQ. Have tissues handy, you have been warned.
It tells simple stories of people who have passed away and became clients of this specialist cleaning company. Each short story was handled touchingly and delicately. Their lives seemed mundane on the surface but that was the whole point of the show. These cleaners do more than just clean and pack up the belongings of the deceased. The father and son team have the knack of seeing beyond the flotsam and jetsam of a person's life and see some of their essences and what was their last unfinished task. Their goal is to try to complete that task on their behalf and bring closure to people closest to them, in a sense, they are the speakers for the dead. Along the way, the show touched on many societal ills such as domestic violence, bullying, elderly neglect, etc. They are not unique to Korea but they are certainly prevalent.
The show is almost perfect but not quite. The writer can be too clever and withheld information from the viewers and then did the big reveal and tell you what the clue was after the fact. Most of the heavy lifting was done by the young ML who has Asperger's but also a savant . While he is surrounded by a very supportive found family, they don't seem to do a lot other than bicker among themselves or provide the contrary views to move the plot along and for which the ML debunks as par for the course. It is not quite an ensemble cast in that sense. The uncle's cage fighting and back story added a nice action component and complexity to his character. However, some misunderstanding that lasted for years was too easily resolved in the end.
Speaking of back stories. The show was arranged sort of back to front so the show started with the forced cohabitation of basically strangers and the second half of the show revealed their complicated back stories via lots of flash backs (have tissues handy) and explained how their lives were changed. It worked quite well but the problem we have here is that the show felt like it came a full circle and then it ended. If it was the standard 16 episodes, it could have ended properly. In the 10 episodes we got, we got revelations, character growth, some closures and everything was in place for the show to go forward but it just stopped. There were hints of budding romances, the cleaning company was finally on solid footings, an antagonist that was set for revenge, even a curious new job offered in the dying minutes of the show. If that does not hint at a second season I don't know what does. Please, please give us another season. We besiege you, Old Mighty Netflix!

A touching story that doesn't leave a single eye dry.
This is probably the most Jdrama-ish Kdrama I've seen and I'm saying that with only positivity in my mind.

An emotional tale that will make you cry in about every episode.

When you die, do you think that you will disappear?
This drama will tell you the answer. That even if you are gone, pieces of you are left behind with the people that cared about you. Your belongings will tell about your life, your last time on this earth. It will show your struggles, your hopes and dream. And no matter how alone you think you are, when you are gone, there will be someone that misses you and grieves for you. Even when you are not here, you will never truly be gone.

The main cast is an interesting bunch as well. A dad that is the greatest dad in the world, a son that is special but because of that, he can see things no one else can. An uncle that is broken, but is beginning to heal. And the next door neighbour that is pretty much family.
All of these are part of what makes this drama great. Their story, their grief and their hopes and dream as well as their work as trauma cleaners.

10 episodes filled with lots of emotions and a different view on life. Here's to another season with more stories, both sad and happy.

Can't recomend this drama enough, a hidden jewel on Netflix
I'll say I'm not on the Asparger syndrome spectrum, but I'm glad there is a show with a main character that is.

S. Korea has good dramas, but since ""while you were sleeping"" there hadn't been a drama that grabbed me that hard like ""move to heaven"". Every episode was unique on its own and made me cry. There story is well written and I liked the arc both Geuru and Sanggu (especially Sanggu). The stories were varied and it was great, I enjoyed crying every every time. Nothing feels repetitive. I feel like the story is perfectly finished, I don't need a second season.

The acting was good even from supporting cast and Tang Jun Sang is definatly on my list of stars to watch for their next project. As I mentioned, I'm not on the spectrum, so that's not something I can judge, but he clearly stepped into a role that's not easy and he did good job at it IMO.

I like the fact that unlike many dramas, the show didn't use catchy Kpop songs. Don't get me wrong- I LOVE those songs, drama are my only way to be exposed to new great songs. But in this drama I think it actually works with classic music in the background.

I'll admit I didn't understand the last scene- what do white butterflies represent in Korea? (not a spoiler cuz... I'm going to tell in what context they were).

I think the drama is worth watching and I want to tell everyone about it. If I had Youtube channel, I would make a video of how much I loved it.

I don't believe in heaven but I believe in this drama ?
Ok.. so as someone who is pretty much just now branching off of the BL genre, this is the first review I've done on just a regular K-drama. Normally when I watch a drama that isn't BL, it has to be related to something I enjoy. For example, Horror/Thrillers. That's why I really enjoyed Strangers from Hell and Sweet home. But this is pretty much the first time that I ignored all those things and went for something I wasn't even sure I was gonna like lol. Tbh, when I first read the synopsis it made me really confused how this is ranked #1 on the top dramas list. I thought it sounded quite boring. How could a drama about moving peoples things be good? Damn.. I was WRONG. To me, this drama was anything but boring. Not only is pretty much every single character likeable but its exactly what it says it is, a freaking tearjerker. I cried in almost every episode. It was cool to see the lives and stories of the dead. Especially when typically people just end up forgetting them. It definitely also had lots of comedy, happiness, suspense, action... just everything. I wasnt sure how I felt about the uncle at first just cause he seemed to be really petty but he grew on me super hard and ended up becoming one of my favorite characters. His slowly developed relationship with Geu-ru was so perfectly executed. Geu-ru is also an extremely likeable character. Hes so smart, talented, and very high functioning. I know that one of the symptoms of Asperger syndrome is that people with it seem to lack emotional expression and yes, maybe Geu-ru didnt physically show his emotions much but he definitely expressed his emotions through his actions and words. The things he would go out of his way to do for people was insane. I seriously cant get over how good this series was. I will be rewatching it again soon lol. Im grateful for everyone involved in this drama.

Amazing story and acting
I have to admit that Geu Roo is so adorable. It was sad that he lost his father. Geu is a smart guy who was able to continue the business. Those crime scenes he was cleaning would freak me out. Who does not get freak out being around that? I admire how the actor playing Geu Roo handle it so well. I would just scearm and be like this is not a job for me. The story is amazing and a must watch series. BTW there is episode that has BL scenes. If you have not watch it. You have to see it for yourself.

A very heart-touching drama with a unique plot-line.
Move To Heaven একটা প্রফেশনাল ট্রামা ক্লিনিং অরগানাইজেশান। ‘ট্রামা ক্লিনিং’ টার্মটা কিভাবে বোঝাই……… খুব বিচ্ছিরি একটা উদাহরণ দিয়ে বোঝাতে হচ্ছে! আমাদের দেশে করোনা সংক্রমণের শুরুর দিকে একদল স্বার্থপর মানুষের দেখা মিলেছিলো- তাদের বৃদ্ধ মা-বাবা কিংবা আত্মীয় স্বজন কেউ মারা গেলে তারা লাশ রেখে পালিয়ে যেত, লাশ ধরতে অস্বীকৃতি জানাতো। তখন আবার আরেকদল স্বেচ্ছাসেবক দলের দেখাও মিলেছিলো যারা নিজ উদ্যোগে এসব লাশ যথাযোগ্য মর্যাদায় দাফন করতে আসতো। Move To Heaven নামের প্রতিষ্ঠানটাকে আমরা এসব স্বেচ্ছাসেবক দলের সাথে তুলনা করতে পারি, কিন্তু তারা কাজটা প্রফেশনালি করে। তবে পার্থক্য হচ্ছে তারা মৃতদেহ সৎকার করে না, মৃতজনের ব্যবহৃত জিনিসপত্রাদি যা তাদের প্রিয়জনদের প্রয়োজন নেই বা যেসব জিনিসপত্র থেকে গেলে সেগুলোর স্মৃতি মনে করে প্রিয়জনরা কষ্ট পেতে পারে তারা সেগুলোর সৎকার করে। সহজ ভাষায় বলতে গেলে, পৃথিবীর বুক থেকে মৃতজনের সর্বশেষ স্মৃতিটুকু সরিয়ে নেয়ার কাজটাই Move To Heaven করে থাকে, যাতে জীবিতরা সব ভুলে আবার নতুন করে বাঁচতে পারে। এটাই ট্রামা ক্লিনিং।
আমাদের গল্পের নায়ক Han Geu Ru আর তার বাবা Han Jung Woo মিলে এই Move To Heaven নামক প্রতিষ্ঠান চালায়। তাদের কাজ ট্রামা ক্লিনিং হলেও তারা সবসময় চেষ্টা করে মৃতজনের অন্তিম চাওয়াটা পূরণ করতে। এটা মৃত জনের প্রতি তাদের সম্মান প্রদর্শনের নিদর্শন। এভাবেই চলছিলো সব ঠিকঠাক। কিন্তু একদিন সব এলোমেলো হয়ে গেলো।
নায়ক Han Geu Ru ২০ বছরের তরুণ হলেও সে কিছুটা মেন্টালি চ্যালেঞ্জড, মানে অটিস্টিক আরকি। বাবাই ছিল তার দুনিয়া। কিন্তু একদিন তার বাবা হুট করেই মারা গেলো। অথৈ সাগরে পড়ল Geu Ru। এমন সময় দরজায় কড়া নাড়ল জেল ফেরত এক আগুন্তক, So Sang Gu। সম্পর্কে সে Geu Ru-এর সৎ চাচা, যার কথা Geu Ru জীবনেও কোনদিন শুনে নি। কিন্তু তার আর কোন আত্মীয় স্বজন না থাকায় সে-ই এখন তার লিগ্যাল গার্ডিয়ান।
পুরো পরিস্থিতিটা নিয়ে মোটেও খুশি নয় Yoon Na Mu, সে Geu Ru-র প্রতিবেশি, চাইন্ডহুড ফ্রেন্ড এবং তার প্রতি খানিকটা ক্রাশিতও! Sang Gu কে মোটেও পছন্দ হলো না তার। চেহারায় কেমন যেন গুন্ডা গুন্ডা ভাব, সারাদিন শুধু সিগারেট খায়। Gue Ru-র গার্ডিয়ানশিপ এমন একটা লোকের কাছে যাওয়ায় মোটেও খুশি হতে পারলো না Na Mu। তাই সে সিদ্ধান্ত নিল এখন থেকে সেও Move To Heaven এ কাজ শুরু করবে। আর গোপনে Sang Gu-র প্রতি নজর রাখবে যাতে সে কোন ভাবেই যেন Geu Ru-র কোন ক্ষতি করতে না পারে।
আর Geu Ru-র গার্ডিয়ানশিপ নেয়ার ব্যাপারে চাচা Sang Gu-র উদ্দেশ্যও খুব একটা ভালো ছিলো না। তার সৎ ভাই মানে Geu Ru-র বাবার প্রতি তার অনেক ক্ষোভ ছিলো। তাই সে এখানে গার্ডিয়ান হিসাবে আসলেও তার মূল উদ্দেশ্য হচ্ছে Geu Ru-র সব সম্পত্তি বাগিয়ে নেয়া। কিন্তু উইলের শর্তানুযায়ী গার্ডিয়ানশিপ পাওয়ার জন্য তাকে তিন মাস Geu Ru-র সাথে Move To Heaven এর কার্যক্রম চালাতে হবে। এরপরেই সে স্থায়ীভাবে গার্ডিয়ান হিসাবে মনোনীত হবে।
এভাবেই এই তিন জনকে নিয়ে শুরু হলো Move To Heaven এর নতুন যাত্রা। এই যাত্রা কখনো আপনাকে হাসাবে, কখনো কাঁদাবে আর কখনো বা আবেগে ভাসাবে। কিন্তু এক মূহুর্তের জন্যেও বিরক্ত হতে দেবে না।
৪৫ মিনিট করে প্রতি এপিসোড, ১০ এপিসোডের নেটফ্লিক্স অরিজিনাল মিনি সিরিজ। প্রচন্ড ইমোশনাল একটা ড্রামা। হ্যাপি আর স্যাড এন্ডিং বলে এখানে কিছু নেই, ঘটনার নিত্য প্রবাহ আছে। প্রতিদিনই নতুন কোন গল্পের জন্ম, পুরোনো কোনো গল্পের শেষ। যারা ফ্যামিলি বা লাইফ জনরা পছন্দ করেন তাদের জন্য মাস্ট ওয়াচ এই সিরিজ।

This is a drama which don't get high popularity like other stars but it is a masterpiece. I randomly watched this drama but I ended up loving it. Nothing extra all were intact to subject. A beautifully conveyed that every person is unique. Never judge anyone based on their sickness and treat them as patients. Instead treat them as they are unique in their own way.
The message conveyed in the drama is very beautiful. I wish more dramas of this kind are made. Importance of every life is showed very wisely. I would recommend everyone to watch this drama. It is emotional and You wont regret watching it. This drama relaxes your mind and soul. Not a romantic drama but a meaningful one. Overall a very good drama.

This one deserves the hype
I would say this isnt a typical Kdrama its clear that its netflix made. But the acting and story are so great I didnt really notice.
I would recommend this to non Kdrama fans as it is just a great show.

As always Le Je Hoon is amazing, he is like a chameleon in all of his roles, completely nailed this character.
Unlike the garbage fire which is 'It's Okay not to be Okay' the portrayal of Aspergers here is handled with sensitivity, allowing the character to have depth and be more than just someone with Aspergers.
Even though each episode usually handles a death it doesnt feel melodramatic, it is interesting and touching. There are many bittersweet moments but there are also a lot of funny and lighthearted moments.

Basically a great show!

I cried every episode...
This series is an emotional rollercoaster with a incredible story, cast and message.

The Plot:
The drama surrounds a boy, Han Geu Ru, with autism. After his father dies, he has to take over their company ""Move to Heaven"" with deals with estate regulation after a person dies. His neighbour and best friend Yoon Na Mu gives him a helping hand. However, due to his illness, Han Geu Ru gets a new legal guardian, which was chosen by his father before he died. It is his uncle Cho Sang Gu who just got released from prison after almost killing somebody in a fight.

The Obstacles:
All the characters need to overcome past and present barriers to get along with each other. Geu Ru has to work on his strictness, Sang Gu needs to learn to release past anger and guilt, and Na Mu needs to find out what she really wants in life.
But when they grow together, a beautiful family emerges.
There were a lot of side stories, which helped the characters growing. It always brought tears to my eyes how caring they dealt with the estate of the dead people, how they introduced themselves to them and how they did not give up to find the person they can give the important stuff to.

The Cast:
Tan Jung Sang aka. Geu Ru did an brilliant job in portraying a character with a disease. He perfectly portrayed the smart, introverted and caring character and transferred me to another world.
I've recently seen Hong Seung Hee in Navillera, and she was the completely opposite of her character there. She seemed way younger, bubbly and fast-forward. Her character had the function to always speak out loud what the audience things. Otherwise, she was a caregiver and the person who always took the chance and operated to make everyone's life better. She was very fun to watch.
Lee Je Hoon had a huge change here. I only knew him from romantic comedies, but he depicted the ex-prisoner and violent poor boy from the streets very well. I think he definitely liked diving into that role. He played amazingly with his emotions, the sadness, anger and also warmth.
All of them were truly mesmerizing, and I am looking forward to seeing many of their new projects in the future.
Thanks to all the people who worked hard on this series. Amazing screenwriting, directing and acting, etc.

The ending opens some questions, so it might be possible that there will be another season.

Get ready to sob. I cried in pretty much every episode while watching this drama. I felt so bad for Geu Roo in the beginning but I was glad that he had people that loved him and helped him with his loss, even if the help might've been an ass in the beginning. His uncle, Sang Koo, was very immature and was only taking care of him for the benefits but he learned a lot while working with Geu Roo and started to understand what the family business was about. Each client that they had revealed another sob story that really gets you thinking about life. This was such a good drama but it would honestly be too painful to rewatch too often so I gave it a rewatch value of 8/10. I'd probably rewatch this when I need a good cry but I couldn't see myself rewatching this often.

A drama about listening
As I was writing the title to this review (this is my first time reviewing so I was rather lost) I was reminded of one of the repeating lines “even the deceased can speak” and generally that was what this drama showed.
Every episode showed a different story and brought light to the stories that normally would have disappeared. They touched upon disability, elderly people in society, the lgbtq community, overseas adoption, domestic abuse, suicide, industrial mismanagement and exploitation, prison, and more, I probably have forgotten some of the societal issues shown as there were so many. In showing the stories of these characters they showed the humans behind these issues, their individual stories, the consequences, and those left behind. In every episode, they not only told the untold stories of those dead but the stories of those who would not be heard even alive.
It was sad but happy at the same time. Some were more tragic than others cause you couldn’t help but think how different things could be so easily, but all of them felt heard and that was a kind of bittersweet happiness through the series.
The cast really brought to life every character within this, even outside of the main cast the level of acting was consistent which really gave depth to each story told. While I do not feel informed enough to give an assessment of how accurate the representation of autism is in this (and am aware that many people would prefer an autistic character to be played by an autistic actor), as someone likely on the autistic spectrum (undiagnosed) I thought it was reasonably well done.
Finally, the ending felt cathartic and right. It was neither happy nor sad and that really fit. It felt like the entire series had been leading to that final move to heaven which gave the entire drama a nice direction and wrapped up point to stop. We ended where we started and heard the story we started with end. Though there was a hint at a season 2 which I fully can see working and would support (with the girl at the end, and the fighting ring owner escaping arrest).
Overall, while I don’t believe this is one I would rewatch because the impact was truly in the piecing together of the story, and the finding what the dead wanted to say (I do not tend to rewatch things in any case as I remember the story enough after the first watch that I get bored). This is a must watch because this drama shows the stories of the dead (fictional of course but easily applicable with how grounded in reality the series is), but also what the alive unheard by society say.

Like a Yellow Box, All of the Important and Beautiful Elements Can Be Found in this Series!
""Move to Heaven"" is a little gem of a series that is fulfilling and uplifting in its short 10-episode story arc. The show is like a yellow box that has all of the important things in it, leaving nothing out, and putting no extraneous or unnecessary plot devices into it.

The story is about trauma cleaners. Don't know what trauma cleaners are? Neither did I until I watched the show. Trauma cleaners are hired to go into a deceased's dwelling and clean it. Sometimes, it is not very glamorous, especially if the body of the deceased has been there for an extended period of time. But the key element of the job is to collect those important and necessary items that the deceased has left behind and give them to a relative or someone who was important to the person who died.

Han Geu-ru--who is masterfully portrayed by Tang Joon-Sang and should win every actor award that he's nominated for--is a 20-year-old boy with Asperger's Syndrome who is gifted with unique and special insight. Not only is he able to remember anything with a momentary glance, he is able to piece things together in order to learn more about the person who died. Of course, Geu-ru's world is strictly ordered, and any deviation from that order brings him into hysterics.

After his father suddenly dies from a heart condition, Geu-ru is put into trial custody under his uncle, Cho Sang-Gu, a man who's just gotten out of prison and is an ex-MMA fighter. Cho Sang-Gu is rough around the edges, to say the least, and the last thing he is initially interested in, is taking care of a nephew he doesn't give a hoot about from a brother he hated and despised. Part of the beauty of the story is in how these two grow closer together.

Move to Heaven reminds me a little bit of ""Highway to Heaven."" It seems like the kind of show Michael Landon would have done. The show runs much deeper than two men packing up items. In each episode, we learn how the deceased lived. There are some truly though-provoking stories of people--who may seem unremarkable--but end up being remarkable in their own, unique ways, that in real life, might not garner much attention. But we quickly learn the invaluable truth"" Every life is precious. And every life has a story to tell.

Don't be surprised if a number of episodes has you reaching for a tissue or a hanky. There are many beautiful moments that will have you doing just that!

The story implores people to think about how they treat others. To think about what is really important. We see our share of greedy, selfish, and vindictive people who clearly don't give a hoot about their fellow man. Even when that fellow man is a relative. The story begs us to prioritize and remember, not only WHAT is really important in life, but WHO!

I was more than happy to see that the writers seemed to leave the door open for a second season. Ten episodes went by a little too quickly for me. But it's also a series that I loved so much that it invites repeated viewings.

In short, the world desperately needs more shows like this one!

A warmth teary story
Story - the story is not new to me because of the same story of Good Doctor who has Asperger syndrome acted by Han Geu Roo (Tang Jung Sang). But difference is it depicts about the death of the people maybe on traumatic case or sadden death. I like the story behind because it may be hurtful to loose someone but it gives hope and let you understand that death its just the beginning. You will cry but then it will put smile in your heart. Heart warming stories of each episode.

The main role Han Gae Roo who portray his role very well. It convince me to the syndrome he has. But of course the uncle Lee Je Hoon (Cho Sang Gu) of course we know how great he is with his acting. Yoon Na Mu (Gong Seung Hee) was really funny in the drama that make it more lighter in the story.

A heartbreaking show about life, death, and everything in between!
Move to Heaven is a beautiful, well-written show about death, grief, and regrets that’s well worth the watch. I am a sucker for Slice of Life shows done right, and this one hit all the right spots for me.

Before I delve into all the positives, I must say that I did expect a bit more of an emotional impact after reading the synopsis. I thought the show would give us something truly heartbreaking and healing, which I did not get to the extent I was anticipating. I also wanted to see more of the uncle-nephew interaction. I wanted to see them meld and fit with each other like a family jigsaw, but somehow I was slightly let down with the dialogues, scenes, and interactions we got. Also, the side characters were pretty one-dimensional, like the neighbor girl and the fight ring boss lady. Maybe my expectations were sky-high after reading the positive reviews this drama was getting. My advice would be to go in expecting nothing, and you will be moved to tears by this drama.

Coming to the positives of the drama -

The various stories are the best part of this show. They are beautifully written, realistic and heartbreaking. Within the span of one episode, you get to experience how one of the clients lived their lives, what really mattered to them, empathize with them, and grieve for their death. The stories are real enough that you might easily know someone like that in your life, and it makes you reflect on how you have been living your life and who you might want your box to go to, and what might be in it.

The show also shows a lot of respect for death and life. The parts when they bow to the deceased before the start of their job and the care they show to the belongings that might not mean much to anyone else was respectful and nice to watch.

Move to Heaven also explores and handles several different controversial social and societal conditions ranging from domestic abuse, child abuse, mental health, overseas adoption, care for the elderly, working conditions of low-wage workers, same-sex relationships, etc., with realness and delicate sensibility.

Sang Gu - the uncle’s story was the most interesting to me. His history with child abuse, his relationship with his brother and the betrayal he felt, the backstory of his cage fighting days and his relationship with his young apprentice, and how he began healing piece by piece after living and working with Geu Roo at Move to Heaven. I also felt that throughout the show, Sang Gu was the only one who didn’t treat Geu Roo as a child and expressed himself without holding back anything he felt. Sang Gu got mad at him when he was pissed off and didn’t treat Geu Roo like he was breakable. I felt that some of the other characters, including the father, at times were coddling Geu Roo to some extent just because of his autism. In that sense, the Uncle-Nephew relationship was refreshing and wholesome to watch, and I only wish that there was a lot more of it.

Lee Je Hoon is, as usual, brilliant in his role as Cho Sang Gu and brings to life a complex character who’s been repeatedly hurt by life but is pure, simple, and golden at heart.
I recently finished watching Taxi Driver, and this man’s acting range is no joke.
I only have praise for him and Tang Jun Sang - who at only 17 did a commendable job. He has left an impression on me, and I will be looking forward to both of their future projects.

Overall this drama was very touching, comforting and though sad, also uplifting and inspiring. It makes you wonder about your own life, what might go into your box, and who you would want your box to be sent to.

9/10 Highly recommended

Interesting concept and lovable characters
Oh my! My eyes are puffed after watching this.

Move to Heaven revolves around a special kid who works with his dad's. Unfortunately, his dad passed away leaving him with his uncle and his friend next door. The series also tells the stories of the deceased which will give heartache and will burst you into tears. Huhu!

Anyway, I loved the concept of this series as it shows the realities of life. I think it is still a taboo for us to talk about the life after death or what will happen to the people that will be left once we died. Maybe we have wishes that we want to achieve, regrets that we want to change, or things that we want to do with our loved ones but cant. This is the reality, we all gonna die. But we dont want to die unprepared, right?

Going back with the story, I love every stories shown in the series. I felt the emotions of the characters. The pain, grief and sorrow. The longing and any kind of emotions a human might felt when someone has gone in their lives.

The characters really are very great. They portrayed their roles well and they are all lovable. I just love everyone of them although some of them arent given justice. SAD. BTW, I knew geu-ru from the CLOY and I just love his acting hehe.

There is no much memorable music in this series though. But it is fine because I can still feel the emotion in the characters. Great job!

Overall, it is a must watch for people looking for some heart-aching, heart-warming not so long drama series. I am sure you will not gonna missed any part and that you will enjoy watching til the end. Some stories are really sad but it is okay, you can bear it. Just prepare tons of tissue with you. :))

Whew
I don't think ill ever be the same after this drama. Real tasteful, well crafted work of art. Probably the best thing to come out of Netflix in the last few years. Was not prepared for the breakdowns every episode. I will have to see my psychiatrist after this. No but really I haven't cried and laughed the next second just to bawl in my mother's lap the very next while watching a kdrama ever. This made me do that! So! Yeah! Don't know about the re-watch value maybe if I wanted to off myself I'd watch again. Anyways, i think every single person should watch this atleast once — if you can stomach it.

DO NOT forget the tissue box *writing this with red eyes*
Already watch a good amount of series and never wrote a review, but could not go without writing one for this one.

First off, I'm being completely honest, did not expect to cry THAT much. :')

The story really catches you and doesn't let go. From the first episode to the last I could not drop this series until I finished it (it is 3 a.m. btw :') thank god it's Saturday). Every episode gives you a new story but at the same time all of them tell you the story of Geu Roo.

For sure the favorite thing was the development of the relationship between the uncle and the nephew.

I don't know if it was the stories that got me or what but I cried my eyes out in EVERY episode. Every story in this series has a meaning and somehow wrecks your heart. Not only does it give you a new perspective towards the people who passed away but it also kind of introduce you to autism and makes you understand people with autism better. Most importantly it remind you to be grateful for people around you, to not waste time, as well as to not hold grudges and remember that the perspective that you see things from it might be completely different from what the truth actually is.

I'm quite mad at myself since I had this series in my list for a long time but for some reason always pushed it away. DO NOT do that. This drama is worth every second. If I could I would love to watch it again without knowing the story.

WOW!!!
I saw this pop up on my suggested to watch on Netflix and I passed it a couple of times because I was kind of iffy on if 1, I would like this, and 2, if my soul was ready for this! But I do not regret the decision to start it at all!!!

You will be sad for almost every episode but the story itself is so beautiful! The business Move to Heaven itself would devastate me because of how much care was put into each situation. The stories that went with each situation were so heartwarming and wholesome! I can't recommend this more honestly! Just wow! The acting was amazing! I'd watch it again and again lol! Without saying too much this is all I can say!

""As long as you remember, they are not gone.""
A raw, beautiful drama depicting the unfairness of life and how quickly death comes for all of us. Although having only 10 episodes, this drama was packed with emotion and plot; each episode had a different story that explored multiple perspectives of death. From the relationship of the two main characters to the inevitable presence of death, this short series is a painful reminder that life is horribly unfair sometimes. The people who deserve to be here a little longer are always the ones who go first.

The concept of trauma cleaners appears as the guiding story in this drama, a term that isn't popularized or well-known in today's culture. This drama paints the hard parts of the job, from dealing with death and misery, and also why the job is necessary, letting the deceased have one last word. What I found especially enduring is the Move the Heaven yellow box. In a time of darkness, despair, and blackness, the yellow box symbolizes a release, a sign of hope and clarity.

Acting: The two main leads, Lee Je-hoon and Tang Joon-Sang, play their parts in a way that truly brings out their characters. Although the acting isn't wildly superb, the emotions spilled off the screen and landed in the viewer's hearts. If you're a fan of the ""mortal enemies to forever brothers"" or ""I hate everyone but you"" trope, this drama is a must-watch as both actors build their relationship through such a small period of time (need a season 2!).

This drama is so short, yet it made such a difference and changed my perspective on grieving. As long as you remember them, they will always stay with you. If you've recently lost someone you loved or are going through a tough time grappling with this unsettling concept, give this drama a watch. It's worth your time.

What an emotional roller-coaster ride.
This is the type of drama that will break your heart and make you question a lot about your surrounding but at the end will still manage to repair your heart all over again. Every character is very different from one another, which makes it fun and interesting to watch. It has a very simple story-line yet very beautifully delivered. You will get the chance to relate with some characters in one way or the other as it tries to show the reality of our society.
If you wanna escape from the trendy drama genre and wanna take a better look in understanding general people like oneself, then this drama will be the best to watch.
Note: Prepare your tissues tho.

A touching story to see
1st I would like to say that I have just finished watching this drama and I've really enjoyed it. The actors have portrayed the characters really well and made me feel some way. Storyline was really amazing. I could see that the uncle slowly had sympathy for his nephew and the relationship building up over time. I loved the neighbour friend who's willing to help out all the time. Near the end was the most sad parts for me. There was only 10 episodes but the story managed to get wrapped up nicely!!

Series for solace
Hearing that this drama made lots of viewers cry and me not really into emotional dramas made me thought that I would never be able to watch it. Luckily, I got bored which made me watch it. It is one of the best dramas I have ever watched! A gem!

The drama itself was very unique. I just enjoyed the story and watched earnestly. From the actors, the subplot and the main plot, the production, overall was splendid! It also had humor making the drama quite balanced: having me feel a roller coaster of emotions.

With their wish to remind people to look around and view the world with care (to care for one another), they also reminded me to be good with my loved ones and to keep them in touch.

If you want to have some insights or if you want to be emotional then I highly suggest this one.

Watch Move To Heaven :)
This is the first time ever I'm writing a review for a show, but I just needed to talk about the greatness that is this drama. Move to Heaven is THE definition of a show done right: the writing was excellent, the story was touching and captivating, the actors were incredible, the directing was magnificent, the editing and choice of music were so beautifully done, and i don't know what happened behind the scenes but I know the crew held it down and did what had to be done as well!
Listening to people talk about it, or watching the trailer, you may get the idea that the show is only meant to make you cry. But let me tell you that no, Move to Heaven does so much more. Yes, you will definitely shed more tears than you expected (so if you're only planning a couple of tissues for a few tears here and there, reconsider and go for the whole box), however, you will also laugh, you will be upset, you will feel empathy, you will feel joy, and you will heal with the characters. All the emotions in the book will be felt throughout these 10, 50-minute long, episodes.
I don't want to give away so much that it would spoil the show, but watch Move to Heaven for the story it tells. Allow yourself to be so immersed into the story that you will heal with the characters. The topics addressed throughout the drama are pretty heavy, but you will see that they do it so well that you will find yourself wanting to see more, because you will want to explore your own feelings more.
I'm going to end this with a MAJOR shoutout to the actors. While everyone else contributed to making the story and finding a great way to relay it both visually and sonically, the actors brought out their A+ game to sell the story. Lee Je-hoon, Ji Jin-her, Hong Seung-hee, specifically Tang Joon-sang (and ALL the actors involved) did an excellent job. They made the story believable, and that is the best thing you can do for a show as an actor.
So once again, please watch Move to Heaven!

Need a good cry? A good cathartic show.
Several other great reviews to explain how phenomenal show is. So I'll cut to the chase.

You will cry, some episodes more than others, some less than others. But at least once, you'll cry. Because this show emphasizes closure, you won'tusually leave an episode empty. Sometimes, you'll hope that certain situations were more fleshed out or a happier outcome, but like all things in life, it's acceptance of instances that are out of our hands. That's what this show gives: understanding that death is a normal part of life and that, though it's sad, people will carry the memory of the deceased and life must move on.

My only reason for the 9.0 rating instead of the 10.0 on the storyline was the ending. I know it was meant for a potential second season; however, this 10-ep series would've been enough. I feel like any overarching conflicts, aside from the ML's personal one with a certain deceased from the beginning, would stray from the theme of this series. However, everything else was fantastic.

Definitely will rewatch. Recommend it highly.

It's just so beautiful
Move to heaven oh boy where to I begin, the story is very unique and the acting is so good, the story is beautifully crafted to make sense and gain some sort of connection to the viewer. There heart wretching scenes, happy scenes, wholesome scenes, and scenes where in you just put yourselves in their shoes. I just really can't put into words how I feel about this K drama which defeats the purpose of writing this review in the first place but I just wanna tell you this drama is a bop. Besides the story the character development is soooo good and it almost feels like as if it's natural, I just love this so much. Even though it's only 10 episodes it's more than enough to tell it's story, you may want more but it isn't the type wherein they just leave you hanging it's just a great series, 10/10 bravo Move to Heaven

Definite Must Watch!!
First off, hats off to the producers, writers, crew & actors of this show!!! I definitely hundred percent enjoyed myself while watching this( finished it in 2 days cause it was this good).

Firstly Geu-Ru's character was portrayed perfectly and so well that you'd think the actor himself is someone familiar with Asperger's syndrome. As someone who has a cousin that's on the autistic scale and has similar traits that Geu-Ru portrayed it felt so heartwarming to see that the time and research had gone into being able to capture the essence of what it's like for people who love with it.

At the beginning when his uncle came to be his guardian, I was pissed at how inconsiderate he was towards Geu-Ru, but as time goes on I loved how he slowly warmed up to him and became even more fond of him. Also the relationship between his older brother and him, even though he'd died, towards ep 7-9 you saw how he got the closure he needed. Loving all his life thinking his brother abandoned him when in reality he got hurt the day he was to come and had been looking for him since. That struck a chord with me.

Next of Na-Mu. She was one heck of a friend. It's not a lot of people who'd willingly make that extra effort and time to befriend people like Geu-Ru. And the fact she liked him and had the patience to still stick by his side and watch out for him, showed how much she cared deeply and would protect him.

MY only dislike is the ending. Netflix is notorious for those cliffhanger endings but I never expected it to happen with a show like this. Yes the ending was nice, but the way it closes off like the storyline can be continued. It never ended in a finalized way. Meaning there are opportunities for it to be continued. However I went online and looked to see if there's a season 2, or talks about a second season hopefully and there weren't any. Over all it's a great show

Brilliant
I came for Lee Je Hoon and stayed for Tang Jun Sang. what a revelation. they were both so incredible at portraying these deeply complex emotional characters. Their unconventional relationship turned out to be so beautiful and wholesome. the way their own backstories unfolded was just amazing. my heart was aching for both of them in different ways. it was funny, cute, and soulful. Watching them take care of the deceased’s belongings and finding out the stories thru the stuff they left behind was beyond touching. there wasn’t an episode where i didn’t cry. every character was so well written and acted and the cinematography is breathtaking. 10/10 recommend. I will probably rewatch it again soon

Simply Lovely
As someone who hadn't watched the trailer before the release and wasn't too sure of the concept when reading the synopsis, Move to Heaven is one of the greatest surprises I have ever had. The story was simply a masterpiece, thought-provoking and makes you really think about life - which I love to think about. I also love the different characters, and how they are with one another. The acting was great, apart from a couple of scenes, but nothing major here. The OST wasn't too noticeable but instead I felt was used very appropriately to hype up suspense or mystery (another great choice here). The re-watch value is high due to the fact that there are only 10 episodes, which some only lasting about 45 minutes (but only feel like 20 minutes or so!).

I highly suggest that you watch Move to Heaven. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I did.

Each episode moves you closer to heaven
The series let's us explore life through the eyes of dying/dead people, who are unable to tell lies. We get to see the facts, and if you wish to do so, you get uplifted. The leitmotiv is thus very different from a rom-com (there are hints throughout, but little development, leaving it to the viewer to hope for more, again uplifting you), or a standard drama.
Though there is no direct reference to it, this series is akin to Dante's Purgatory, the second part of his masterpiece, the Divine Comedy. A soul having seen the worst in hell, is now climbing to heaven amidst other climbers, until he is ""puro e disposto a salire alle stelle"", in such a state that he can reach to enter heaven.

Breath Catching Stories
This drama is insanely beautiful. I think everyone can relate to the stories you hear about in this drama.

The acting is realistic, the story made me cry from sadness to happiness. This is just a drama about life and even if you have some unrealistic death stories on it, everyone can relate to this moment you lost someone you love and you are looking for answers or memories in their clothes or in their other stuff.


In my point of view, if I cry for a drama tv show, then that's means, it's a good one.

A lovely and surprisingly heartwarming story
Two outstanding dramas in one season are more than I would have expected, but following on the heels of Navillera, we have Move to Heaven, an Unexpectedly charming and moving story of an autistic boy and his uncle. After watching Lee Je-hoon in Taxi Driver, I was pretty past my limit for violence and revenge, and if I had realized that he's playing the uncle, I would not have watch this. I""m so glad I was ignorant - he proved to be an actor of excellent range and made the transition from ex-convict to caring man elegantly and subtly. All of the cast was terrific. The writing was well paced, as was the direction. You'll shed a tear or two, and the stories nested within the main story elaborate the plot and the feelings. This is well worth watching.

Good Enough
Korean Drama ""Move To Heaven"" is an emotional drama with lots of shades of sadness, happiness and a big dose of closure.

The story starts with a tragedy right off, an event that triggers the rest of the action which mostly hides behind short per episode cases of death and how the main characters help those who had lost someone to move on. Those short stories were different from one another and covered a lot of topics, from parent love to lost lovers. They were beautifully portrayed and fitted in the main story axis well.

As for the main characters' mystery, that unfolded slowly but steadily, being boosted by the smooth pace and the intense background stories. The performances were spot on, simple but emotional, and, overall, enjoyable. The few characters were a good choice also.

So, 9.5 out of 10.

Tear jerker
What can i say? I enjoyed this watch so much.
It's the type of tv show that touches your heart.
There wasn't an episode that i didn't feel for the deceased, man. I cried a ton because albeit the lack of display of emotions from Geu Ru, his honesty and the his goal to give that yellow box to the family/lover of the deceased got to me. He really didn't stop at anything. He wanted to make sure that he delivers tje message of the deceased to the person that needs to hear it.

I don't really know anything about asperger's so i wouldn't know if he did good in portraying that but on it's own Jun Sang really did an amazing job. His actions (mainly the way that he moved about and his eye contact) the way that he delivered his lines didn't seem awkward at all to the point that i felt for the character each time.


I'm so happy they tailored a character that would fully understand Geu Ru (no judgement and all). Can i just say that I loved Na Mu's character? She understood Geu Ru w/o him having the need to explain anything and to me that is something so beautiful.

As always, an amazing job from both Ji Jin Hee and Lee Je Hoon. These two are always so good and authentic w/ whatever role they portray. The twist to me was something that i did not expect!!!!! I just wish they didn't wait till the last two episodes to reveal that but anyway, they still did a beautiful job w/ it.

Incredible short drama which will make you laugh and cry
This has been a refreshing drama. It has a little bit of humor, meaningful and touching stories, outstanding character portrayal. I literally couldn't ask for more.

As usual I love dramas with mini stories every episode while also creating a big picture for the drama overall. I love how the character developments are implemented and how the characters' stories are revealed one by one. There's a charm on the story wherein it's very simple yet it is also very deep.

The main leads' chemistry is very good. I love how their characters help each other to be a better person. The actors indeed make their characters come to life. GeuRu is now added on my most memorable fictional character list.

The whole drama is also 10 episodes only which why I'm able to fit it on my busy schedule. I recommend this if you want to watch and unwind on a weekend. This drama will surely make you laugh and cry and relieve your stress away.

Heartwarming story about family and their hardships
Hmm.. where do i start...

This show has 10 episodes and each episode has different story about each person that has moved to heaven (passed away). It also has a bigger main story that will unfold slowly. The epic one is in the last episode. It’s so heartwarming, i want to cry. This story taught me a lot to learn that we must stay grateful no matter how hard our life is because everyone has different history, we as people should try to communicate better, be more understanding, don’t assume anything until we clarify the fact tru communication. Don’t stay bitter and childish because everyone has their own reason to do something.

It’s not everyday that we get this kind of story. Not sure why the rating is not that high. This show is practically one of the top kdramas in my opinion.

Netflix original series kdramas never disappoints me.

I’m not good at writing reviews but I just want to say I loved this drama. It was a very simple in terms of storyline. There was nothing too dramatic that happened.
I can’t speak on the portrayal of Asperger’s but I’m glad to see people with Asperger’s say that there was an accurate representation.
While I do agree with the reviews saying Geuru’s character wasn’t developed enough, I’m still giving this drama a high rating. I do wish we had gotten to know more about Geuru and even Namu. The “cop friend” was introduced just for us to barely see him. I don’t know if there’ll be a season 2 but if there is, I’m intrigued to see how Sanggu and the social worker’s story will progress.
Personally, I found the drama very sad and it made me cry almost every episode. Maybe I’m just soft lmao but I do think it was a tearjerker. I would say the rewatch potential is high because if you ever want to cry you might put it on. I don’t think it’s something you’d watch just to watch though.
The soundtrack wasn’t anything extremely special. But since I enjoy classical music from time to time I quite liked it.
Overall I enjoyed this. The actors did great. I hope Joonsang wins best new actor or something cuz he’s doing amazing!! I didn’t even realize Jehoon was in Time To Hunt. Either way the cast was great. It was nice to see some familiar faces. Hope y’all enjoy this the way I did :)) and if you’re an emotional person, don’t forget your tissues.

AN AMAZING AND A BEAUTIFUL DRAMA!! There were so many things that I love about this drama ughh. First of all, the trauma cleansing itself, never heard of it before, so I kinda learn something new and it gives me a different perspective about life, about how the deceased could speak. Of course, the stories about each of the deceased as well as the main character themselves, they were interesting, amazing, heartfelt and gives me roller coaster of emotions. I lost count on how many times I cried, but what I know for sure is ep8 and ep10 were a crying fest :'((( And love love loveee their relationship so much Cho Sang Gu, Han Geu Ru and Namu, every single episode I want to know more about them and looking forward for their scenes together. Their characters ugh love themm and of course top tier acting. I just don't know how to describes even more, amazinggg please watch it. and I need season 2!!!

both heart-warming and heart-wrenching
the character development of sang gu might possibly be one of my favourite things to witness in a kdrama. i went from hate, to pity, to love. i don't think i've been so attached to a character before. i couldn't find myself hating any of the recurring cast, for any of their actions that irritated me briefly were completely justifiable (with the exception of na mu's mother- i understand her concern for her daughter but she was incredibly judgemental and close-minded). na mu's protectiveness of geu ru might be an example. it can appear that she was too judgemental of sang gu, but it makes sense seeing as geu ru is incredibly vulnerable and sang gu's initial plan was to indeed exploit his position as a guardian for financial security, and his occupation did indirectly put geu ru in harm's way.

as for possibly the most important aspect, that being the portrayal of autism, i don't personally have the experience, but my brother sits on the spectrum. i'd say that, as far as i could tell, the traits of geu ru weren't too overstated...it addressed the issue of their pure intentions being perceived as malicious (eg. ep 1 where he follows the nurse to ask where she got the badge) and how many undermine or maybe even overestimate their intelligence, as well as difficulties accepting change, grief etc. as an autistic person. i really hope that more kdramas will give proper representation to autistic people that doesn't necessarily dominate the plot, but is just a feature of the protagonist.

the exploration of things that couldn't be said in words but could be shown in belongings is so intriguing and heartbreaking...i mean, i didn't expect to burst into tears when seeing shoe boxes or punching gloves, but here we are; however, not only are unwritten messages of love to the bereft sent by move to heaven, but so is justice (e.g. episodes 3-4). i did find the abusive boyfriend's acting to be a little bit too stereotypically villainous, like cackling when he was caught etc. though i understand that it was meant to demonstrate his ability to play the victim and switch.

if i absolutely had to make a criticism, i suppose that it would be the very end of the last episode, in which geu ru appears to be enchanted by a girl. there might not be any romantic connection, but the ambiguity of the scene mildly irked me. is she terminally ill? or is she planning to bring an end to her own life? what did the white butterfly symbolise? life? purity? surely, the connotations contrast what she is saying, unless her transition to heaven is symbolised in the butterfly. maybe this is a set-up for season 2 (?) if i was being optimistic.

Needs a season 2!
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DRAMA OF 2021!! I loved it with all my heart and now I need a second season or else I'll die for sure. The acting on point, chef's kiss. Lee Je Hoon hottie as always. And the storyline was amazing heartbreaking at moments.

From like episode 6 until the end I just kept crying. It was non-stop. I felt bad for the uncle the whole time like poor thing suffered, but omg that I was glad that he became the official guardian it made my heart burst with happiness, hopefully, that girl from the fights will just go to jail cuz I already sense the bad coming. Na-mu was so cute of a friend also she a real one, even though she was a little dramatic in certain things but it was all in good intentions. And my boy Geu Ru was just the sweetest bean.

That series defines the meaning of a blessing in desguise
Geu- ru, portrayed by a magnificent Tang Joon -Sang, loses his (probably) everything, his father. He has asperger's syndrome, so he relied in his father for all Life up to that point. So here there Is his uncle that take on stage ! He Is not the best option, but here we are, when It seems to be like a mess, he becomes for Geu-ru his new family.
Emotions are really difficult to understand, sometimes also for people without autism and the fact that the protagonist as to deal with It, makes the things more difficult. I can't describe how beautifully made Is this series, it heals my soul. This teaches me to not miss the boat and never give up! If you have an hard time, you have to rest yourself and if you have, like the protagonist, to let someone new in your Life, give them a chance. Maybe they will became your "" a blessing in desguise"" !

""Even for the deceased, we can still hear their voice."" - Move To Heaven
I normally don't write any reviews at all because I'm bad at it but I recommend this drama to everyone. This Drama is definetely a masterpiece. I haven't watched such an incredible drama in a long time.

First of all... this drama is a brutally emotional rollercoaster (seriously, I cried alot). At first I was very spectical and I watched it without any kind of expectation. I did not even read the plot at all.

We can see in 10 Episodes, storys of deacesed people. Even though we don't think about it but >>even deceased people, are able to speak. They also say a story. Their story.<<
I loved that every Episode, had a whole new Story. A new sad story they coulnd't tell bevor they passed away. The most emotional part is, that the main lead Geu-Ru was so desperate, to deliever the message to the Relatives, that he would do everything for it.

But society was also analyzed and presented well. It is sad to see how society thinks, reacts and acts. It broke my heart. Normally every person should watch this drama, just to see how society deals with such things, with such sad stories.

What surprised me the most is the length of the drama. It wasn't short and it wasn't long at all. There were NO useless placeholders or anything. I started the drama and when it was over, it felt like I started it a few mins ago.

Last but not least.... I need to say... the acting was INCREDIBLE. I loved every actor, it was mind blowing.

""Although you can't see someone, it doesn't mean they're not with you. As long as you remember, they are not gone"" - Move to Heaven

All I have to say is ""Thank you for this incredible Drama"".

What a ride!
Honestly, I really didn't think I would love this drama at first. I just started watching as if I wouldn't finish it crying. This is the first time I am writing a review on here but not gonna lie, it is worth it.

First of all, the concept of the show is wonderful. You can get all types of emotions while watching this. The stories of each defunct are all well-written and beautiful. I really was scared to watch this, I thought this would get me bored but it definitely didn't, I got stuck in my room watching 7 episodes in a row yesterday, I am not even kidding! This show got me addicted to the characters and their stories.

The acting. THE ACTING !!! I just realized how good of an actor Tang Jun Sang is, his acting was so touching I thought it was real. The character of Han Geu-ru was literally made for this actor, I cannot see someone else portray him. Jun Sang needs to get an award for this drama, I swear, every scene of his were well-done.

Overall, this is a sad drama but it helps you to learn a life-lesson. It helps you realize how important your social life can be and that, even if you die, someone will always remember you somewhere. This drama even has that slight of comedy, and I sincerely love that, from Na-Mu and Sang-Gu's fights to Na-Mu's parents, I laughed a lot. That's why I call this drama an emotion ride, you cry but you still laugh. Well, watch it, you will not regret it ! <3

One of the best of 2021
I love healing and life dramas. Move to heaven is handsdown one of the best dramas of this category. At first I was very curious that how they will turn a essay into a 10 episode long drama. I have to say the writer has done an amazing job in doing it. Move to heaven is healing,moving and makes you cry buckets. The writer not only showed as the story behind each deaths. How each death leaves you scared and how they heals you. Each death around us tells a story but we are so busy in our own we usually ignore them . Through this beautiful story the writer encourages us to think how we lived our life so far ,how we should live it after this. The 10 epiodes tells us story of death of different people in a heart warming way. The acting is really good themain cast and supporting cast both did a fabulous job. If you like stories which make you cry and then will leave you with a smile then you should take up this drama. This drama is all about life ,death and love. It's heartwarming and fulfilling .it will help you became a better human. Do watch this if you are a fan of life dramas and you have patience to watch this kind of dramas otherwise don't bother.

It's interesting the level of high scores this received and I wonder if it partially has to do with the exposure of being an original Netflix series. I'm still up in the air on firms like Netflix increasingly capitalizing on anime and the international sphere but eh.

You know the shows/movies where your eyes are glued to the set and you demand no interruptions? This one started off as such but then trails off a bit during the middle. The uniqueness of the plot is what really makes this one great but outside of it, it does still consist of the similar predictability you come across in many k-dramas. But also as with many k-dramas tropes, even while knowing the direction they're taking you in, you'll still give into the emotional roller-coaster.

In no way an expert in autism but the similar shortfalls found in the Good Doctor, was also evident here. While I love when anyone who is viewed as different in the world being celebrated for their differences and strengths, there feels to be a heavy hand in highlighting positives when convenient which causes inconsistencies through various scenarios. And maybe because it was only 10 episodes but the flow from switching focuses of your main characters didn't flow too naturally.

If you happen to be in emotional mood, prepare yourself with a tissue box. While it's not really as profound as it had the potential to have, it will still offer many viewers a good visualization of seeing things from a different perspective. It's worth the watch but hopefully they will follow up with a good continuation, particularly because of the ending where they tried to create some type of mystery but instead of creating anticipation, it felt out of place.

A Masterpiece
Every once in awhile something comes along that touches your heart and tugs at every
emotion. This is it for me. I thought of my dear
mother dying on the operating table and our
last words, I thought of my best friend dying
of terminal cancer at 35 and of being summoned
to the hospital as they made attempt after
attempt to bring my dearest cousin back to life. Finally, I just said stop...no more. The acting is
superb, the music hauntingly beautiful. Thanks to all the writers and anyone involved in this
project. I can only hope for a second season.

“Moving & Heavenly”
I appreciate TV series that have an educational aspect because watching becomes dual purpose - I gain knowledge while being entertained. This drama centers around Asperger’s Syndrome and trauma cleaners. Two unconnected and unlikely topics but intertwined so fluidly into the storyline. I admire the screenwriter’s diligence in conducting in-depth research and then incorporating gathered facts into the script.

The storyline is heavy on the heart because there is always a death scene and immense grief but the lessons and realizations about life and love are what always prevail in the end.

The lead character was realistically portrayed by Tang Joon Sang who I first encountered as a naive soldier in “Crash Landing On You”. His acting skills concretely delivered what the creators behind this drama series wished to convey. And, not to forget his impressive memorization skills - his lines were laden with tongue-twisting terminologies that only a genius can utter at lightning speed!

The only downside? It is merely 10 episodes so it’s going to leave you wanting for more...

This drama will take you through a beautiful emotional journey. I got to appreciate the importance of listening and respecting choices of a person who has passed away. Beautifully woven tale of gradual development of caring and affection as well as resolution of misunderstandings.

The ML, Lee Jee Hoon has been part of recent successful dramas that show case his wide range of acting abilities. Tang Jun Sung is another promising actor to look out for as his excellent portrayal of a young man with Aspergers. The spunky neighbor girl was awesome as well. All side characters were likable and did justice to their roles.

A good watch but little bit hard emotionally if you have recently lost a loved one.

Something different
I thoroughly enjoyed move to heaven. It had an eerie yet homely feel to it, if that makes sense. The main characters all have temperaments that would typically clash yet they became very close and eventually, unable to be without each other. The acting was amazing and the storylines each episode simply got more and more riveting. The one thing I liked the most about the drama was how every scene was meaningful as I can say that I never ever felt the urge to skip. I also liked how a love interest was brought about for the older brother yet it wasn't pushed in our faces, it all felt just right.

I loved every single moment in this drama (although i have skipped some part of some ppl's back story ex. the ppl who passed due to my bad attention span) nonetheless it's definitely something i'd recommend to everyone !

the relationship between everyone in this drama is so so precious & it shows the depth of how much someone could love you & how its not easy to let go. now that i think of it i have so much to say but the words are just Not forming.

the main characters are filled with regrets , grief & love and i love the closure they gave them.

every cast played their characters SOOOO good im very much impressed and would love to see more of them.

The first Korean series of this year that managed to make me burst into tears, at least in one episode.

A different story from Korean, coupled with the acting of all actors were also extraordinary is the main advantages of this series.

Another thing that I like of this series is they’re not “wordy” to extend the duration like we often found in other dramas (especially from South Korea).

And last... The classical music along the way added to the emotional side of this series so that I didn't realize made my tears fall down.

In Indonesian:
Serial korea pertama tahun ini yang berhasil membuatku menangis tersedu-sedu, setidaknya dalam satu episode.

Cerita yang berbeda dari drama korea lainnya, ditambah dengan akting para pemain yang juga luar biasa menjadi kelebihan utama dalam series ini.

Hal lain yang saya suka adalah, series ini tidak bertele-tele hanya untuk memperpanjang durasi layaknya yang sering kita temukan pada drama lainnya (especially from south korea).

Alunan musik klasik sepanjang perjalanan menambah sisi emosional series ini hingga tak sadar membuat airmata saya turun dengan sendirinya.

A real class act from fine young actors!
Prepare your kleenex for this one. A beautiful story about beautiful souls. Move To Heaven is a 10-episodes drama, not your typical drama. If you don’t have time to spare, this is a good option.

Death is unavoidable. We are familiar with various grieving stories. We see plenty of forensic drama. We have more than enough drama involving death but there are not many dramas that could tell a story about death like Move to Heaven. I don’t even know that this service exists!

Remember this phrase “hurt people hurt people”. Thus, only loved people are able to love others even if their love language is not a common one like our protagonist in this movie. Han Geu Ru is loved by his father despite his condition and therefore he has been living in a secured bubble full of love. This movie is about how that love allows him to overcome the challenges in daily life and in particular his struggle to accept his uncle. This is about what family means to you.

The one that left the biggest impression is the acting of the casts. I watched this in parallel with Taxi Driver. Basically, I saw Lee Je Hoon playing two characters at the same time and I am in awe of his acting. He is handsome (don’t even start) but that’s not why I was charmed throughout this series. It’s the way he expressed Cho Sang Gu, a person that kept a bitter memory for so long that he doesn’t believe in happiness. I enjoy his acting throughout the episodes.

The production paired LJH with Tang Jun Sang who played Han Geu Ru in immaculate way. The interaction between these two are beautiful. I saw Tan Jung Sang in Crash Landing on You and Racket Boys. For sure, TJS will go places. He still has a long way to go in his career and is already able to convey subtle emotions. I heard he couldn’t watch Move to Heaven because of the rating.

If you are big fans of classical music, you will be pleased with Move to Heaven just like me.

I suggest you watch it if you want to have a good cry and appreciate good acting. Well, LJH is a nice bonus :-)

Watch: June 2021

Heartwarming and heartbreaking
Ahhh this show warms the heart then breaks it then warms it again! I have such shallow tears for sad/crying fathers and this show brings it on like there's no tomorrow! The plot and characterization are both challenging that the task of being able to show this and bring out the right emotions would have been daunting for a less competent actor. Guess what, all leads in this series are such great actors that they can change the mood of the scene as fast as required. My recent favorite LJH is at it again with his expressive eyes and distinctive voice. The father is just as convincing as the son in portraying honesty and integrity in their work. This is a must-watch for families who have somehow drifted apart.

about disability as a masterpiece
My first impression of this drama was quite skeptical. It wasn't thought of as it would appear that it might have acted intentionally, but fortunately the worries weren't right. The drama presents in a very nice way how people with difficulties, such as Asperger, can live and act normally as people. It was beautiful.

According to the story, which was interestingly interesting, the concept of how it works in Korea was not retained ... I mean - cleaning and funerals on the other hand. Getting to know something they don't really know. It shows the attitude of Korean culture. For the first time, I saw a masterpiece in which imaginary love is not in the foreground. I want more...!

But the plot also has some disadvantages ... an episode about the relationship between the lady and her uncle quite incomprehensible, as if a few episodes were missing. I don't understand why - will it be season 2? I hope there is something that goes with the house and the lady ... Yet the main reader that is still a trace from the family, although from the episode on the channel after death this channel is that he has to be with himself and be for society .

Can I play - I can't say anything - because it was just nice. The same thing about music - it was a pleasure, but I don't remember the song.

All in all, it is one of the best dramas of 2021, based on a story worth winding and missing in sweet dramas.

RARE SYNOPSIS
I thought at first I am going to be bored with this drama, an Asperger young man that has above normal intelligence, works for his dad a Trauma Cleaner 'Move to Heaven' company that pack items left by the deceased - with bow for respect the dead they box in meaningful personal belongings and get rid of the rest - a service that goes beyond what's expected. They'd be able to tell the story of the diseased to pass it on to their family. Geo Ru's father passes on, his uncle Sang Koo becomes the guardian of him with condition that he has to work at the company and live with him. Although Sang Koo has issues, went to jail for illegal underground fight, his demeanor is 'care less - hell with everything' does not bound well with Geo Ru's habitual and repetitive behavior.

This is the type of rare story line that we don't see, very interestingly there is called a Trauma Cleaner - a service to provide clean up what dead people left behind. Different cases has different uniquely background stories when the diseases were still alive. The synopsis is their personal stories, the family (or none) that they left behind; unspoken wishes and hopes, sadness, love or hate, regret and abandonment. A dirty work that emotionally burdened, personally I won't do their job. It's a very touching not from the main actors but mostly from the supporting actors who portrays the dead people. Not matter how good this drama I don't think i can rewatch it....the kind of drama that you only want to watch once.

Stellar acting performances and focused storytelling
Quite simply, Tang Jun Sang is an amazingly versatile and talented young star and Lee Je Hoon puts down the best performance of 2021 so far. This show has quite a few qualities, but these two actors are what lifts this production to one of the most noteworthy.

It helps that it seems that it was set from the beginning to be multiple seasons so that not all the storylines had to be backfilled and fully wrapped by the end of the tenth episode. The overall arc of our main duo's story could be pushed forward with an adeptly placed flashback for Gu Ru's parents to keep the story flowing evenly throughout.

The subplots of each episode were, for the most part, woven in to the main story seamlessly and, although it was a show with fewer secondary characters, the casting did not miss. High marks for the production quality too.

I eagerly await season two.

Its a recommend drama from a drama addict
Even thought this drama is a drama that is about an autism boy and a family drama but it made me cried a lot especially the last ep and the first ep. I cried a lot because i'm a person that gets sad easily. I watched this drama just in one day. So I really think its a good drama to recommend to those people who wants to cry? There's a lot more but i can't type finish. I hope this review helped you (i mean everyone). you can ask me anything if you have questions to ask. :) ..............................................................................

It was rare to see a drama tackling the story revolving trauma cleaners; like the first time I've heard of the term it was on some detective story I think and it was a minor mention, so it was great to see one drama that touched this topic.

This drama was really soothing and comforting... especially for people who may have a hard time dealing with deaths of people dear to them and how it affected everyone around them. And I like how the drama had been written and how layered the stories were. Like on one hand we get to see how and what was involved in the trauma cleaning work as well as the untold stories of people who may have died alone with no one to take care of the things they left behind. On the other hand, we're also seeing how through the trauma cleaning work, Geurum and Sanggu were also indirectly attempting to accept the death of their loved ones.

I especially love the focus on Sanggu's character. Like at the beginning he wasn't too keen on becoming a guardian to his nephew and helping out with the trauma cleaning job. Yet as time went on we get to see him getting used to the job and clear his misunderstanding against his deceased older brother.

A story about the redemptive power of empathy
Ok, so I just binged the first 10 released episodes and I am consumed by the lingering feeling of dissatisfaction that it went so quick, it was just not enough!! This drama tells the story of a group of ""trauma cleaners"", people who are responsible for the proper disposal of the personal possessions of the deceased. They do so with deep sensitivity and care, providing the last shred of respectability which life may have stolen away from . The drama deals with the victims of the various malaise of society like economic inequality, homophobia, gender violence etc , the misery of the sufferer and the numbness of society towards them. Society guided by petty self interest denies them their basic dignity, and the trauma cleaners step in to restore some of it after their death. In this process, the cleaners work through their own problems and learn to value what is important to them.
It s directed and acted magnificently. The acting is understated and natural and there is hardly any dramatic hyperbole for sensationalism. You can savor each episode slowly as it draws you into its world leaving behind a bittersweet aftertaste and loads of food for thought. A must watch as a serious but deeply entertaining drama.

Moving and touching with lighter moments
Wonderful acting from both Lee Je-hoon and Tang Jun-sang in the main roles; the latter must have researched Asperger Syndrome to give such a credible performance. LJH played his troubled, detached and tough guy role really well, being a selfish, but kind of lovable, if grungy, rogue. A very different look for him!
There are some violent scenes that are a hard watch, but fit the story rather than being for shock effect.
The stories that emerge of those that have passed, whose effects it is also the job of 'Move to Heaven' trauma cleaners to pack up and dispose of, are varied and very moving.
With Geu Ru's amazing memory, observational skills and ability to connect clues, they are able to provide closure for those who cared about the deceased.
In tandem with this, are Geu Ru and Sang Gu's own personal issues, which are revealed at a perfect pace.
Na Mu, well played by Hong Seung-hee, can be an irritating character at times, but her care for Geu Ru is plain to see and she is protective of him, even though she has an overly vivid imagination at times! She can also be quite fearless... or possibly stupid, depending on how one looks at some of her actions.
There's a great supporting cast too and I particularly liked the lawyer, Oh Hyun Chang, perfectly portrayed by Im Won-hee, whose no nonsense approach and sometimes disdainful looks, are a great source of amusement.
I also liked the lighter moments in the relationship between Geu Ru and Sang Gu. The latter does not pity Geu Ru and treats him as a means to an end initially, but can't help gradually seeing how incredible a person he is.
There was a glimmer of romance for him at one point too, which I was rooting for.
Geu Ru is so likeable and whilst he communicates differently, is quite inspirational at times. He steps out of his comfort zone on occasion too and when he fixes on something, is an immovable force.
There are several aspects to this drama that are additional stories crying out to be taken further, especially one character and their hinted affect on Geu Ru, at the end.
That's where the story's conclusion, for me at least, is exceedingly frustrating. It's not a case of an ending where imagination can fill in the 'what happens next', but a real ""what?!... you're leaving us here?!""
If a series 2 was on the cards, I'd be fine with it, but whilst the writer has said they'd like to carry on and has the apparent agreement of the cast to return (I read in an article), nothing has been said or planned by Netflix.... yet.
We live in hope.
Were it not for that, I'd have rated the story a 10.
I also liked the music a lot; some beautiful and fitting classical pieces.
One I'll watch again.

EP 5 A Masterpiece.
Spoilers ahead : ep 5 is better than most the korean bls oit there. Fact. I watch all of them. I need this episode to become a whole drama even tho I know it will only make me cry my heart out. The script, the acting, the details! I figured out everything from the moment they entered his room, the ""pray for orlando"" poster make me sure. Only someone that knew about it will get it and i was suffering from that moment on until the very end! The flashbacks where so hurtful!! And what the protagonist said stayed with me "" It's a shame when you aren't capable of loving, not when in love, isn't it?"" He is so pure, I wish more people would see the world like he does...

SO MUCH LIQUID CAME OUT OF MY FACE HOLES
Thank god there were only 10 episodes...I think I'd probably die from dehydration if there were more than 10 episodes of this drama. Every minute of every episode is a tear jerker. Good grief, I didn't know I even HAD this many tears to cry. Basically everyone is sad and the world is a sad shitty place. I mean clearly they make the show mostly about finding peace amidst the pain, but gosh is there so much pain represented here. Though, even with all the pain, I did like that we weren't forced to watch countless unrealistic happy endings; everything was bittersweet, it doesn't try to fill the sorrow holes it creates with bunches of fake flowers. My advice, if you watch this drama, make sure you drink lots of fluids.

The drama itself had a pretty basic storyline, it was well crafted but not complex. There were a crap ton of social messages, but they weren't invasive and were well integrated. Nothing about this drama was invasive at all. It didn't really ask you to think or figure things out, it basically only asked you to cry along with everyone else watching it as events unfold. The acting was decent, the main character did a pretty great performance as an autistic kid, especially with not making eye contact. There is generally a lot of criticism when actors try to play autism spectrum roles, ""he didn't do this right or that right""...but the reality is that there are so so many different points on the autism spectrum and not every autistic person responds the same. This actor hit enough of the right points to make the character believable without being overacted, gimmicky, or grotesque.

Really, the main character being autistic was convenient for the story because it separated out emotional response from logical response and allowed the viewer to consider both aspects. It also gave the viewers a refuge from the constant pouring rainfall of sadness and allowed them to experience aspects of the story they might not have been able to experience without that sort of grounding logic-based reasoning. They played off this really well throughout the drama, allowing the side-characters to react emotionally and leap to conclusions while the lead character always brought everything back down to earth with a more macro view of the situation.

Overall, it was a really well executed simple drama. I see a lot of reviews wanting a season 2, since it's a Netflix drama and the ending is left sort of open for a sequel. If they end up dropping a season 2 I will watch it....but I will definitely pick the right day to watch it when my poor sensitive heart won't bust in two. SO MUCH LIQUID CAME OUT OF MY FACE HOLES....

Original but left me with questions
First of all, I find the concept very interesting, as I didn't know what trauma cleaners were at all before this. I like how even if this drama mostly features one character per episode and their story (the deceased I mean), it was still deep and engaging and managed to make me care about each character within a limited amount of time. This doesn't happen often for me at all so I applaud the writer for that, and also the director and actors for the execution.

The main cast was great and I think they all did a good job, but let me start with Ji Jin Hee as Jeong U.
Jeong U is so compassionate, patient and optimistic, and it was heartwarming to see how he managed to be such a strong and loving father to Geu Ru despite dealing with the fact that his wife died and that Geu Ru has Asperger's Syndrome. He encouraged Geu Ru a lot and embraced him for who he is without ever judging. He taught Geu Ru many things and how to be empathetic as well (or as close as it gets to being that) and I really appreciated that. Even after Jeong U dies, Geu Ru remembers the things his father said and taught him and he gets reminded of his encouragement when he is uncertain. It was touching to see how he ‘stayed’ with Geu Ru like that. I also like how the last episode really dives into Jeong U and how he adopted Geu Ru and it just added even more to his character for me.

Tang Jun Sang did a wonderful job portraying Geu Ru. I found Geu Ru interesting as a character. It may seem ‘robotic’, but I found it endearing whenever he tried to show his care in his own way to the other characters. Also, sometimes when decoding the deceased’s stories he’d act a bit like Sherlock Holmes, deducing and solving mysteries. He also has a photographic memory, and it’s funny how Sang Gu joked that he’s like an AI and a recorder at the same time (as Geu Ru can also recall conversations exactly how they went in the exact tone people talked).

As for Na Mu, I don’t have much to say because she’s more of a side character ish. But I do really find it commendable that she’s such a supportive and caring friend to Geu Ru and she even ends up working with Move to Heaven as well after Jeong U passes. Although I don’t like the way she’d act towards Sang Gu at times, I also think it’s understandable considering the way Sang Gu ‘introduced’ himself and all the shady things he seemed to be doing at the time.

Sang Gu, as one of the main characters, definitely had character development throughout the drama. He starts off indifferent and kinda rude and salty about the fact he has to take care of the kid of his brother who ‘abandoned’ him (to his assumption) and is ‘forced’ to work with Move to Heaven. But as time goes on, he starts to become more compassionate and he starts to genuinely care for Geu Ru.
However, I find it incredibly disappointing that some key things about him aren’t elaborated. For example, what happened to him when Jeong U couldn’t pick him up at the train station? How did he grow up and live all those years? How did he end up in the boxing field? When the drama elaborated the backstory of him and Su Cheol I was hoping to see how he ended up in the boxing field at least, but it was still not explained.
I also don’t think it’s convincing that Sang Gu didn’t want to see or talk to Jeong U only because he couldn’t pick him up that one time. Like yes it must have been hard as a kid to be left alone like that, but if he talked to Jeong U the misunderstandings could easily be resolved. I just find the writing here to be a bit lacking because I feel like there should have been other things that made Sang Gu feel so distanced and resentful, and not the mere fact that his brother didn't come to the train station as promised. Again, what did he actually have to go through alone all those years?
This is a big question mark for me and flaw since Sang Gu is one of the main characters, and that’s why I can’t empathize with Sang Gu on a deeper level even if I want to.
Another question I have is what led to Jeong U starting a trauma cleaning service? Is it because of his wife? Is it because of some other things he experienced or saw? Also unanswered.

Overall, I did enjoy this drama, but I hope that if there is going to be a S2 that these questions will be answered.

A Heart-warming Drama
⚠Caution
- Contains a suicidal story.
- Contains disgusting scenes (blood, insects, liquids, slum places).

?Drama type
- This drama type is similar to Korean drama Taxi Driver and Japanese anime Detective Conan
- It has a main plot (the story about the main character and his family) while having the side plots running in each episode.
- Side plots: Each episode has its own conflict and will be resolved at the end of the episode. So, an episode has a different conflict story from other episodes. Example (does not contain spoilers): Episode 1 is about the death of someone ending his/her own life. Episode 2 is about the death of someone killed by someone, etc. If you don't like this kind of drama, then it's better to not watch it.

✅Pros
- The story is really heart-warming.
- Family-friendly.
- Unique main plot.
- Top-tier acting by the main character.
- Mysterious irritating yet funny and loveable personality by his uncle that you will be suspecting him in the entire drama.
- Adorable neighborhood character.
- This drama is for you who likes to hurt your eyes so the tears come out :"")
- The duration is not too long so you can binge-watch it on a holiday night.

?Cons
- As always, because this is an original Netflix series (which only has no more than 10 episodes), there is a plot hole (plot missing) at the end.
- The side plot is somewhat boring and sometimes the conflicts are resolved too early/rushed.
- In the beginning, you might find it's annoying to hear the main character's voice because it's how the main character is.

THE INFINITE LIGHTNESS OF BEING.
It was very hard to concentrate on the story because of Lee Je Hoon...I mean this guy is a phenomenon. Is acting EACH TIME is flawless and delivered perfectly.
The story as well is a solid 10. Mental Illnesses, if adequately treated, sometimes offer many abilities that others do not have.
The brain allow you to ""absorbed"" emotions, like the main character superbly portrait.
So the drama starts like a flower bud that in the end blooms.
I adore the cold cynicism of Je Hoon that clashes with the demure yet empowering personality of Hang Ge Ru.
Great show, but a bit more of ""light hearted laugh"" at times lower the value of re-watching.
When the subject is heavy, inserting suspense or laugh is a must.

Extremely overrated
This is probably the most overrated Korean series out there. It's completely different from what I imagined and it's not different in a positive way.

I thought Geu-ru would help his thug uncle become a decent human being. However, in the 5 episodes I've watched, the two barely speak, don't know anything about each other and look more like college roommates than relatives.

The stories of the dead did not move me at all. The guy who died at the factory and the old lady were the slightly interesting stories. The teacher's story is absurd and sick: how does someone who is being stalked by her psychopathic ex-boyfriend OPEN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE FOR HIM TO ENTER???? The gay musician and gay doctor story is a cliché and like the others it didn't even come close to making me shed a tear.

All this added to the slow and depressing pace and the ""brilliance"" of Geu-ru (who seems to be the only one capable of having an intelligent idea. Seriously, he was THE ONLY one who came to the conclusion that the doctor was gay and that they should look for by a male musician? Any reasonably intelligent person came to this conclusion in 3 seconds, and yet the uncle and Na-mu didn't. Sometimes the series pushes Geu-ru's above-normal intelligence too much. It wasn't necessary to do the others complete idiots to make the disabled protagonist intelligent) make this series very unpleasant to watch.

In fact, in this series it seems that they took Cheol-min from Always, Sang-tae from It's Okay To Be Okay and a nosy, nosy young lady like Ha-yeong from Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol or Yu-na from Hotel Del Luna , and played all three in the same series.

Ultimately, I didn't really feel connected to the protagonist's story. I loved Sang-tae from It's Okay To Not Be Okay and really got to feel all the ins and outs of having autism. In Geu-ru's case, I couldn't feel the gift and hardships of illness in the same way.

On the plus side, I really liked the Na-mu character and the OST. Therefore, a note 3.

Good but yeah, a bit dissapointed.
I tried to watch it because Lee Je Hoon and the ratings, but I think it's not that ""masterpiece""?
I expect to cry at every episode but nope, the feel just stops at ""awww so sad"".

The first episode is 10/10 tho. The scenes when Jung-Woo helps the deceased's family and Geu-Ru's reactions when his father did not come back are really tear-jerking.

But idk what happen after that... The story becomes so-so...?
The story is good, but some plots felt forced. But the story when they focus on the main characters is heartwarming. I was hoping the story will focus more on the job, but nah, so many unnecessary additions. Sometimes they forced the romances too (not the one with Na-Mu, trust me Na-Mu is a really cute and caring childhood friend, her mom is annoying tho.)

For the acting and the characters, I really like Geu-Ru's Father. Damn, he should be still alive and be the main character. His character is sooo good. Ji Jin Hee's acting is perfect. Lee Je Hoon did a good job too. I usually love his character at first sight but this one is nope LOL, like what they intend, a trash uncle. The uncle really annoying at first but we can see that he slowly caring for his nephew. Some people hate Na-Mu but I think it's understandable why she care so much to Geu-Ru. And Tang Jun Sang as Geu-Ru? He portrayed an Asperger character really well, sometimes I thought it was not acting because it felt so real.

The music/ost is so-so. Not memorable, and it was just classic music pianos.

TLDR: it's a good tv series but I can't say it's a perfect 10/10. It's felt so messy that I hope they didn't add too many problems with the characters.

Sweet But Not Heavenly For Me…
First I’m going to be really honest and just say this wasn’t for me. Don’t get me wrong. The storyline and process of healing was something I could relate to a lot after losing a relative myself and it did strike a chord with me how the actors were perfectly able to captivate us into the storyline.

So why did I drop it? Well it didn’t really hook me. Normally I love healing tales and storylines but the characters didn’t really make me warm up to them. Of course that’s my personal opinion. It was a good show even from the episodes I saw, but I doubt that I’m going to carry this one forward.

If you’re looking for any kind of romance, this is not the drama for you. If you’re looking for suspense, edge of your seat exciting drama, this is also not for you. But, if your looking for a sweet heartfelt drama with family love, friendship, warmth, sadness, happiness, with a sprinkle of revenge and a plot twist, this drama is for you. The casting and writing were perfect, especially the ML (he is gorgeous by the way), and the senior ML that plays the student of ballet. But the best thing by far, is the ending. This is because all of the plot line is summed up, leaving nothing for you to wonder, what happened to this or that character. If there is one thing that irks me after completing several episodes of a drama to the end, is when it just leaves you kind of hanging. Leaving you to wonder how this couple or character ended up. This drama doesn’t leave you with that feeling, because it clearly explains the future of each character. This is a sweet 12 episode drama that I highly recommend, but have some tissues...

ONE OF THE WARMEST KDRAMA EVER
NAVILLERA will remain one of the warmest Korean Drama ever for all the nostalgic & happy vibes it gave through out the entire thing.

Struggling with your age, when you're on the edge of your life and winning over all the obstacles with hard work and determination to soar within your dream and turning it into a gift, is the greatest message that the drama offers to us.

Such a wholesome and overwhelming drama to witness when you're seeking some comfort in your life. Character development of all the characters have been shown in very short yet in very handsome way. Hats off to Song Kang & Park In Hwan for delivering such a beautiful & graceful chemistry through out the show.

Portraying ballet, a form of art, and explaining life through it, is the major theme of this drama. You will smile widely, laugh, and cry from time to time. It indeed tugs your heartstring with its essence.

Apart from the final performance titled Navillera, the scene that touched my heart was when they hug each other for 1st time before the sepration The last scene was the most beautiful for me when Song Kang and Park In Hwan meet across the label crossing and greet each other through theor ballerina style.

Words might fall short but you will never be able to stop describing how beautiful a drama can be.

A Heartwarming Friendship Fluttering Across Backgrounds And Age...

Based upon the eponymous webtoon by Ji Min, Navillera was adapted onto the small screen by screenwriter Lee Eun Mi ( Tunnel-2017) and director Han Dong Hwa ( 38 Task Force, Miss Lee) with the hope of bringing to life this story’s heartwarmingly atypical friendship between 70 year old Shim Deok Chul ( Park In Hwan) , and a young man his early 20s Lee Chae Rok ( Song Kang) who are both united through their shared adoration of ballet . A heartwarming friendship tale, Navillera tackled some profoundly upfront issues about ageism, mortality, mental and physical illnesses as well as social prejudice also.

Park In Hwan was undeniably brilliant with his role as our main protagonist Shim Deok Chul. Although older characters are not uncommon in K-dramas , it was a breath of fresh air to come across a character in his twilight years who took central stage as a less glamorised or “ fresher” protagonist in a Korean drama with an equally heartbreaking character growth over the course of the series .

Naturally, it is important to respect South-Korean culture and expectations, however, ‘ Navillera’ pivotal focus is highlighted by the peculiar friendship between two individuals of different ages, with different backgrounds and personalities, who learn to surpass these boundaries through their friendship. Deok Chul respects Chae Rok both as his teacher and being his “ manager”, both inside and outside of the practice room. This allows Deok Chul to take on both the “encouraging figure” and the “friend role” for Chae Rok by his kind actions and standing up for him especially against his young mentor’s rival Yang Ho Beom ( Kim Kwon). ( As well as developing a friendship with this individual also.)

This of course moves us onto the deuteragonist of ‘ Navillera’ Chae Rok. Whilst actor Song Kang’s previous performances have been a little stiff , he seemed to truly capture something vividly brilliant behind his character Chae Rok; a young ballet dancer caught between the pain of the past, and struggling to move forwards to a brighter future. Yet whilst ironically Chae Rok’s archetype does undeniably fall into the cliche of the “ young and good looking main character”, his role in the series is nonetheless just as multifaceted as Deok Chul. This did not push Chae Rok down the stereotypical root of being a ‘ heinous and bitter person’. He’s seemingly aloof and judgemental as well as quick to complain about Deok Chul, however, he is shown to constantly battle with loneliness due to the circumstances of his father Lee Moo Young ( Jo Sung Ah) . He possesses also a similar streak of altruism and kindness as Deok Chul, which manifests throughout his actions over the course of the series.

Over the course of 12 episodes, the duo’s friendship begins to truly bloom. Even Deok Chul’s normally hypercritical wife Choi Hae Nam ( Na Moon Hee) taking a later shine to the younger dancer .

However, against all odds of cliches,the side characters of the series were often given intriguing backgrounds also. Chae Rok’s mentor Ki Seung Joo ( Kim Tae Hoon) has had a complicated divorce and past due to his career as a former- ballet dancer and is determined to not let his young prodigy walk down the same route. Similarly, Deok Chul’s youngest son Shim Seong Gwan ( Jo Bok Rae) ‘s changed career decision often leads to tension during family meetings, whilst the eldest Shim Seong San ( Jung Hae Kyun)’s harsh attitude towards his daughter and wife is certainly more complicated than it seems whereas Deok Chul’s daughter Shim Seong Suk ( Kim Soo Jin) supporting her husband Byun Young Il ( Joong Hee Tae)’s decisions were equally endearing storylines .

Yet the notable story arc which should probably be mentioned along the way can be seen within the staged romance between Chae Rok and Deok Chul’s granddaughter and Chae Rok’s colleague Shim Eun Ho( Hong Seung Hee).There was nothing inherently “ terrible” about this romantic pairing.Eun Ho and Chae Rok were mutually respectful of one another , and shared common ground within their close relationship with Deok Chul. On the other hand, it is fair to say that whilst partially necessary for allowing both characters to overcome their own lack of self-esteem in different ways, the romance respectfully wasn’t the most intriguing or exciting part of the show.

Similarly, another major focal point of the series occurs within Yang Ho Beom’s long-held “ enmity” towards Chae Rok. Without revealing too much about the reasons behind Ho Beom’s contempt of Chae Rok ( due to feeding into the main storyline), it is pivotal to point out that this “ rivalry” begins to filter into the storyline many cliche events, though, this does gradually begin to fizzle out due to their circumstances. However, this is what was refreshing about Ho Beom as a character and minor antagonist . He was far from being a “flawless person ”, but, he wasn’t entirely shown onscreen as having “ no humanity” either. Without any spoilers , there is one particular scene in which Ho Beom later approaches and sits down for a meal with Deok Chul, in a heartwarming moment of the drama.

Besides some minor flaws of the series, the ending of “ Navillera” was bittersweet. An amazing ending point to see just how far the characters had come and the difficulties which Deok Chul is taking one step at a time.

It is easy for shows like “ Navillera” to become overwhelmed with cliches by detracting from the more important points of character growth and storyline. Admittedly, the drama didn’t entirely stray away from these angst-ridden tropes, however, they were used to screenwriter Lee Eun Mi’s advantage allowing "" Navillera"" to become a heartwarming, tearjerking from beginning to end about family, friendship and self-determination. An enjoying and heartfelt watch with prominent character-growth and pivotal and universal messages throughout.

As long as you have dreams achieving them is never late.
Words might never be enough to describe how much I loved this drama, from episode one till the end. There is nothing ordinary about this drama, a heartfelt story, a true MASTERPIECE.
Each episode will touch your heart, it'll make you rethink life decisions or help you to find a little bit of hope in your life, will make you laugh, cry, get upset about some characters and then forgive them as you'll get to know them better, I bet any person can find themselves in introduced personages like I often found myself in Chaerok and the battles he faced, I could relate to Eunho as well.
""Navillera"" left me hoping that all of us will get a chance at least once in our lives to soar freely, and feel true happiness.

First of all, let me tell you how proud Song Kang makes me feel. He is such a pro. He took ballet lessons for just six months to be able to play Chaerok's role and dance.
Producers of ""Navillera"" said that while Kang was filming his ballet scenes, all of the staff on set stopped breathing, and they were all drawn into his performance.
And seeing him dance which came about through an enormous amount of practice it was a certain shock to me as well. I was so moved by those scenes, all I could think about was how an amazing actor he is. It was majestic! Even though he had body-double for the hardest scenes that doesn't belittle his effort in learning how to balance himself, be able to carry the right posture, and do all the moves he had to do by himself. The dedication this man has!

I started this drama mainly for Song Kang since I am a huge fan of his. I haven't read webtoon so I didn't have any prior expectations. Tho I desperately wanted to see Kang dancing ballet.
Then I saw the trailer and that short video made me cry, so I already knew I had to prepare my tissues.

The story is about 23 years old Lee Charok a ballet dancer who was going through a slump and 70 years old Shim Deokchul who wanted to learn ballet from this young ballet genius. For 12 episodes you will observe how these two get to know each other, go through thick and thin together, how they overcome obstacles on their way, how haraboji starts treating Chaerok as his own grandchild, how they learn more and go towards their individual dreams together.
Navillera reflects on real-life a lot. All the characters are just like some people you might've met in real life, or even know them yourself. This drama showed how bittersweet life can be, that even though we suffer on daily basis with all different causes small happiness still can be found as well.
This drama shows so many aspects of life from different angles. How youngsters suffer to become something in life, how desperately they try to handle all the hardships that life gives them. How middle-aged people are striving to manage their lives that for now must have some shape but unfortunately for some that's not like it at all.
And lastly, the elders who are expected to have lived life the fullest and now they must live for their next generations. As if getting old gives you fewer rights to have dreams and work for them.
Drama gives you so many life lessons throughout the episodes and development of precious characters, shows you that coin always has two sides, that we shouldn't be quick to judge people, we shall give them time and get to know what's behind them, shows us how just a little bit of warmth and attention can save the day.

Out of all personages I loved Chaerok and Deokchul the most. I loved how their unusual friendship started and how their relationship turned into them becoming like a real family. Loved to watch how haraboji helped Charok to get on his feet again, how he helped this depressed boy, who suffered so much from life, who had nothing left except for few people around him and ballet get out from the slump that was holding him back. Also how Chaerok helped Deokchul and the people around him as well. They both supported one other throughout everything. They just stood by each other's side till the end.
Chaerok and Deokchul were each other's reflections. If Chaerok wouldn't overcome his slump, he'd end up like Deokchul who deeply regretted neglecting his own dream.
All the characters we met through the drama had meaning and hope with them, none of them were meaningless or insignificant. They all had their own place, they all had something to say, they all carried their own misfortune and success.

The acting was fascinating especially in the second half of the drama. Kang did such an amazing job, he really shined brightly and stood out a lot, every time he cries I end up crying double so yeah his individual and haraboji's scenes had me bawling my eyes out a lot.
Park Inhwan did a great job as well and all the cast members! They made me forget that I was watching a piece of fiction and not a real-life story.

If you are still wondering, rather give it a try or not, do so! You won't regret it. It's absolutely a must-watch
P.s don't forget to grab tissues, I cried during all episodes.

Dramas like Navillera aren’t always the type of dramas that I gravitate towards. Sometimes I feel like it’s little too slow and the plot is not that exciting. That really down to earth slice-of-life stuff is sometimes a bit too dull, so it’s always really nice when you do stumble upon one that really works for you. And Navillera is one of those dramas. I just knew from the first episode that this show was going to make me feel good and also make me cry so much, but like in a good way.

The tone here is warm, quiet and down to earth and the story itself is not very grand, as it would not fit the story that this drama is trying to say, and yet it truly grabbed me right away. There is a certain softness and wholesomeness that this story just exudes. It radiates warmth and kindness. There was always something so pleasant and comforting about tuning into this show every week and the message of chasing your dreams no matter where you are in life, and it’s never to late to try is beautiful.

Navillera is a really character-driven and character-focus story as we just follow these people throughout their daily-lives and their interactions with each other. There’s really nothing I’ve not seen before here. It’s a simple setup; Two very different individuals need to work together and somehow they were just what the other one needed. One character is cold and closed-off, the other is not. You’ve seen it before so many times, but it works, and the drama never seems boring despite the fact that you sort of know the story that’s being told because it has so much heart and tells the story well.

Chae Rok’s relationship with this grandfather that he has been tasked to teaches ballet is so wonderful and pulls at your heart every step of the way. Deok Chool is one of most adorable and wholesome character I’ve ever watched. He’s the heart of the show and wow what a big heart it is. Their relationship and Deok Chool’s determination to chase his dreams is going to make you get misty-eyed every episode of this show.

Song Kang and Park In Hwan do such a good job in these roles, although it is the latter who really carries the show on his shoulders, as his character is the heart of the show. They are both so sincere here though and that really shines through. All of the actors on this show do an amazing job to bring these fully fleshed characters to life. I felt like I understood everyone, why they did what they did and their attitude towards life, whether I liked them or not.

Often I feel like these types of dramas tend to drag on for a bit or the story isn’t big enough for the drama itself, not enough history to be to fill in all the episodes but Navillera uses it’s time really well and never really drags on. It rather chugs steadily on while focusing on the character and their relationship in a really sincere way. And it certainly helps that Navillera is only 12 episodes, but not the usual 16, like kdramas tend to be.

There are certain things that I found predictable within the story, especially as it descends into the latter half and the stakes rise a little bit, but it never got on my nerves and I never found it too bleak. It sometimes filled me up melancholy but because the drama set all of these things up really well these things never came out of nowhere. I was prepared. And there is a certain string of hope that persists within the story despite the lingering sadness that was present within the story. Hope always seems to shine through.

The story may be a little standard, a bit after the book at times, but I can not fault the drama because of it because it set everything up very well, it builds up to things, it lays all the groundwork, the character were good, everything that happened seemed earned and not just randomly thrown into the story. It was the story it wanted to be. Plus, the story has a huge heart. So even though I always sort of knew where it was heading. Everything somehow came together really nicely. I got pretty much everything I wanted and expected from this, which was satisfying. It’s like a good home-cooked meal that your mom makes. You get what you expected, but it’s nice.

New word for meaningful and awesome should be Navillera
Once in a while you come across a drama that is not only well written, superbly acted out and has a powerful message, but at the same time it’s also a drama that comes into your life when you didn’t know you needed it and packs such a punch, that it makes you to re-evaluate your life. This was Navillera to me.

The story is incredible – it creates an amazing contrast between a coming-of-age story, and “let’s give it all I have when I still have some time left” story. Navillera shows the perspective of two very specific heroes, with such a different view on life and experiences in it, that it’s just incredible that it manages to work so well. It’s also a prime example of inter-generational learning and shows how beneficial it can be for one’s life.

I found the charm of Navillera mostly in the small things. The dialogue is written very realistically, and the characters interact with one another the way real people would. There is one scene where haraboji receives a gift and he automatically replies: “But orange is my favourite colour.” That made me laugh so much and miss my family in a way – it’s something so familiar to have “assigned” your favourite colour to make picking out gifts easier. The drama also leaves small messages for attentive viewers to pick up on, as well as it does a good job in tying everything together at the end.

Most of that is thanks to a reasonable tempo and twelve episodes. Everything feels just right, there are no filler episodes, and every scene has a meaning. The acting is nothing short of spectacular, even the side characters have their moments. It’s very rewarding to see fully fleshed plot lines and developments in this setting of high-level acting. Not to mention the sheer amount of preparation that both Song Kang and Park In Hwan had to do. I was in awe at some of their scenes. This drama also featured several strong female characters and that made my heart melt.

It will be a long time until I come across a drama like this. It was deeply meaningful and made me look at my life with a different eye. It’s amazing, honestly, how they created this drama in a way that it feels natural for you to do so. It’s almost as if you are a part of the conversation.

Navillera also shows some aspects of family life in such raw state, that I got emotional several times in moments without the main characters present. I would also like to comment on how tasteful and respectful the creators were towards some scenes involving the main heroes dressed in ballerino outfits. Honestly, it was just beautiful.

I liked the OST as well – the contrast of modern music and classical ballet music was excellent.

I know, this drama might trigger a lot of people who have or have had a similar health situation with a family member, myself included. However, it made me think a lot about that certain dear person, I returned to some memories that I have not thought about in years. It made me find a bit of peace and it was healing. On the other hand, be ready to maybe stop watching Navillera for a couple of days when things get though (I did for two weeks) – but please, stick to the end. It’s the most rewarding drama you’ll ever see.

Oh, and P.S. you’ll cry a lot. So switch from handkerchiefs to toilet paper roll. It saves a lot of hustle. You’re welcome.

Do you soar?
Hands down this is the most wholesome and heartwarming K-drama I've watched.

A story that remind us it is never too late to chase our dream.
At first, I'm not really interested in watching old man doing ballet. I started watching it to past my time and Song Kang is the main lead, so i give it a try. Oh boy, I was wrong. The plot of how an old man that knows his time is short due to his sickness, found his long lost dream again and starting to pursue it just manage to pulled me in. Even though I find that in the middle of the stories I got bored can't fault the plot due to this is a slice of life drama (there will be no action that will excites us), but I still wanted to know how Grandpa and Chae Rok are going to soar. This shows that the character manage to drew us in as an audience. I manage to cry the whole last 3 episodes of this drama. I can't express how wholesome this drama is.

I have got nothing to say about the cast, all of them are great especially grandpa and Song Kang.

The most memorable and impactful line in this drama is right at the end ""Do you soar?"". After hearing it, I feel like I have been smashed with feels.

Deeply moving and inspiring
""Did you soar?""

I would say „Navillera“ is no light watch. Of course, there are some funny scenes and happy episodes, but as the drama progresses, it becomes increasingly somber and in the last few episodes I cried my eyes out. You should go into this drama with the right expectations - don’t expect romance or a comedy.
But if you are ready for a story about dreams, friendship, family and finding happiness, it will touch you deeply.

I am not sure what kind of action-packed dramas people who think this is „boring“ or „slow“ are used to, because I thought the pacing was perfect. There was never a dull moment or a filler episode and the drama had the perfect amount of episodes. I wish more dramas would cap at 12 episodes, because after episode 12 is often when they become dragged out and the writers add unnecessary drama.
The ending scene was absolutely perfect!! Everything about it: The cinematography, the dialogue, even the styling! I cried like a baby!

The performances of Song Kang and Park In Hwan are incredible. On top of their acting, I have so much respect for them for learning ballet for this drama, when they have never done it before. I know that they used body doubles for the more challenging scenes, but you can tell that the actors put a ton of hard work into credibly portraying ballet dancers.

Stories about friendship between someone young and old are always very touching and inspiring, and „Navillera“ is no different. The impact Chae Rok and Deok Chul have on each others’ lives and how it transforms not only them but the people around them, is beautiful and heart-warming.

Initially, I thought this was about an old man fulfilling his dream. But it is so much more than that. Every character is a little lost and looking for their happiness and they all eventually have to make a decision - to continue living life they way they are used to or take a chance and do what makes them happy. Coming from a country that is very much about corporate careers and performance, this drama feels very important.

All the characters go through credible character development and enrich the story with their own personal journeys to happiness. I really enjoyed Chae Rok’s relationship with Eun Ho as well. They mostly bond because of Deok Chul and there is no forced romance but they are important to each other. In the end, it is up to the viewer to decide whether they might find love in the future. I personally like the thought that they will fall in love at some point and Chae Rok will become a forever member of the family.

Like I said, it is no light entertainment. It made me think a lot about my own life, about the transience of all things, my aging parents and unfulfilled dreams. But it ends on a very hopeful note and leaves you inspired to find the thing that makes you happy and soar yourself.

Sad, funny and absolutely beautiful
This drama is a bit like the last walk on a gorgeous beach att sunset with the dog you love but have to put to sleep... Its a walk you will remember, the scenery is breathtaking, the waves will tickle you and make you laugh, the dog will look at you with its sweet innocent ayes reminding you of the joy and laughter you have sheered all while you are constantly aware of the end a head. While eating Ice cream (one each, since its the dogs last meal) some bird will scare you and make you angry... but you will also feel comforted by the dog, the taste of the ice cream, the last warming sunbeam and the sound of those amazing waves... or something like that... what I am trying to say is that this is a drama that will simply make you feel allot of emotions while beautifully portraying some of the worlds most important and relatable issues.

To be honest I do not really care to much about the message of it never being to late or what not that many seem to appreciate NO, I fell for its humor and its way of portraying both gender issues, ageism and ableisem in a humanizing and humoristic way. Showing that people of all ages and ability can be competent, fragile and have hopes and dreams...

This drama is packed with witty dialog such as:
70 yr old: What about your parants?
23 yr old: My dad lives somewhere else and my mom is dead
70 yr old : I se both my parants passed away
(Yes this mad me laugh, and is just my type of humor)

Confronting gender issues:
23 yr old: When a man announces he is going to do ballet his family's response is similar to that of the five stages of grief

I love also the way it shows different kinds of relationships and the importance of finding at least one person who believes in you and is willing to support you threw hard times, as well as showing the other side of the coin. Conveying the importance of communication and beautifully showing the negative effect lack of support from the people we care most about have on us. No matter how much we try to deny it or look away we get hurt (even injured) and accomplish allot less if the ones we care about do not support us. Oh And we also get to learn a bit about ballet.

There is one side story that feels a bit unnecessary that could bring down the score and I won't say this drama is perfection or even close to it but as a whole this dramas extremely beautiful cinematography, representation, dialog and feel to it makes up for all that and makes it worthy of ten stars and a place among my favorit dramas.

So yes this is definitely a must watch!

movie-firecracker
movie-firecracker
This is my first ever review so I can make a lot of mistakes, sorry. I feel like saying a lot, but I will try not to spoil it, so keep it short.
I've been watching Korean dramas for a year. Now and can't mess around with Hollywood and European productions (they're weak compared to that), but this series is a movie-firecracker.
A delightful story of relationships and beautifully shown how the past can overwhelm and how as you go through life, this burden can be lifted off your shoulders thanks to the people you meet. Of course, you have to be able to listen and hear, and in this film, young and old and even ""bad people"" know how to listen
Greatly chosen actors (all of them) for their roles. In fact, it's hard to say that someone plays the best, because even small roles are great in this film.
Sound and music and light, the next three actors who starred in this movie thanks to all the people in the production, wow but how brilliantly they are used ....
It terrifies me how mean parents can manipulate their children and adult children ruthlessly manipulate their old parents. After watching the whole movie, I learn that you have to take the man as a whole and not just focus on his faults, there is a place for everyone.
(I translate from Polish thanks to Google Translate, so maybe not everything is as I would like).

Must Watch ...!
Just simply one word to describe Navillera, - ""Excellent""..

I always had that faith in these type of melodramas, with a very intense slice of life story telling that will not let u feel disappointed. It has many thing to say to you, It will teach you so many things.

Here Its an adaptation of a popular webtoon, the story of a friendship between a young ballet dancer and a old fellow who dreaming to become a ballet dancer. Its sounds very strange that an old man learning ballet at that age, but this whole drama make this strange thing impossible..

The bonding and the family relationships are one of the best factor that the drama tells at it's best and very beautiful way, you will get so emotional especially when coming to it's finale Episodes. There are so many beautiful moments that u cannot forget that easily. Song kang done an absolutely brilliant job to deliver those wonderful emotions with that character, learning ballet was not an easy task but i heard he spent almost 6 month to do that, his efforts are paid off, that Haraboji and his family was also amazing. That climax was so touching and heart warming... You must watch this drama if you are a slice of life drama fan.. Full satisfaction

A superb adaption in 12 episodes of valuable lessons…
Navillera is a gem amongst mini dramas.

It reminds us that age is merely a number, and it’s never too late to chase your dreams by learning the value of time and the measure of our lives in order to pursue it.

Mr. Sim wanting to learn ballet at such advanced age is a defiance of all odds and beliefs.
Yet when almost everyone disbelieved of his success, he still wanted to give it a go, so that he could soar at least once in his lifetime.

ChaeRok, is struggling and he doesn’t know why, but he is lonely and hurting inside while stubbornly pushing himself without a care for his self being when it comes to ballet.

When these two opposite individuals are placed together as student and teacher, that’s when the life lessons start for one another, and the development of both characters and everyone around them is simply remarkable to say the very least.

“I don’t remember how I got there. I just heard some music and saw a ballerina before me.
The boy soared, and he reminded me of the ballerina I once saw when I was little.
Ever since that day, the sight on him dancing was burned into my mind.”

The pace of the drama and the changes they did compared to the webtoon are pleasant and actually work well, evenly blended with an amazing OST at the right times.

“I’m not such a weak person. I really love ballet. I want to do it well.”

And the dance scenes are mesmerizing, especially when ChaeRok dances with the first snow fall on the street, or when Mr. Sim does it too to show him how he improved. It’s two emotional scenes that portray their unique friendship and bond that they formed throughout the series.

It shows us that the definition of family is wide and not narrow to only family members.

ChaeRok being welcomed by such warm and caring hearts of the old couple, it’s like he ends up regaining a sense of family and is invited into a sweet home where there are people who care for him. It’s probably one of the many factors that helped to melt his cold and broken heart and of course his demeanor as we can see from the beginning of the story.

He grows so much and shows how kindhearted he can truly be, showing his true strength on his ongoing support for Mr. Sim, even more so when he discovers the secret the old man is trying so hard to keep.

Redemption is something that many characters here learn eventually.

Mainly the eldest son of Mr. Sim and HoBeom, I believe those two have the best change of hearts, when they come to accept their own realities and how different their lives turned out because of certain life choices and ordeals they have faced along the way.

Ballet was something he and most members of the family were up against, almost making them fall apart and yet further into the drama, Ballet is also what brings them all together.

Inspiring, could be the very definition of this drama.

To inspire us to seek further, to overcome our fears of failure and dive ahead and live while we can. Because time stops for no one, and life is an unpredictable variable that we can’t always control but that we can try to follow, to think of ways to improve ourselves or learn how to adapt to our current situations.

To trust in one another and support each other in times of need.

We spend so many times busy and worried about our own lives, that we often forget that as we age so do our parents and loved ones. And as much as we struggle nowadays, so did they in different times and circumstances. That’s one thing we do take for granted, until it’s too late.

“Every single day is precious. Because I don’t have much time left.”
“Even, if you don’t remember me, I’ll remember you.”

Make every moment count, cherish the little moments of happiness.
Support others in their dreams, don’t bring them down.
Lift others so they can soar, and one day so will you.
That’s what the message of this drama is all about.

Life lessons, taught by a 70-year-old man, and a 23-year-old guy that met by chance in a ballet studio. United by their passion for dancing and wanting to soar on stage at least once.

Definitely worth watching, such a heartwarming and emotionally moving drama.

“Did you soar?”

He did.

Can clichés soar?
Kudos to the creators for putting an elderly man in the front seat of a major drama. We need more stories featuring older people. And it's great to make a story that breaks gender stereotypes, especially in such a patriarchal society. However, that's pretty much where the praise ends.

Unfortunately, the story is nothing but clichés and predictableness. It wouldn't have been so terrible if the challenges faced by each character were presented with more depth, but on top of the clichés, the script was so generic that it seemed like every character was saying the same thing over and over again. Every person was simply there to tell us to ""do what we truly want to do"". Our ballerinos, the former doctor, the failed politician, the ex-football player, the white collar worker, his counsellor wife, and their daughter seeking her first job, had the same challenges and the same script.

Of course, Park In Hwan as our grandpa ballerino is the obvious highlight. Despite the terrible script, he delivered each line with wisdom and quiet, thoughtful strength. His talent came out but he deserved so much better material to showcase what he has to offer. Song Kang as our young ballerino Chae Rok was directed to play his part with too much annoying angst at the beginning and then his transformation didn't even get to breathe. One day he just changes, and the transformation of the entire cast is presented in the same way. There is no real progression. Kim Kwon as the blonde haired punk did well too, despite the shoddy script and lack of dimension in his character. The scene where he is leaning over Chae Rok in the stairwell gave us a glimpse of his acting talents. Finally, the relationship between ballet instructors Seung Joo and So Ri was the only one that provided a tiny bit of interest, but only a few drops.

I started watching this one night when I was absolutely exhausted and wanted something that demanded nothing from me. However, the lack of depth and the absolutely terrible script made it hard to get through. In the end, the talent and time was wasted even though I did smile and tear up a few times. And watching the professional dancers was a treat.

Now THIS is how you direct, write and produce an outstanding show!
This is by far one of the BEST Kdrama shows ive ever seen. The storyline was unique, warm, engaging and cute lol the acting superb! Wow wow wow! Hands down this show needs to be at the top.

The storyline is so heart warming and the character development is so good! The pacing of the show keeps you engaged and I love the relationship between Mr Sim and Chae Rok. Even the cute little things Mr Sim does like his exercising (the funniest moment was when he is at the park on that swinging thing lol) and the loving things he does for his kids.

If you are contemplating watching this, watch it you wont be disappointed!

Such a Beautiful Masterpiece
First of all, I am not someone who writes a review for any drama or movie I watch, but I felt the strong need to express my emotions for this beautiful masterpiece.
Where should I start, a very heartwarming, tear-jerking story about how we all need a Guardian Angle someone to support us as we follow our dreams. Someone to simply tell you ""Don't worry I got you"". The relationship of Chae-rok and Harabuji is simply like that or to be precise this is kind of the main theme of the story.
This feels like random rambling than a proper review but that's what this drama does to you it glows your heart in the warmest way possible.
All characters main and supporting have a story to tell including the anti-hero characters. I guess that's the beauty of this show.

One more last episode is remaining I hope it will still glow my heart tomorrow.

We absolutely don't deserve this masterpiece.
This show is such a hidden gem. I cannot even explain it to you how much it means to me. I cried in almost every episode because how deeply it moved me.
My favourite characters are obviously Duk Cheol and Chae Rok. Their relationship is so beautifully crafted and every character had such a good character development, especially Beom (the blonde guy) and Seong San.
This show... damn..
Words can't explain how beautiful this show is.
I also loved Hae Nam's character. In the beginning, she was against of Duk Cheol doing ballet but when she finally accepts it, it is the most beautiful thing ever. She's so supportive of her husband; she respects his dreams so much and it's so lovely. I loved Seong Hwan, Eunho and her mom.
Also, we don't deserve to see Song Kang in a ballet costume. He looks like a literal God. It's so cute and adorable that by the end of the show, Chae Rok becomes a family member ❤
I recommend this show to everyone. It's such a masterpiece ?

Seeking the chance without regret
Beautifully written and directed tale of chasing after your dreams and hopes regardless of external factors, whenever they are your age, family, social expectations or past demons keeping you away from taking that chance.

The true start of the show was Shim Deok Chul played by Park In Hwan. Both, how the character was written, and then portrayed on screen made me, as a viewer, relate to him, empathize with his journey and root for his success, even tho, practically speaking, we had close to nothing in common. The story was so touching and beautiful that it left me dehydrated coz of all the crying (worth to mention, not all the tears were sad).

Acting wise, I had a small beef with Song Kang - his emotional scenes were just… not emotional. The sadness, fear, loss, frustration his character was supposed to feel, were not translated and presented via his acting well. The rest of the cast did amazing job. Some would be harder to judge, since not all the characters were written in the same, complex way - but none caught my attention because of their inadequate performance.

Sadly, Shim Deok Chul's arc was both the blessing and the curse of the drama. All the other plot lines felt flat when compared - there were just too many characters that at the end of the day, were relaying the same message. Dropping some characters from the script, and allowing the rest to present better structured and developed plot lines could have potentially elevated the quality of the overall storytelling quite a bit.

The production quality was, dare I say, perfect. Props to Song Kang double and everyone involved for filming the ballet scenes in a way that was consistent and it did not feel like I’m watching two completely different people doing completely separate takes of the same scenes.

The OST is one big bop, having both slower, sentimental songs and faster tracks. All fitting the scenes that they were used for.

Overall, it was a ride that, at times, was tough to emotionally deal with, but still worth all the tears. It did not leave me completely depressed, as I was fearing, taking into consideration used themes. What I’ve got was a beautiful conclusion to a beautiful story.

A VERY GREAT SLOW BURN (a review from an amateur but really do love kdramas)
I knew this kdrama would break me and when it did I still was very emotional about it. This was one of the kdramas that would leave you feeling empty when it ended. I know that because it's what happened to me (and still is happening to me wtf, let me move on pls).

The main characters and their growth is everything. The OSTs suit to every scene. The cinematography?? Pretty AF. Seriously, this series was just very well-thought, directed, edited and shot.

I loved it all but (this is a good but okay dw) episode 8 made me cry so bad, like ugghhhh the build up to that??? Was f*ckin amazing!!! Now that is what you call a great slow burn. Song Kang doing ballet in that particular episode is now forever engraved in my mind.

Seriously, if you've watched A Moment To Remember and you loved how it emotional it was, then this kdrama is for you. Actually, if you're into slow-paced kdramas that is emotional and the characters have character development and simply a quality content kdrama, this is for you.

I can't express well my love for this kdrama and put it into words but it really was great. I loved it. It was perfect.

Honestly, this drama caught me off guard. I initially watched this because I just wanted to see more of Song Kang. But wow, just wow. I'm really glad I did watch it.

Even though this drama only had 12 episodes (I only found out it has 12 eps when I was in ep 8, was really bummed when I found out tbh), it made me feel a whole array of emotions. Firstly, it made me feel annoyed how SK and his mentor were treating the grandpa. I felt bad for the Grandpa when he was practicing. I felt happy when he passed the test. I felt disappointed when his family didn't support him. I didn't understand well why the his children were always arguing. I felt angry and sad and hurt when they talked back to their parents (the grandpa and grandma).

There were three things I really loved about this show. 1. The relationship of the grandma and the grandpa - even after all these years they still love and respect each other. 2. The relationship of the Grandpa with his granddaughter - this made me envy them actually. I wish I was that close and open also to my grandparents. 3. Lastly, the wisdom they share - I think this is my most favorite in this show. Because when they share their words of wisdom to one another, you can feel that they are speaking from the heart and not just empty words.

This drama was so realistic, so relatable. I think this is what has drawn me into it. During the first few eps, I was actually not anticipating the end of the drama because in my head, I was anxious that something bad will happen to the grandpa. I'm just glad that they decided to end the drama in the way they did.

Kudos to the team. Now, unto the next drama.

One word: Beautiful
I think this show aired at the right time for me. I could put myself in the shoes of the granddaughter (and other characters at times), especially because my grandfather also has Alzheimer's (maybe that's also why I caught the hints so early on, too?) and I am having the same thoughts about my future. I think I cried almost every episode after that was initially 'revealed.' I related so much to this show. It was made even better by the wonderful production, the amazing cast, and the enthralling story line. Everyone felt so *real*, so human. It was just wonderful to see how people are so faceted. (This show was character-based, and I loved seeing the character arcs for everyone.) I just really love this drama. It's become my all-time favorite drama now. Up until the last second (literally), I loved everything that they did. The ending was so beautiful. I just (as you can tell) have no words to properly explain how good this show is. I highly recommend it to everyone. It was done so well.

The drama that made me cry in episode 1
Navillera is the beautiful, heartwarming story of a man in his twilight years trying to finally pursue his dream. It's a show that embodies the mentality ""it's never too late to start."" It's also the story of the most unlikely of friendships as SDC, a man in his 70s looking to pursue ballet, and LCR, a man in his 20s who excels at his craft but is too lost and unmotivated to give it his full attention meet. These two make this drama. The supporting cast is amazing, too, with characters that each have their own personal growth and stories throughout the series, but it's the leads that steal the spotlight. Their interactions are some of the most wholesome things I've ever seen, they're inspirational, and seeing them help each other get back up when they've been kicked down is enough to bring you to tears.

That brings us to my gripe with this drama. The tears, or lack thereof. This is really going to be dependant on your tastes so you may have liked this, but personally, I was turned off of the series by the shoehorned-in Alzheimer's plot. I'm fine with Alzheimer's being present in dramas and I think it's an important talking point because it affects so many families worldwide, but I wasn't particularly fond of the way it was implemented here. In this drama, Alzheimer's is mainly used to up drama and make the viewer emotionally invested. That's fine in other narratives, but I feel that it just wasn't necessary here. I felt emotional in the early episodes before Alzheimer's became the main focus. I teared up in the beginning because the story was just so beautiful and inspirational. It didn't need more drama, it didn't need more angst and it was already making me cry. Navillera thrives on its very human, everyday atmosphere. Sometimes ordinary life is heartbreaking enough. You don't need to have a terrible illness or disease to go through hardships in life or to make the viewers feel for the characters. So when ballet started taking a backseat to characters having revelations about SDC's condition, characters crying over SDC, and SDC himself reminding us that he doesn't have much time left, my eyes dried up. Yes, it was sad, but it made me feel like those scenes were added just to pull at my emotions, so I didn't get teary-eyed or emotional over it. I haven't caught up with the webcomic yet, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly certain that Alzheimer's isn't a plot device in the source material and it was just added into the drama for, well. Drama. Again, I've started reading it but haven't caught up, so I could be wrong here.

I wish that the writer and director were confident enough in their story not to add in little melodramas like that. There were other instances, like with the youngest son's backstory of being a doctor who left his field after his patient died or the situation with LCR's dad, that were just added in for what feels like the same reason, but the Alzheimer's took up a large majority of the plot in the second half of the drama so it was the most glaring. The simple story of a man trying to pursue his own goals at an age where most people would have considered his life over was powerful enough on its own. The relationship between him and LCR as his instructor was amazing and heartwrenching all on its own.

Despite my gripes, I still love the drama. It's different and unique, and I do understand why dramas have such a tendency to fall on these tropes and cliches. It's a drama. It needs to be dramatic. But if the addition of the Alzheimer's subplot doesn't deter you, it's still a great story. The ending is satisfying, not great but it doesn't leave you wanting more, and the characters will stick with you for a long time afterwards. Give it a try.

such a beautiful slice of life drama :)) I enjoyed it but I wish it's not too slow. I watched this ongoing for the first 6 episodes and forgot about it until it's finished. the drama was good but since it's too slow to my likings I forgot about it. anyways, this is suchh a beautiful drama, from the first episode till the very last moment, it was very heartwarming, loving and basically soothing. The grandpa's character was a wholesome, you know it's one of the characters in this kdrama world where you just want to protect him at all cost. My favourite part of the drama is of course the grandpa and chae rok chemistry as well as the hardworking grandpa who never gives up on ballet. Also, this drama is full of beautiful messages and motivations, very uplifting and positive. the only downside would be it is too slow for me andd im not really interested with other characters stories huhu so i find it wasting my time during those part. but i enjoyed it regardless

Inspirational, Emotional and Hopeful
There are certain movies, series, books, etc. that come into your life at the right time, this series was like that for me, probably at any other time anyway it would have seemed beautiful and emotional, but in the present circumstances of my life and I imagine that in those of many (in partly because of the situation of global chaos that we live today) each of the messages of the series reached me deeply. The series has a very clear and strong message: ""It is never too late to start living your dreams"", which is presented in a very beautiful way.

The great virtue of the series are its characters, they all have something to say, a story to tell, here we do not have villains, or heroes incapable of making mistakes, each one, whether main, secondary or supporting, feels like real people, with problems, guilt and dreams, in each of them you can see your friends, family and yourself reflected.

The series does not throw blame towards anyone, and makes it clear that despite the circumstances in which you exist, at some point you must take responsibility for your own life and decide from there if you are satisfied or not with it and if you should go ahead or give it a spin.

It is so emotional because it touches very sensitive fibers for everyone, in modern life we have less and less time to ask ourselves how “happy” we are with our own life, things move so fast and all the time we have these non-existent voices that demand every more and more of yourself; ""You have to study, get the perfect grades, go to college, get the best job, buy more and more and more things to be successful,"" and in this roller coaster of responsibilities and obligations there is very little room to question whether everything really this makes you feel at peace with yourself, probably not, and you probably only realize it in a strong moment of crisis. Precisely this series, presents this to us, ""what if you stop for a moment, just a second, look around and question your own life.""

Shim Deok Hwan is one of the best characters I have seen in my life, he is a catalyst character, because rather than developing as such (which if he does) he drives all the characters around him to question everything; Deokhwan lived a life where he could not carry out his great dream but despite that he did not live a bad life, he loved and was loved, he built something good and above all he reached a point where he could leave behind grudges and pain, forgive and understood the decisions of the people around him, but now at this point in his life, in his 70 years, when his obligations and responsibilities to others have been covered, he decides that it is time to move on with his dreams, regardless of what he the rest of the world creates; this is how he embarks on this hopeful journey.

Chae-rok is a beautifully constructed character, initially plunged into a depression, acts rude and cynical but as he begins to spend more time with Deokhwan his barriers are gradually being destroyed, Chae-rok knows what he wants and also knows that he is good at it, but he is alone, his loneliness eats away at him, and also lives with guilt that is not his; in Mr. Shim he finds a family, people who support him and love him unconditionally and little by little he opens up to these people that he loves him, and learns to forgive those who hurt him by discovering how deeply human they are, which eventually gives the strength to fly, to achieve your dreams and push higher and higher. As a symbol, it seems to me, it is much more, it breaks in many ways the stereotypes of ""masculinity"" of the protagonist to which we are accustomed, he suffers, cries and cries seriously, in an emotional way, in front of other people, he is affectionate and fragile in sometimes, it's refreshing to have characters they exist so naturally in his world.

When you find what makes you happy, what you feel you were born to, it does not mean that the rest will be simple, even if you love it, you will have to work hard every day, to become better little by little, every day will continue to be a struggle, but at least it will feel like it is a fight on the right path and Navillera also presents that, for nobody is easy; Chae-rok is talented, yes, but even so he trains hard and many things are still a challenge for him, the rest of the characters experience a similar struggle.

Eunho and Seong San are two other very interesting characters due to their similarities, despite the age difference neither of them has found what makes them happy, and they live in the ""right"" way just because they think that's what they should do, their ideal of success is a good education and a good job, It doesn't matter in view of whom should bend the knee, but in the end they discover that it is not what want, that life is more than that, and that maybe it is time to stop a bit, to relax and experience success on your own terms. That's why that last scene of the two of them chatting at last, after spending the whole series without knowing how to communicate is so powerful, now they have each other to support each other in the difficulties they will have along the way.

Seong Gwan is also a character with many nuances, for years he has lived with a very great guilt for not being able to save the life of one of his patients, which prevents him from moving forward, he intends to record a documentary about life of that person to somehow make it important, but throughout history and as he lives more and more with his father, he realizes that instead of just thinking about the life he could not save, he can help others to having more time, he faces himself and his guilt and returns to the job that caused him so much fear, but now from a different perspective to help others.

One last character that I would like to address is Chae-rok's rival: Ho-beom, a young man full of anger, who abandoned his dreams and fills his existence with hedonism and resentment, little by little he comes to understand that everyone continued ahead in his own ways and he is the only one who is being left behind locked in his self-pity and that perhaps it is time to let go, so that he can start living again. As I mentioned, this series does not have villains, they are flesh and blood humans, and as humans we must recognize our ability to do evil, but also our ability to compensate or at least try to do it, we can change and we can be better, forgive ourselves to oneself is sometimes more difficult than to forgive others.

Seung Joo (Ballet teacher), Hae-nam, Seong Suk (Deokhwan's daughter) and Moo Young (Chae-rok's father) are also deep and interesting characters, who face their own challenges and dreams and further enrich the Navillera's world (but if i spoke of everyone, I'll be here for four years).

Each and every one of the characters, you are facing your own losses and broken dreams, but somehow you are all trying to build something else; at the end of the series, all the characters have grown up, but this is not a ""they lived happily ever after"", no, in the end everyone will have good and bad moments again, face other broken dreams and create new ones, the characters have matured.

Another point that I would like to touch on is the issue of Alzheimer's and old age, in my personal experience, especially with the second point, they are not topics that are very much covered in the Asian series, at least as far as the mainstream is concerned, especially for the importance given to aesthetics and beauty; aging is not a very pleasant process in most cultures and around this a phobia about aging and the people who live it has almost been created; in the series this topic is treated with great dignity, and yes, it is true that as you grow, your body and mind do not have the same capacities as in youth, but this does not mean that you become a useless person, nor does it take away the right to want to achieve your goals, there are venerable people from all ages we should pay attention to; with Alzheimer's a similar situation happens, there are many products that address this issue, some in a good way, others not, some from the perspective of the person and others from that of their close ones, the way in which Navillera does it is a perspective very early in the disease, where we are given glimpses, but in itself we do not see the hardest part of it, but in the same way this is treated with great respect and dignity and where the reactions of the people around the affected person they are very honest.

Finally, the performances, the truth is that everyone does a wonderful job, but for me all the palms go to Park In-hwa and Song Kang; every time Deokhwan went into a crisis, you could feel in his eyes the despair and fear of not knowing who you are, or where you are or who those around you are, I don't think it is an easy job to have convey those emotions to the public. I also think that physically it must have been a demanding role and the performance that he gave us was incredible; speaking of physically demanding, Song Kang… wow, not only in the ballet parts, that despite having a body double for some scenes, he does it wonderfully, but everything else, his acting is impeccable, you feel each of the emotions of his character, you see through his eyes the struggle and pain and passion with which life is faced, and the chemistry between the two actors is so tender that you really feel this kinship between them. I would also like to give a big applause to the montage, for obvious reasons, as neither of the two actors are professional Ballet dancers, the dances themselves are not presented one hundred percent, but because of the way in which the scenes are mounted make you feel the beauty and elegance of the Ballet.

Navillera is a very beautiful series, of course it is optimistic and sweet, but sometimes you need to see things like that, it is a series made with a lot of love, which talks about the deep experience of being human, I hope that people who see it can feel a little of what I felt and how much it inspired me to just keep going, but above all I hope that everyone has the opportunity to find what makes them feel proud of being human and that everyone can fly, even just one once in your life, i hope.

it's never too late to pursue your dreams
This beautiful tear jerker of a drama will break your heart then stitch you back together again. A wonderfully pitch perfect story about a 70 year old man who decides finally to pursue his dream of being a ballet dancer.
And while you'll no doubt sob through the whole thing, it's a cathartic cry, a healing cry. One that will fill you up and let you leave the drama completely satiated.

This is a beautiful drama that is not even bittersweet but just an ordinary story about ordinary people learning to live their lives to the fullest and that it's never too late to pursue your dreams.

If you don't love the characters, the story, the cinematography and the themes, you will at least love the music, which completes the emotional journey perfectly.

Just perfect

Butterflies and Ballet
Much like the image of the butterfly and the soul in poetry and art, this series is superb, sweet, and compassionate with the grace and elegance of ballet as the frame for the deeply touching real story. The cast, direction, cinematography, and writing are outstanding: not a misstep anywhere as all involved work to tell the story of discovery, friendship, love, support, forgiveness, and healing. Filmed with such love and gentleness, this is one of Korea's finest series in its relatively short but brilliant history. I cried a lot, especially in the second half, but the tears were because I was so moved by the script, actors, and story they told so well. Strongly recommended.

What a beautiful, heartwarming, inspiring drama!
Navillera is the kind of drama that tells you that your dreams are valid, no matter how out of reach they might appear, Navillera tells you that if you give it your best and hold onto it, you can return to them and fulfil them one day.

Adapted from a manhwa, I felt that the creators did a beautiful job portraying both the characters and the story. From a well written plot to complex characters whose relationships with each other are filled with growth and hope, we have it all. My favourite character was of course the seventy year old lead, Deok Chul. Such a positive, hopeful man always empathetic and understanding of everyone around him. He was such a comforting personality to be around — especially to the younger generation around. I absolutely loved his dynamics and friendship with Chae Rok (his young ballet instructor). These kind of dramas are hard to come around, and I’m so glad it was made.

Having read the webtoon before watching this, I was a little nervous about the casting, but they chosen actors were perfect for their roles! From main characters to the supporting characters, no one felt out of place or incomplete. I also loved the OST, it perfectly went with the story and added onto the emotions.

Finishing this was a sad feeling, saying goodbye to these beautiful characters was hard. But I came out of this experience with a lot of comforting thoughts. In the end, this drama is a warm hug that everyone needs.

""if you have a heartbeat, there's still time for your dreams"" That's the qoute the drama follows. This drama is a heart-warming tale of an old man discovering his hidden passion. It makes you cry from happiness, like a warm hug from someone you love in the first half and in the second half it makes you bawl like a baby. So prepare a lot of tissues before watching this one haha.

Although the main focus of the drama is about an old age man finally learning ballet, it doesn't only revolve on him. I feel like the best thing about this drama for me was that it paid attention to all of its characters, from the main ones to the supporting ones. It doesn't feel forced and just feel real and raw. Every character has their story of their own, own flaws and strengths and we see them grow. There's no antagonist. You're gonna shed tears for the Characters you hated in the beginning or atleast I did lol

I also love how the characters are connected to one another. Sure a quarter of them are family but the other relationships are formed very unusually. At first they want to use one another for their own benefit but gradually they start forming deep emotional bonds, a friendship that'd last forever. The relationships of every character with one another was truly amusing and a delight to watch!

Another thing I love about it is that the drama realistic portrays Korean households where old folks and house wives usually don't get to live their dreams and men of the house have to have a rich job. It shows the struggles of Korean society. The struggles of people from different age range. It addresses different social problems in such a subtle and beautiful way that it captured my heart.

We have a character who's finding her own dreams, a character who couldn't follow his dreams, hardships of being in a society where people demand you to be stable no matter what, the hardships of being a new mother and working woman , the hardships of not having a dream etc etc. I loved how the main theme of the drama is following your dreams and that it's never late to follow them but it also tells us that even if you don't have a dream, it's ok. Just live your life the way you want to and do what makes you happy.

The acting from everyone was just amazing from everyone. I haven't seen song Kang act before becuase of his choices in dramas ( he always chooses cringy rom-coms I don't watch lol ) but he definitely did a good job here! Other actors are simply incredible as always!

The OSTs were also good enough and I had no problem with the music.

I am not professional and I know nothing about ballet actually but the ballet they did in this drama was believable and beautiful in my eyes so I have no problem on that. So there you go, it's a 10/10 drama cuz I see no flaws and I loved it so much.

If you're wondering if you should watch it or not then let me help you out by breaking it down :

You should watch it if :

• You like dramas that make you cry
• You like character-driven dramas
• You like dramas that address social issues
• You like family-oriented and dramas with strong friendship
• if you wanna see some beautiful ballet

You shouldn't watch it if :

• You don't like dramas that make you cry
• You don't like slice of life dramas where there's not much action
• You want romance in your dramas cuz there's NO romance in this one
• if you ONLY want to see ballet cuz even though it has ballet scenes there's not much and there's more to the story
• If you don't want to watch stories with old people as main characters

Well I guess that's it. Thanks for reading my review if you did. If you I made you help decide if you should watch this masterpiece or not or if you just simply enjoyed reading my review, I'm more than glad!

Heartwarming drama as well as a Tearjerker.
I’m not one to write reviews, I’m not good at summarizing and my grammar is bad, but please be patient with me. I’m going to keep it short and only say a few things about it. I found this drama when it had 10 episodes and I wish I found it sooner it just sucked me right in. At the end of every episode I wanted more so it’s sad that there’s only 12 episodes, I could watch 50. I cried a lot while watching this it’s just absolutely beautiful and inspiring... especially at the end of episode 10 beautiful scene. If you are debating watching it, please do you won’t regret it, I certainly didn’t. I’ve seen reviews about it being boring but I don’t think so it’s nice and simple and I like that, no unnecessary drama, the characters are so like able except one, you can be the judge on that. But I personally think this is the best drama of 2021 and nothing will change that for me. I said I would keep it short but I’m just rambling now.

average, boring
the first 2-3 eps were okay, an then it got boring.....bosan~~~ boleh tertidur hahah and until the end boring. predictable plot, but i thought at least it would be little bit more heartwarming and idk like can make me feel to try to put myself in the character’s shoes but nah that didn’t happen hahah maybe just a bit, during the earlier eps, cause i remember crying but tu je lah hahah the first 2 eps. then i just kept on watching cause i still wanna know the ending of the drama and i enjoyed the ballet. mostly the plot is just okay, ordinary and boring sikit, takde apa sangat pun. i’m glad that its only 12 eps and it was a good decision watching this while its airing hahahah. i remembered enjoying bits of the drama, but nothing really memorable. yea you can try watching it bolehla hahah but slow~~ but okayla kot~~~

A rare GEM... One of the BEST dramas I've seen...
Brilliant acting from the main leads and supporting actors. I became an instant fan of Song Kang after watching this. Mr. Park, whom I've seen in a lot a of dramas before continues to amaze me. I loved how original the story was, it was simply a heart-warming and inspiring story which was beautifully portrayed on screen. Every character (even those with supporting roles and those you would initially get annoyed with) had a back story that was told clearly so you can understand where each one was coming from and why they behave that way. The family frictions and individual struggles were all very real and relatable. The character development of Chae-rok from start to finish was executed well, I literally witnessed how Chae-rok matured in all those 12 episodes and how that relationship with Granpa made an impact on his life and vice versa.

This drama would really make you want to reflect on life after watching it. The lessons in this drama about forgiveness, moving forward, discovering your passion, pursuing your dreams and rising above adversities were conveyed so well by the different characters in the drama. There was nothing overly-dramatic or far-fetched in this drama unlike in the others I've seen, yet this drama will surely tug your heartstrings. I wish more people would discover and watch this drama, as this is truly a gem, This is indeed one the best dramas I've seen so far, and believe me I've seen quite a lot (though I rarely write reviews, just had to write one for this drama as it was truly exceptional). Hoping this drama will get an award, as it will be well-deserved.

Lastly, make sure to have lots of tissues handy, you'll definitely need it. =)

Just a really heartwarming drama!!
I'll make it short.
First, I never actually liked any of the projects song kang prevously chose, except for sweet home. Love Alarm, the vampire one, and none of them actually made him shine and had horrible characters.
But really, I'd like to think this drama as his debut drama if ever! His acting is like on point and I wont lie when i say i cried more than a couple of times watching this drama, not because its sad, but because its simply a really beautiful story!!
Chae Rok and Harabeoji has the most endearing relationship ever!! Like, I swear I'm not exaggerating! Their dedication and care for each other makes it more special!
The illness our grandfather here has-- I actually suspected it from episode 5-6 something, i assumed there was something wrong with him, watching their bond grow stronger because of that-- TT-TT
The youngest son of harabeoji and his granddaughter, eunho, harabeoji's wife and chaerok, and finally ho beom, they made this drama worth watching!!

If you're hesitating to watch this, because its about a man doing ballet or something like that, I urge you try this drama and i promise you wont regret it.

First time in 3 years I'm watching a drama that isn't focused on romance or mystery and didnt drop it yet-- I'm giving this a 10/10!!
The acting, the chemistry, the storyline, the ballet, the ost, and the visuals-- everything is highclass here!

Cliches and secrets central
I guess I saw where this was going from the first episode but i figured it was ok since the premise was new and unique. So the show wants to tell us to slow down and be kind to ourselves by doing what we want to do. The main character always wanted to learn ballet and finally decides to go for it. While at it, he touches younger people around him, especially, the young ballet guy, Chae-rok. Of course, as this is a K-drama, we find out that he’s diagnosed with the Alzheimer’s and doesn’t have much time. Sigh.

The good.
- Thank God for the absence of a love triangle.
- I loved the main character. Basically, he’s really the only one that was fleshed out. He’s gracious and easy going. Character traits I typically don’t associate with Korean men.
- As mentioned, I really liked the message even though I doubt hyper-competitive Koreans would ever change. Also, is it even possible to slow down and enjoy life in Korea?
- I gained a new appreciation for ballet. But is ballet any popular in Korea?
- I loved seeing Na Moon Hee. She’s almost 80 and she’s still doing her thing.
- I’m glad the main character achieved his dream but I wonder what real ballet people think about the old guy learning ballet so fast that he was able to do a solo/duo performance.

The bad
- Its annoying that once again, this K-drama writer resorted to secrets and miscommunications to push the plot forward.
- Keeping the Alzheimer’s hush hush made no sense as the affected person becomes a danger to himself. Let’s see how it goes attitude by his family and Chae-rok is absurd.
- The yellow haired kid’s victim mentality went a little too far, especially, when he started physically harming Chae-rok.
- I’m surprised that Chae-rok’s dad went to prison for corporal punishment in Korea.
- I’m not sure if there were any meaningful growth in characters. People were changed with little motivation. Just kinda happened.
- The entire time, I wondered what made Chae-rok special in ballet? They imply that he’s special but you never find out why. He’s way behind his peers at the beginning and you don’t see him getting anywhere.
- Young people in this show (except part time jobs at restaurant) don’t seem to need any job to survive.
- Main character’s family doesn’t add much to the show. They’re just cliche characters and represent different stereotypes.
- Please don’t let your elderly with the Alzheimer’s wander around alone. This keeps happening throughout the show.
- I feel like the show started strong but like most K-dramas, they had to take things too far once they introduced the Alzheimer’s angle. Please figure out a way to make things interesting without pushing things to the realm of absurdity. Lazy writing never works.

All in all, it’s a shallow, predictable story with enough cliches to fill up your room but I didn’t find it terribly except for the bit about how the characters handled the reality of the Alzheimer’s.

Lol I don't feel that strongly about this drama...
Another great drama by our favorite Netflix actor Song Kang. Despite the fact that I’m not involved in ballet whatsoever, I’ve always enjoyed anything ballet related for as long as I can remember. I was particularly excited for this drama because I enjoyed Song Kang in Sweet Home and thought the premise of this show was very interesting. While I did enjoy the drama, I found it a little too slow for my liking, and I struggled to develop a connection to any of the characters. Nevertheless, it was a nice drama that I could watch on Mondays and Tuesdays to make those days a little bit brighter. It wasn’t a drama I was too invested in, (I just think it’s too short for that) but had fun watching it casually and can appreciate the heartfelt and simple storyline. Overall, I’d recommend this drama for those who like ballet, Song Kang, or slow and sweet melodramas.

A Piece that Tugs at Your Heartstrings
A short, sweet drama about family, ballet, willpower, resilience, and dreams. Although I know nothing about ballet, this drama taught me so much about dance. The beauty behind it, the emotions that support it, and your passion that keeps you going. If you're currently struggling about going after something you love, watch this! Although it has the cliche ""follow your dreams"" message, it's a refreshing watch and reminds you that age is simply just a number.

Story: Centered around a 70-year-old man trying to learn ballet, the plot unfolds slowly yet beautifully. The two main characters share a special relationship, one that says ""I always got your back"". However, the more personal part of this drama was the family love and the respect for others. Each couple in the family had their own problems yet the end was clear: as long as I'm here, we'll be okay. I was also relieved when the writers didn't force a relationship between Eunho and Chaerok; the focus of the drama was clear, and the unnecessary love stories were avoided. Overall, the plot is very intriguing and branches off to several sub-plots that make the drama more interesting and personal.

Acting: I've never seen any of Song Kang's works, so this is my first impression of him. And, he did not fail to disappoint. His character development was played perfectly by him. And can we mention how he learned ballet for 5-6 months? While watching, I was certain that this was a very experienced dancer...the turns, the positions, the elegance, and the emotion. Park In-Hwan was also magnificent. His character evoked so many emotions from me, ranging from pure happiness to heartbreaking pain. My tear ducts are dry because of many of his scenes. The couples were also cast perfectly! The way the director recruited some of the most famous Korean actors to play these roles shows how well the research was done.

Music: My Day by Taemin and Heal You by Ha Hyunsang. That's it. The soundtrack was composed perfectly to match the dynamic and warmth of certain scenes; the music literally painted the screen.

Please watch this short 12 episode drama if you're looking for something more personal, realistic, and heartwarming. This drama is a poem about relationships, an ode to love, and a reminder to never substitute your dreams for money. But be prepared, have a few tissues lying around. It does tug your heartstrings a bit.

Navillera, 12 hours of a perfectly written metamorphosis story.
A little boy sees a man wearing makeup and a funny little dress, his eyes shine with curiosity and he peers into the hall. The man twirls like the spinning top he plays with at home. His hands make delicate movements. Every single swish is with purpose, his eyes seem to follow a trail of fireflies as they form a halo around him, the audience stares in silence and the little boy can't hear his heartbeat over the music that had hypnotized his body. But his mesmerized self is brought to reality as his father yanks him away. The little guy asks his father, ""What is that?"" ""Ballet. But you don't have to pay attention to it."" Replies the father. A little boy knows nothing except what he feels and his soul left a piece with the dancing man.

Every single character in this drama is written with so much conviction and reason. It's like a game of chess where every single piece advanced. Whether they took two steps forward or circled the board twice, each piece broke out from the rules set by society and the hush of all the neighbors, to experiment with life.

I am going to miss the duo so much. I began every week knowing that I would cry my eyes out but also leave comforted. Navillera brought a warm hug and a bag full of chocolates. Ones I could savour because it brought the snow with it and so it wouldn't melt.

It touched my heart in so many ways and fulfilled me completely. There was not a single loophole, no overdoing, no dramatisation. This is a story about two men who learnt to let go of their fears and doubts and take flight. But the best thing was that they influenced the people around them and impacted their lives significantly.

Navillera will definitely strike a chord in you so why not do yourselves a favour and watch uri Halabeoji and Chae rok grow fond of each other and take a piece of your soul with them too. ✨

Must see!
Out of all the K-dramas I have seen, this was very original, in my opinion.

I absolutely loved this one. It's message that it's never too late to pursue your dreams was so inspiring. And the added message that you shouldn't delay because tomorrow isn't a guarantee.

It was also a tale of an unlikely friendship. I feel it also broke down a lot of stereotypes about men who do ballet.

I recommended this drama to my senior citizen parents and they actually finished watching the whole thing before I did. My mom went on to recommend it to other people their age as she found the message to be extremely inspiring and important for people who are older. She found the message to be hopeful too.

I have viewed a lot of heart-warming K-drama, but with this one, I cried A LOT and love this Kdrama for that!

Magnificently written, directed and performed by all involved.
I can't praise this drama enough. It's a beautifully warm-hearted, soft and cuddly film, with each character given a chance to soar. Even the unsympathetic, hateful ones - or those who at the start seem that way - are revealed as human, with their own strengths and struggles.
I seldom ever ever ever award 'marks' this high, but this deserves everything.
It seems to be making less of a splash than other dramas just now, but deserves much more notice. Perhaps because it's shorter, perhaps because there's nothing 'dramatic' going on, perhaps it's the age(s) of the cast.
I don't care. It's honest, emotional, and inspiring.
It may not be flashy (it's not) but it's still a jewel.

Need inspiration? You're on the right place!
Words can't express how I feel about this, not too short not too long, it's on the right pace for a slice of life drama. Emotional but not over dramatic only real emotions. The cast did justice to the drama especially the main leads, nothing seemed off, acting was so on point with a perfect chemistry.
The OSTs fits perfectly with the drama ,my personal favourite was Taemin's My day the one that plays at the end of the episodes, I already had it on loop for days.
Overall if you like heart warming stories with no expectations of much suspense , you should definitely watch Navillera!

Now I'm emo
I just want to fight the writers of this drama for making me cry that much. Y'all need to cut me some slack, please.

I'm giving this show a 10 because I didn't find a reason not to - everything about this production is good. The concept, the storyline, the (flawed or not) characters, the pacing, the cinematography, even. I just wish Navillera had a full OST like most popular dramas do, but it's not a top priority for me at all, anyways. All the family progressed and developed that much in only 12 episodes, and by the end I was rooting for all of them.

A special shoutout to Park In Hwan for his acting - I've never watched his work but he portrayed his character (& his illness) perfectly here.

Also, it pleasantly surprised me that they did NOT give Chae-rok and Eun-ho a love story line. I'm happy that they remained friends. Friendship between men & women is something we need more often in K-dramas.

Definitely one of my favorites from 2021.
10/10.

Park In Hwan who played Shim Deok Chul was amazing in telling this story regarding Alzheimer's. South Korea must love the Black Swan... I praised Jimin and Jungkook in their solo dance at the MMA's and BTS for their Black Swan song. I'm a lover of the Black Swan for decades. I also praised this drama for the same dance.

Song Kang who played Lee Chae Rok was extremely amazing with all of the talents he showed in his acting skills. OMG, I love ballet and he seemed like has a niche for dancing. I am very shocked with his 6 months of training only. I loved it. He played this part very well and I am very pleased as a lyrical and street dancer. For being 27 wows, I need to see more dramas with him in it. The only thing I was embarrassed about is that a ballet costume is to cover what it needs to cover on a man but I felt bad for Song Kang because it revealed more than a real ballet costume would.

Na Moon Hee who played Choie Hae Nam the wife of Shim Deok Chul was awesome. I credit her acting in being and accepting Alzheimer's. I became very emotional with this actress.

We need more movies like this. My mother had pre-dementia starting at the age of 78 where she forgot all of her past but she didn't forget her children. She lived to be 95.

Made with a deft hand on all levels
There are so many things that can go wrong in a drama with a heart-tugging story, especially when it brings in an overworked trope to add to the pathos. But the writing never got sappy. Nothing was played for cheap thrills. The acting was spot-on, never descending into over-played or over-done pathos. In all the many ways this could have failed, it never did.
Park In-hwan is a master actor and always worth watching. His face is amazingly expressive and he provided a memorable character that you would love to meet. This was an Oscar-worthy performance.
Song Kang was gorgeous to watch in motion. It's hard to believe that he hadn't studied ballet all his life, but I suspect some of the magic in all the dance sequences is owed to brilliant editing. He played a wide range of emotions - exactly what you would expect from a young man grappling with family tragedy and finding his feet in the world. (No, I wasn't being cute with ""feet""!)
The entire cast was first rate, and you will love all of them.
If you have a dream, go out now and start to realize it. You may need to look for a parallel track, like the eldest son, or figure out what really matters, like the youngest son. I was over 50 when I took my first calculus class. You can do whatever you want to! Start now!

It's never too late
The way this drama conveyed such a meaningful story in such short amount of episodes amazes me. I wasn't expecting for this story to hit too close to home because ballet isn't one of my favorite things to be honest, but as you keep watching you get to understand that ballet is only the first layer, and that the stories of the characters go beyond that.

The dynamic between Chae Rok and Deok Chul is fantastic from the beginning. They truly complement each other so well and I love how Deok Chul helps Chae Rok to leave his comfort zone and explore the world. They form such a lovely relationship, almost like father and son. And I really love how, at the end, Chae Rok is truly invested in making Deok Chul perform in front of a whole audince like if it was his own dream. They learnt so much from each other, so much values and feelings. They got me crying in every episode. They really reminded me of the days I'd spent with my grandparents, it made me so happy.

Heo Bom's storyline is the other thing that I really liked. His character changes so much throughout the 12 episodes. He ends up understanding his own feelings and forgiving himself and Chae Rok's father in a certain way. When he showed up at the end in the theater, uffff I was crying so hard, I was so proud of him.

Though romance is rarely touched in this drama, I found it really cute when they showed interactions between Chae Rok and Eun Ho. It made me so happy when Chae Rok encouraged her to persue happines and find her true passion.

I think every character in the story has a good development and arc, I'm truly happy with the cast the chose and each storyline.

Please watch it
It's a short drama series that you must see. I loved every moment of the series. I think the cast was perfect and to be honest I haven't really paid attention to Song Kang that much in his previous works that I've watched. But after seeing this, I must say that during this drama, I grew to love him. He is such a versatile and good actor,. I was mesmerized by him throughout the episodes. I kept wondering if he actually had done ballet before, afterwards I heard he took ballet lessons for six months(?) for just this and I'm blown away. He definitely got a new fan. I think the other cast is well picked too and I loved how well everyone played their role. The roles were easily approachable.

As a fellow dancer myself I felt like this touched a lot of aspects of my own life and where I want to be in the future. It really made me think about life and life choices a lot which I think is a good thing. You know kind of like ""living without regrets"" or regretting something you didn't get to do. And you don't have to be a dancer to understand or get into this drama or feel the emotions or anything, no. But I think if you do dance, or it is a huge part of your life, this might touch you more and you might be more identified with the thoughts and emotions.

I also loved how different this was from the ""usual"" korean dramas. This is based on webtoon yes and not every korean drama is the same yes. But they often might have similar storyline etc. But this was a nice change in between the other dramas.

LOVED IT. PLEASE WATCH IT. IT'S A MASTERPIECE.

A unique story filled with warmth
This drama was a pleasant surprise pertaining to age and fulfilling your dreams with no regrets. It was very wholesome to see a 70 year old man pursue his dream of becoming a ballet dancer when his health and family seemingly stand in the way. We also meet a talented young man who is gifted in ballet but has his own struggles to overcome. Once they meet they form a reverse teacher-student bond that eventually leads to a grandpa-grandson bond and that is nice to watch.
I'm really impressed with how diverse Song Kang's recent roles have been. As an actor it's not good to box yourself in and allow yourself to be typecast. He has good looks but he isn't always going to be playing the hot guy and that's good for him. Back to him in this drama tho. I was really impressed when I learned that he trained in ballet for 6 months and was taught body lines for this role. It makes me happy to see when actors go the extra mile to present their character in the most authentic way possible. Knowing this gave me a bigger respect for him.
The actor who played Deok-chul was equally as impressive. Ngl the whole old-man-wanting-to-do-ballet thing was kind of funny and some scenes were funny but I commend this show for committing to the bit, even if it is based off of a webtoon.
As for the ending I feel like it should have ended sad but this drama was supposed to be a light-hearted inspirational type show so I can see why things went the way they did. Since Deok-chul got Alzheimer's, I imagined he would slowly forget everything, eventually leading to forgetting about his passion for dance and his mentor/son Chaerok. I really thought he was going to end up forgetting Chaerok but I'm kinda glad that didn't happen. Even if things would be more realistic.
Deok-chul had the courage to live his dream and perform Swan Lake and complete his lifelong dream before he passes and that is wholesome in itself. Didn't care for the side story with Chaerok's school bully thing. That guy was just despicable, and after injuring Chaerok to the point of jeopardizing his dance career, he was unforgivable in my eyes. Even if he did ""change"" in the end, that was just frustrating to me. Overall good show. 7/10

Dive into the Unknown
Oh what a mesmerizing emotional ride for the entire ten episodes! The perspicacious storyline, the role played by each cast with such éclat, the refractory emotions drawn out of every scenes and every dialogues macerated my heart, my mind, my soul and my existence with intense ineffable joy and sorrow both at the same time.

Navillera portraying a dirge vibe with its tone, filter and mood, have shaken my whole being with overwhelming emotions. Each and every episode made me cry out bucket of tears. The message of the story has been enunciated through suave sadness. Let me point out the diaphanous depiction of the story one by one which actually resulted into such level of admiration from numerous viewers.

The inevitable and uncontrolled curse of old age, yes that can be changed possessing gargantuan enthusiasm. Looking at life beyond what it is. Celebrating it amidst the flak, malignancy, wretched society, weltering failure, rising and shining again through fiasco is called life; living a wholesome life, living a deserving life. A simple message it contained. Splice up life in all adversities, in all maelstrom it throws and rise and shine again. Life is ephemeral not a single living being denies it yet irrespective of age, situation or whatever the condition a person is facing without debilitating, one must move forward.

The talented, crotchety young ballad student who was living diligently in this harsh competitive society and a 70-year old pertinacious man who was gradually turning senile, both of them come in contact for their greater passion for ballad. Both of them were adamant in their own stand; having extreme grit the first wanted to win renowned national and international competition and the latter wanted to soar at least once in his lifetime. So much of wholesome and platonic love developed between these two. Nearly five decades apart their age were, however, their camaraderie made everyone inebriated of various emotions for sure.

Many issues were depicted via this heartwarming story. The struggles of young people to live a decent life in this robust technological, globalized and competitive era. The struggles of old people who simply have no clue what to do with their life instead waiting for their life to end. The struggle of a person who wants to fulfill their dreams, their hurdles are seemingly endless. When a child, family restricts prospering a dream tagging a taboo, at young age too swayed with the hardships of life, at middle age too inclined in making a living for sustenance for his own family when at an old age the shame of getting revealed to the society or his own children. Shame is to die without trying, shame is to not venturing into one’s dream obtusely, shame is to not being able to satisfy one’s agog.

The portrayal of the story fused between mettlesome and pensive. Mettlesome in the sense that it forces one to hold onto that little straw called hope in one’s life and dive into the unknown without caring a single ounce about readiness with a fiery spirit; pensive in the sense to reflect at least once how to lead a more productive more fulfilling life till the end of our time.

Through terminal illness, through daunting young age, through superficial societal norms, through malicious judgment, through irreversible failure, through harsh rejection, through unbearable dejection – soar at least once. This one life given to us, make it quintessential.

All the casts were pure resplendence to enjoy. Haven’t seen such perfect cast so far. Each role was played meticulously by all the super talented individuals of all ages. I want each of them to soar like an eagle elegantly in their career for many more years to come. They all stole my heart especially one of our cutest duo – Chae Roki and harabuji. Haimoni was also the cutest.

""As you get older, you get used to goodbyes""
It was the first impactful quote for me. Although it doesn't fully represent the direction of the story, it makes a very important point. Time is precious.

Navillera is the inspirational slow-burn, slice of life you're probably (hopefully) looking for. I'm pretty sure I cried in every single episode, whether it was a few tears or full-on sobbing. Deokchul pursues the dream he lost as a child, wanting to finally fulfill it and keep his heart at ease. For him, ballet was his happiness. If there's anything he hasn't said goodbye to at an age of 70, it's ballet.

His story touched my heart and changed my way of looking at things. One--don't take things for granted. Two--it's never too late to do something.

Kudos to the cast, especially Song Kang who played as Chaerok here, a talented but stubborn ballerino who still has yet to make his debut. I first watched him in Sweet Home and seeing him here in a completely different role, I'm very impressed by his acting. And the fact that he practiced ballet for 6 months prior to filming amazes me.

Sure, the story is a bit predictable and you get a sense of where things are heading pretty fast. But that doesn't take away from the beautiful storyline and message--not to mention the really gorgeous cinematography and production. OSTS were on-point too.

What makes you happy? People figure it out at different times, but the drama reminds you that it's okay. If you're using that time to do something that brings you happiness, don't let go of it.

Simple but beautiful
I think this genuinely may have been the most beautiful K-Drama I've ever seen and I've seen many. I don't really know how to explain this drama because the only words that really come to mind are simply beautiful. It's a show that breaks your heart when you realize its time to say goodbye to the characters but it was also the perfect length. No episode was a filler episode. Every episode built on the previous one without repetition or overplaying clichés. No character was perfect, each had very realistic flaws but you still found yourself coming to understand and appreciate every character. There was growth in every character but it was realistic growth. While the show is focused on the two male leads we are able to see each side characters story being told without it overshadowing the main plot but instead complementing it.

This is by no means an exciting or action-packed drama. It is simply a drama highlighting two men with a wide age gap trying to achieve their dreams and dealing with life along the way. If you are looking for a romance drama, this is certainly not for you. This show focuses on the struggle but also strength that comes from bonds formed over time and through hard work. Love is not glorified in this drama but instead respected. There is no perfect relationship within this drama but somehow that just made this drama that much easier to connect with and become invested in. This is a drama that highlights the fact that there truly is no ""happy ending"" in real life. We can only hope to collect a few precious moments that we will be able to look back upon and smile. Growth also comes with pain and loss in this drama and when the show ends you are unsure if you should curl up and cry or be proud.

Looking back all of the characters in this show are quite dull and boring. They aren't your typical K-drama characters. There is really nothing special about any one of them. They are all painfully human. Somehow this show full of common people touches your heart in a way that most shows only dream of. I can not recommend this show enough.

A breath of fresh air
This drama was great, I'd reccomend it to anyone that's looking for a drama that's not a comedy/action/nor romance focused. I was looking for it, and this drama is that. It's wonderfully made and the acting is impeccable. Though, I gave the acting a 9.5 instead of 10 because in some scenes, the Characters were a little too cold to one another. I understand why, they need to focus on ballet but at some points they were unnecessarily cold to each other. The music is 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾😌. I mean, who doesn't love classical music? The relationships in this drama are amazing. There's no overdose of romance and I love that about it. Also, the character development??? 10/10 That one character's development (iykyk) was such a breath of fresh air, I grew to love his character so much at the end. All in all, I'd reccomend, it's a very heartwarming drama and I'm very glad I decided to watch it. It definitely deserves all the hype it's getting.

good heartwarming concept but tad slow
A good drama with an inspiring concept, but at times I felt it was slow and dragging. Definitely a one time watch, but not sure about rewatching. But if you are into normal slice of life dramas without any twists or actions or dramatic, but you just want something normal, then this is for you.

though I said it is slow-paced, this drama doesn't bore you. and the old man is highly adorable.

Emotional and character relationship driven.
You WILL cry. Lovely story, great acting, touching character relationships, and some great dance.

You get to see complex relationships between family and found family play out with great acting. I loved how all the characters were handled realistically and respectfully.

The two main leads really carry the emotional weight of the story and their relationship is one of the best I've ever encountered. But the other characters are just as great. Two of my faves especially were the grandmother and the angry blond.

This story will stay with me for awhile.

follow your heart and do what you love.
(This is my first ever review, I know its going to be all over the place, sorry for that!)
I started watching mainly because of my pure love for ballet even thought I am not a ballerina. I had a very high expectation for this show and it certainly satisfied me. Each role had a story which I enjoyed seeing very much
Secondly, I thought it'll be nice to see a BALLERINO instead of the usual BALLERINA I've seen a lot.
This show was very heart-warming, wholesome and relatable at some point. The message of 'it's never too late to find what you love' stayed with me through out the show and I hope the same will happen to you! I wish to write longer but I'm afraid I would not explain it well (:

Heartwarming masterpiece!
Navillera is a drama that really makes you feel that it’s never too late to live out your dreams. It was emotional but at the same time so refreshing to watch, Deokchul and Chaerok’s relationship was so endearing and the actors played their roles so well. I’m glad Song Kang took upon the role as it really highlighted his versatility in acting. One thing that really stood out to me was I didn’t really have many expectations before I first watched and didn’t really expect to like it, but I couldn’t have been so wrong, as the drama really warms your heart. One of the best slice-of-life dramas I’ve watched in the recent years, definitely recommend (but be prepared to cry!).

Love this drama right from the start
Excellent acting by all, great story line. Special praise for Park In Hwan who just makes this the most delightful story with his acting. You can feel yourself doing these things at his age. It is so motivational to see someone focused at an older age to achieve something new and so dramatically different from their regular lives. Comparing this to the naturally more self-centered youth is dealt with so well. Will update my review as I progress through the show but am in no hurry, just savouring each episode as they come.
This drama held its fascination for me right through to the end. Kudos to all involved for not losing steam but actually continuing to engage me even more. Thank you for this lovely experience.

This review may contain spoilers
You're never going to be perfectly ready....
This is such a beautifully-written drama. Each episode moves you in such a way, that I could not help watch it with misty eyes. I cried not particularly because of something sad or tragic that happened, but because of touching moments like the dancing scenes at the end of episode 8 (Chae-Rok dances in the park in front of Deok-Chool) and episode 10 (Deok Chool dances on the road in front of Chae-Rok).

Similar to Start-Up and Run On, this is a drama about chasing your dream. But this one includes an old man. You are never too old to make your dream come true, as long as you have the will to try. “When you want something with all your heart, you shine brighter than anyone else” (episode 11).

It shows a beautiful relationship between a 70-year-old senior citizen and a 23-year-old young man, each struggling to make their dreams happen. What started as a teacher/student relationship eventually turned out to be more like a father/son (or perhaps grandfather/grandson) relationship.

First of all, I really do admire senior actor Park Im-Hwan (who in real life is 75 years old!) who took the role as Deok-Chool. I read that he has been acting for more that 50 years, and yet he humbly admitted that he learned so much from this drama, pairing with the young Song Kang. The chemistry with Na Moon He (his wife, Hae-Nam, in the drama) was also great. I read that they have played as a couple too many times that they found it so much easy to connect with each other in Navillera. Having read that, now I remember that I’ve watched them both in Miss Granny.

Deok-Chool was such a fatherly figure whose purpose in life seemed to be encouraging people to chase their dream. Not once did you see him being mad at his children (the family dynamics were interesting). When the youngest son, Seong-Gwan, decided to become a film-maker, and left his job as a medical doctor, he said nothing. When his eldest son, Seong-San (who was not a pleasant person to begin with) did a huge mistake at work, Deok-Chool gave him baseball gloves and told him to pursue what makes him happy. He was so supportive to his granddaughter, Eun-Ho, who had just begun to build her professional career. He even gave encouraging words to Ho-Beom, the antagonist. Of course, you would find more heart-warming dialogues between fatherly Deok-Chool and Chae-rok throughout the drama.

One of the best quotes from this drama was when Grandpa Deok-Chool told Bo-Heom: “You’re never going to be perfectly ready. Start now and get better 0ver time. Diver right in, even if you don’t feel ready”. Yes, whatever it is, follow your dream. We may be terrified to begin, but we had better take the first step.

Now I also want to give two thumbs up to Song Kang who brilliantly and beautifully portrayed the life of the aspiring ballerino, Chae-Rok. In the early episodes, Chae-Rok did sometimes come out as a difficult character, using harsh words to his fellow workers at the restaurant. He was also rude and nasty to grandpa Deok-Chool at the beginning stages of teaching ballet. He rarely smiled at the beginning and yet you still liked him. Perhaps because there was this subtle sadness on his face, and then knowing he had a strained relationship with his own father, that made you love and sympathize Chae-Rok.

I liked the fact that Song Kang took his role seriously by taking ballet lessons for six months before acting in this drama. This is one thing that I admire about him. I also liked it when Song Kang perfectly pronounced French ballet terms, such as devant, passe, releve lent. I look forward with great anticipation to see more dramas/movies with Song Kang’s wonderful acting in it.

The father/son dynamic between Deok-Chool and Chae-Rok was beautifully portrayed by showing how it growed stronger and stronger in each episode. You can just see that they both needed each other. They were both benefiting each other, not just on ballet, but on life and pursuing dreams. They were also thankful for having found each other, ending with a very touching airport scene in the final episode.

This is my first Korean drama to watch in 2021, with no romance, love triangles, or jealousy. This was more about chasing your dreams, soaring high, and developing human bonds regardless of age differences. A highly recommended drama to watch.

Don't give up your dreams, it's never too late
One of the best dramas that came out this year! I never saw a drama so pure and beautiful than Navillera. The story captivates you since the beggining and looks like you are living with Deokchul. His background story is fascinating (and sad) and very inspiring.
Actually, the whole show is inspiring. After watching the first 4/6 episodes you will want to get up and start following your dreams.
The whole ideia it's give us the message that we can't live by fear and what the other people think about you.
Every single one of the family of Deokchul grown up.
The frienship with Cherok it's really different and beautiful. You can see how bouth help eachother.
The fotography, image and song it's a materpiece and THE BALLET really surprised me (in a good way).

Navillera it's a much watch k-drama!

Incredibly Great
This drama took me by surprise. I just decided to watch the first episode because I new that the last 2 episodes were going to be shown soon. I fell in love with the 2 main characters. It felt like a father and son coming together. Both the characters change so many other characters in the story. An even the topic is sad but, I love how the writer and the director put it together. To use ballet as the back up to the topic was simply genius. I have not seen ballet since I was in high school and I had forgotten how wonderful and joyful it makes you feel when you watch it. To see how the 2 main characters come together and the love and friendship that develops. The trust that they have between them. How a family come together when one needs it the most. I think I cry just because I was happy to be watching it. We are all getting old and as we age we learn from the lessons we have gone thru. To share what we know with the a younger person and help them realize their dream is wonderful. The ending of this story was perfect. I love it. The actors performance was wonderful. Some of the best I have seen. The scrip and direction is also the best. I even love the music and is not something I critic while I am watching. One to put on your list.

This was such a wholesome drama about how it's never too late to achieve your dreams. I was suggested to have a box of tissues close by when watching this and I would recommend you do as well because it will definitely be needed. I cried a few times and teared up a lot.

Mr. Sim and Chae Rok both inspired each other to move forward to achieve their dreams and they genuinely came to care for each other. Their relationship was such a wholesome growth from Chae Rok reluctantly teaching Mr. Sim to a familial bond between them as if they were really grandson and grandfather.

I don't regret watching this drama because it has been such a long time since I've seen a drama that wasn't centered around romance, mystery, or angst. It's so inspiring and I hope that more people will watch it because it really needs to be seen by so many people.

Impressive emotional Humanitarian drama
Not too soon for a raving review for this master piece
It's such an amazing story with a really good heart warming scenes
It has everything that any human being needs
The family bonds , the unifamilial relations yet as strong as family
everybody's dream of achieving something in their lives even with old age you can't stop dreaming and trying to achieve that dream
Love in it's purest meaning ,,, the love that we all long for
also the director's respect for the grandfather ,, letting him dance in proper clothing not tight cloths as any ballerina wear
the lighting ,, the far angles in each dance not to show dancers body to respect every taste who watch the drama
turning the bully into a decent human in such little actions
this drama has such great subtle messages that give you warmth and feeling of decency
I love it so much
I recommend it to anyone who want to watch something not romantic yet full of lovely feelings

Good but boring...
When I started watching Navillera, I was touched by the idea of an elderly man pursuing his childhood dream of learning ballet and that's why I decided to give this drama a chance, but I wouldn't re-watch it.
It 's heartwarming and inspirational, but I don't think that it's special.
Although I loved the acting and the story, I thought about dropping it many times.
This drama is so slow and boring I had to speed up the playback of each episode up to 1,5 times.
I mean, there are better dramas to spend time with.

Wholesome and Heartwarming
There aren't many slice of life, heartwarming dramas out lately. Navillera stirs warm emotions and does it well. You can't help but root for everyone in this show - even the supporting cast members and their side stories. I appreciate this show. It's a hidden gem. The actors do a wonderful job. Grandpa Sim's character is somewhat motivational. He makes everyone want to strive for the best and not settle for a satisfactory life. I feel great watching every episode of Navillera thus far. I am recommending this drama to everyone who asks.

Most heartwarming drama I’ve ever watched
I have never been the one to write reviews but this deserves a review. When I tell you this is the most heartwarming story, it makes my heart ache with happiness but also sadness. This drama goes through deep messages of life and accurately depicts family in various scenarios. I cried so much because of how relatable and down to reality it was. Because it depicted reality, I was also scared of how accurate it was. I loved the cast. There is nothing about it that I didn’t like except for that it ended. Definitely worth a watch as you will definitely get something out of it. You will not regret it!

Amazing
This show was by far one of the most touching and inspirational shows I have ever seen. Giving you everything you need in a few hour long sessions. They had sports, and yes dance of any kind is a sport. At least it is for those that are dancer, not for those that can dance. This story is a true testament that it is never too late to follow your dreams, but it will not be easy.

Lee on his own, has his own daemons to deal with but it never seemed to break him, however, his heart does get broken because of Sim. This well paced and well written relation development, touched my heart. Showing all you really need is one person to support you and you can achieve anything. No dream is impossible, and they both had dreams that they were fighting for. Sim's family honestly made me sad, for they (especially the eldest son) were so absorbed in their own image, that they didn't realise that they can only be held accountable for what they do. Also, no two person's happiness are brought by the same thing.

I was happy to see all the characters development that took place during the series. Telling the story of family, friends and strangers that become family, like no other. The last few episodes broke my heart when he got on that plan but the anxiety I felt was at peak when I studied how it may be if they returned but everything is forgotten. Lee and Sim had the best chemistry between them, setting the stage for their teacher student relationship to grow into something more like family.

These men acted their everything off, I believed every moment of their performances, not to mention Lee (Song Kang) is drop dead handsome, but I am so glad that he is an exceptional actor also. Everyone did an amazing job here and I was happy to be taken along for this emotional roller-coaster ride.

I meaaaan. This show made me realize I also have dreams of my own. I want to accomplish some things before I die. That’s how you know the acting and writing combined with everything is just that good. I’m on the second to last episode and like woooooowwwww. Kdrama never disappoints. Thanks fir filling most if my youth time ?

I would recommend this to anyone who is everyone. By the time you’re looking at reviews if this show like I was, that means it moved you too. Masterpiece. No disappointments here. Loads of love to that old man pursuing what he wants.

It's not the end until is the end!
Magnifico! as they would say in ballet. :)
I took my time with this one. It was very close to home so it made it hard. Zewa should award me customer fidelity and a box of tissues. It wasn't an easy watch, especially for someone that still has dreams but feels silly about them. We should never put age limits on dreams, right? But when reality checks hit you in the face day after day it's really hard. So, yeah...I'm someone that needed Navillera. I guess i am not done after all. :)
I should be reviewing the series. What is a review? A critical appraisal... I got nothing to criticize here. :)))
Don't watch something cause someone said so, and don't skip cause someone couldn't relate to it. Different strokes for different folks. What today didn't fit the bill, tomorrow might. I mean I am not sure how I'd see this if i were only 20-25 years old. I hope regardless of age people watch it and appreciate for what it is. A warning. :)) Time goes by with you or without you.

Navillera could be a bit maudlin at times, but life is like that! I can't believe I wasn't even planning to finish this. It's one of the most beautiful stories with such rich characters who each get a chance at redemption. Even the theme of following your heart wasn't trite. This didn't only apply to Deokchul, most precious man ever, but everyone he comes into contact with. He never got angry. He was always so kind, considerate, tender, and gentle, even when others didn't reciprocate. There was a lot of poetry in Navillera too. I love love love it forever.

What a heartwarming drama! I'd passed by this drama on Netflix many times but seeing the high reviews on MDL made me decide to give it a go. The cast did such a wonderful job in portraying their characters, especially Park In Hwan (the scenes in which he forgets who he is are so believable that I had to remind myself he was acting!). I do wish they had Chaerok work on his anger management though. Even though he does usually mean well, his attitude would totally be unacceptable in my eyes, especially towards someone so much older. Overall, I loved the development of the plot and the characters, and appreciated that the ending really tied everything together rather than leaving things feel like they were unfinished.

Absolutely beautiful masterpiece!
I didn't expect to love this drama as much as I did.
I started watching it mainly because of Song Kang and I thought the 할아버지 storyline would be just a cute k-drama theme about making your dreams come true regardless of age.
I didn't expect to cry so much.
I didn't expect to smile so much.
I didn't expect to reflect on my own life so much.

The acting was absolutely perfect, all of the characters were portrayed so naturally. And the relationship between 할아버지 and Chae-rok was really one of a kind.

I can't really say more without spoiling it, but I never wrote any k-drama review until now and the reason I had to do it with Navillera is simple- if you can't decide whether you should watch this or not- DEFINITELY WATCH IT! You won't regret it.. It's really more than it seems to be.. A hidden gem..

Very beautiful, but it would've worked better with a different format.
This drama was very beautiful in many ways. Not a lot of ""softer"" dramas are non-romantic, but this one managed to execute it wonderfully. It was super touching, to say the least. My only issue with the show that made me ""like it very much"" rather than love it, was the fact that it followed the drama-airing-on-television format. I actually started this in May and only managed to finish it in August because the first 4-or-so episodes were just so heavy and boring that it took me months to watch them. But from then on, it became very interesting and I watched the rest of the episodes very quickly. I can't critique this aspect too much, but the show was indeed aired on television and was made to do so, but if this show had the format of a ""super"" Netflix Original (the ones that don't air on TV at all like ""Move To Heaven"" compared to the ones that Netflix just acquire like ""Navillera"") I think the story would've been even more beautifully executed.

Heartwarming, wonderful tale
This was an absolutely beautiful story. I loved every minute of it and it has quickly become my favorite drama ever. There's so much to love- an elderly male lead, a focus on family relationships, genuine friendship between male characters, passion for nontraditional hobbies, etc etc. The story moves you and sticks with you. The characters are so compelling, you can't help but hope for the best outcome for all of them, even ones you wouldn't suspect. Prepare to feel so very deeply that you'll need to recover before watching anything else.

Excellent drama and must watch
Amazing drama.. Song Kang and Park In Hwan are wow. I don’t know how much effect they kept to do this amazing ballet but every thing paid off.
Direction, story, specially dialogues are awesome.
The way story takes turns and with so much emotion is really touching. Every special moment in this series will make you remember or relate your self to your life.
If you are planning to motivate your self or to give yourself a bit push but don’t know where to start. The dialogues in this drama will help you.
I loved Song Kang acting so much in this drama.. and Mr.Park will make you feel every inch in your life.
This series made me to cry. And made me to push myself a lot. I’m very much glad I watched it.
Thank you team for this amazing series. A true beautiful butterfly

The most heart warming K-drama I've ever watched!!! It's never too late to achieve your dreams :)
So this is my very first time to write a review
for a K-Drama and honestly I was hesitant to watch it at first because I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it, but I still
went ahead and watch it anyway. And guess what? It was the best decision I've ever made. I LOVE LOVE
LOOOOOVE this drama. Watching this drama was
quite an adventure, it made me smile, laugh, and most of the time bawl. Because this drama is full of
warmth, it's very light and family oriented as well. I
love the friendship of Harabeoji and Chae Rok, it's
very wholesome. It also made me realize that it's
never too late to make all your dreams come true,
you can still make them happen no matter how old or young you are. That's why I definitely recommend
this drama!!! It's actually 11/10 for me. That's how
much it touched my heart ❤❤❤

I was watching, and then I started crying
70 year old and a dream.

Deokchul is the cutest 70 year old man I've ever seen, so cheerful, even when everything seems hopeless.. He is the most accurate/ positive elder representation I've seen in a drama so far. so passionate and thoughtful, yet it shows how he hasn't always been this optimistic, and it's decades of working hard and pushing his own personal dreams to the side in order to satisfy everyone's expectations.

as a fellow artist with many dreams that seem so far out of my reach, this drama hit deep in my core.
if you're like me, like Deokchul, like those who work at a job they don't like but can't drop because money controls what they can or can't do, like students who are not sure they're going down the right path but they are unfortunately not granted second chances, like the kids that feel like they owe success to their parents, etc...

if you need to feel like you've been heard ; this one is gonna hurt but it's gonna feel so right.

side note : I'm so glad we finally get to see Song Kang in a role that truly embraces his potential as an actor. His character is hardworking and stubborn, and I don't expect any less from a ballet dancer.

The cutest 'odd couple', and also a lovely slice of life
A good show makes it easy to suspend all disbelief. The dancing was mostly cringey and underwhelming, but I didn't care one bit because I was so invested in the characters. I lost count of how many times that old man choked me up. The young male lead didn't have as much to do, but he was well cast and very appealing. Good chemistry.

I had only a couple of difficulties with this.

(1) In early episodes, the dynamics between the old man, his wife, and eldest son were difficult to understand. Small-mindedness and arrogance were given as superficial explanations for the extreme behavior initially. The deeper issues seemed to involve a cultural specificity that I couldn't grasp entirely. Later on, the wife's and son's transformations felt rather sudden and not entirely credible.

(2) The show's pacing was mostly excellent, but some of the later episodes felt so, so draggy. Nothing much was happening and there were too many montages, testing my patience severely. The story was predictable, but that was OK. I was glad the writers didn't distract from the main story by adding unnecessary romance.

Overall, I'd recommend this highly.

At least once in my life, I want to soar.
This was a very touching story between 2 polar opposites who share the same love for ballet. It portrayed one's pursuit of dreams, importance of family, and accepting the process of aging. I was really looking forward to this drama because 1) the plot seemed promising, and 2) of course, Song Kang but sadly, I couldn't fully soak in all the emotions it was trying to relay because of some minor details (which I found distracting).

This was a great story, but the storytelling was not perfect. There were events which simply do not make sense. Some events sequence sometimes felt unnatural, too many coincidences, some conversation dialogues felt awkward, and the cuts for flashbacks felt misplaced. I think there could have been more depth to the characters, especially Deok-Chul's children, who somehow seemed like they were strangers. Chae-Rok felt ""unstable"". because as the story progresses, I noticed how he interchanges between being nice and mean towards Deok-Chul.

Despite all these, I do not regret watching this drama. It was a good drama, but it could have been better. These details did not significantly impact the message of this drama, which is to reach for you dreams, seek for what it is that truly makes you happy.

Watch This! You Won't Regret It!
What a wonderful drama about an older gentleman finding the courage to fulfill long lost dreams and a young man who helps him achieve them!

I have been watching several dramas with Song Kang because his talent and good looks has struck me in a good way. The camera loves him. The first time I saw him in Sweet Home, I knew he was someone to look out for. He has such a striking look on screen and he brings an earnestness to all of his roles. I am looking forward to watching him in many more dramas.

And what can I say about Park In Hwan? He was perfect in his role of the older man looking to fulfill the dreams he put to sleep for a more practical career. The relationship between these two main leads was endearing. You care about them deeply and he plays the loving grandfather to perfection. This is a beautiful production with a solid and talented cast. Every character goes through a journey of self discovery and Park In Hwan is the glue that holds them all together. Bravo!

Hands down the best Korean drama I've ever seen.
I cried every episode and it got me so excited.
I loved all the characters, their growth and their relationships. I highly recommend it because it deals with very beautiful and profound themes, and in a sobering way. I will definitely see him again.

WHOLESOME, HEARTWARMING
If you are looking for chill, wholesome story, this is the drama you should watch. Story about an old man wishing he started doing ballet sooner and pursuing his passion is heartwarming. Even though on some parts it's not as chill, the dramatic atmosphere makes you question your personal thoughts. I sometimes felt like old Deokchul did, like I have some regrets and I started improving myself a little. The positive impact Deokchul had on Chaerok, his ballet teacher, was amazing and brought a great character development in Chaerok. Although I cried a river most of the time, it was a pleasant experience, this drama. I found out about it from Shinee TAEMIN because he sings the main theme song. After watching I felt different, fulfilled in some type of way. Song Kang is one of my favourite actors and he killed this role, he dedicated so much of his time practicing ballet that it felt so real, like he did it all his life. Not going to lie,I fell hard for him. Also when Deokchul started doing ballet, the positive change it brought to his whole family really made me think that there can be change in this world, that you shouldn't follow strict rules because you'll end up miserable. This drama is realistic, even though at some point the story was quite slow paced, I continued watching. The scenes aren't overreacted, they are as I said realistic. Warning, if you have even a little bit of heart, prepare for tears.

Warm and beautiful...
You're looking for a love story? Then this is it. No bed scenes or kisses, just romantic towards life.
After watching this I felt so many emotions. Happiness, sadness, even fear, but the biggest one was relief.
I'm a teenager and most of the times it's difficult to think about being older when I feel like I'm not even done enjoying my childhood. College, work, family... everything seems so far away from my capabilities, and everyone keeps pushing me to that. However, this drama made me feel welcomed, like someone was finally telling me ""it's not too late"" or ""don't be affraid"".
I never dream too high, but after finishing that last episode I felt capable and validated for the first time. Like it was okay to not forget about your dreams.
Tbh, I wanted to be more critical, but it's impossible for me lol. All I can say is: Here you have a great drama, make a little bit of time for yourself and watch it, you won't regret one single minute.

- I'm a Spanish speaker, sorry if I made too many mistakes.

An Atypical Korean Drama for an Atypical Main Character
I normally have a review template I use when reviewing dramas/movies but I can't review this drama with that standard because this drama goes beyond just a review and ratings.

I actually didn't intend to watch this drama at all because it didn't really seem all that appealing to me. Admittedly, I thought it would be a really slow-paced, boring drama because it was about older people. Yes, I stereotyped a drama and judged it off the cuff. I've never been so glad to be more wrong in my life and be humbled because of my ignorance.

This is a slice-of-life drama and is a story of an older man's long life desire to learn how to do ballet. We follow a man as he experiences the particular hardships one only endures in old age. Burdened by the opinions of others and trapped in the solidarity of family roles, Mr. Shim is inspired to become good at something he's always wanted to do his entire life before regret caught up to him.

Ballet.

I do have to point out though that Mr.Shim's dream ISN'T to become a ballet dancer. His dream is to LEARN how to do ballet. I originally thought he wanted to become a ballet dancer at first but as I kept watching the drama, it became more apparent to me that he was most happy learning to do something he really loved. Mr. Shim even says his expectations were never about becoming a dancer who could perform on stage (though I'm sure he still dreamt for it) but to be an accomplished ballet student in his own right for his own gratification and not for the adoration from others. The events that followed afterwards are only a product of his own efforts. He never once asked for more than to learn. Others around him are the ones that offered.

A 70-year old grandfather wants to learn how to do ballet.

I knew that this was going to tug a few heartstrings when I first started watching it but only a couple of episodes in it, I was already quite tearful as I stared at the face of a dejected man who thinks it's too late to live.

This grandfather meets a blunt and frank young man who has been in ballet training for years whose dream is to turn it into a career. This young man is closed-off, dismissive, and unapologetically candid but is someone who also grapples with his own life struggles to accomplish his dreams. The two make an unlikely pair as the young man is forced to teach ballet to an elderly grandfather but as they spend more time together, a grandfather's shameless warmth helps bring a young man out of the darkness he's found himself in and begins to see a different way of looking at things through the wise and understanding eyes of aged maturity. Together, they teach each other to see what the other cannot and form a beautiful and strong friendship.

This drama will open your eyes and help you realize that this the path we will all travel down eventually and that our lives mean more than our age, physical appearance or health. Watching this drama won't only help you to appreciate the elderly but to also open up conversations with ourselves. What regrets do we have right now? Are we holding ourselves back because of fear? What are we afraid of? Do you know what your parents dreams are? What are your own dreams?

This drama gives us a glimpse into what our own lives might be like if we dare to continue to soar, even if our wings are withered and weak. Even if we've already accomplished a lot in our youth. People always ask ""What are your dreams?"" and for some reason, everyone thinks we are only supposed to have one dream when we were asked the plural 'dreams'.

Sure your life may get a little boring and mundane as you get older and your body gets slower but your birth never came with an expiration date until it happens. So live your life unapologetically and consideration.

Your life is not over because you got old, it's only over if you give up.

SIDETALK: Mr. Shim is an absolute gem of a character and Park In Hwan did an AMAZING FANTASTIC job portraying him. He showed his warm loveable and adorable side and his poignant yet undefeated confidence so perfectly! There were so many times I wanted to just give this grandpa a big hug when he was sad and be his biggest cheerleader when he accomplished something, no matter how small it was. This drama will be one to put in my TOPS list!

Good Enough
Korean Drama ""Navillera"" is a bittersweet story about an unusual friendship.

The drama starts slowly, with a simple plot prompt: an elder wants to learn how to dance ballet, the ballerino who is forced to teach him doesn't really want to. From then the drama builds up the melodrama element, adding family drama here and there, a few twists, and then finally it let things come together and creates a puzzle of a heartbreaking story and a strong, warm friendship.

What, however, makes the drama even more special are the performances and the dancing scenes that were perfectly executed. The atmosphere was nicely created with the settings and a suitable soundtrack that was simple, melodic and in the background, creating a more intense drama. The pace was perfect as well and, fortunately, the drama didn't overdo it with the length and it ended when it was needed.


So, overall, nine out of ten.

Beautiful drama about life, family and friendship.
When I first saw the trailer for Navillera, I figured I should just wait until it was done so I could binge it-- after all, what drew me in to it was that Song Kang was one of the main leads and I wanted to enjoy it without having to wait.

And then the first episode came out.

The story and the charcters pulled me in immediately, and I knew there was no way I was going to be able to do anything but wait for Monday and Tuesday every week so I could watch the new episodes the day they aired. Apart from Deok Chul's illness, which is still heavily foreshadowed, there aren't many twists or plots you can't see coming, but that does very little to affect the overall enjoyment of this drama. You know what's going to happen, but you develolp such a bond with these characters through the course of the episodes that you can't help but be on the edge of your seat wishing for them to succeed, to find their happiness, and to accomplish their dreams. And thankfully, they all do-- but that does not take away from its realistic ending.

Deok Chul is a person with Alzheimer's, and he knows, his family knows, and we know that it will only get worse, and it does-- and it breaks your heart. Not only for him-- who, by the way, will become your grandpa and you will love him with all your heart if you watch-- but for all the people who have to deal with this unforgiving illness in the real world.

This drama leaves you feeling like things will be okay, and even though you might feel like your time to do something you love has passed, it's never too late to follow your dreams in any way you can.

“It’s Never too late for trying something you love” This is the highlight.
I don’t usually write many reviews but this is such a masterpiece that I must. This is the second Song Kang drama that I’m writing a review cause he just doesn’t ever fail to impress me.

Honestly, after the disappointing Love Alarm 2.0 I just wanted to support Song Kang in general which is why I decided to watch this. I had no intention of watching it cause it was totally opposite of what I normally watch. I thought the plot was boring but had to watch it for Song Kang.
Although I had very little expectations, the first episode itself was so beautiful and captivating. I’m so glad that I decided to watch it cause it’s so inspiring. The plot seemed so complete after watching the first episode.

Acting/Cast: The cast was so perfect. No one could’ve acted better than the actors who are acting. The way they all pulled of their role SO WELL is no joke- I am so impressed by song kang after this cause his acting skills are no joke. He is definitely gonna go a long way. The actor is harabeoji, he was so perfect. The way he portrayed his role SO WELL is insane. The teaching teaching Chae rok and ho beom were so amazing.

Side story: Apart from the ML’s story, Ho beom’s story caught my attention so well. I felt his pain through his acting and I felt why he rebelled. His character and acting were so heart touching, I low-key fell for him lol.

Overall: I was highly impressed and inspired. So glad I watched it.

Blah-villera
I see this drama is described as heart-warming so sorry not sorry that my cold heart made me drop this boring tripe.

The premise is something that could be wrapped up in a 2 hrs long movie yet somehow they decided to stretch it into 12 episode drama and they already ran out of gas in episode 3. This is basically a drama that builds to only 2 things: whether the hot pouty ballerino is going to win the National competition (the sensible story), and whether the 70 years old man with no prior dance experience is somehow going to perform ballet on the stage (the nonsense story). The rest is no1curr filler about the grandpa's good-4-nothing children, romance between the hot ballerino and grandpa's granddaughter plus her employment woes, ballerino's part time job woes, ballerino's convoluted rivalry with some blond soccer punk, ballerino's strained relationship with his jailbird father who has something to do with blond punk's grudge. None of this has anything to do with ballet.

Grandpa actor is the highlight but his character quickly goes from endearing to delulu and annoying for he apparently really think that he could and should perform on the stage like a pro. Song Kang aka the hot pouty ballerino pouts a lot and it's really ridiculous how obvious it is that he isn't performing even the most basic ballet. The switch between his sweaty head-to-shoulders closeup and ""headless"" dancing by the real ballet dancer was hilarious at first but irritating the longer the drama went. It really takes you out of the experience. I liked Song Kang in Sweet Home where his catatonic pouty acting style worked perfectly. Not so much here or in the boring Love Alarm. No one else registers cause they are all in the skippable filler described above and responsible why it's so skippable.

I watched first 3 episodes in full and the next 3 with a lot of skipping. Now I have dropped it for good which sucks because I like ballet, Black Swan is one of my all time favorite movies, and I greatly enjoyed even the trashy Tiny Pretty Things series. But this is a dumb premise that doesn't have much to do with ballet and the level of boredom makes it recommendable only to insomniacs.

The importance of dreams and passion
Since no one is going to write a review, I will.

This is my first review so bear with me. Since I've watched Sweet Home, I've been waiting for another Korean Drama from Song Kang and was so excited when I heard that he will be in Navillera. I was very excited to watch the first episode of Navillera when it came out and I got to say, IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. At least not yet.

I am not going to write a huge essay like others but the ballet performance by Song Kang was AMAZING. I was very surprised when I saw it because I didn't have many expectations since he isn't a ballet dancer but I was wrong. I don't know anything about ballet but his skill seems good for someone who only practiced for 6 months. Navillera reminds me of Angel's Last Mission: Love in terms of ballet. Angels' Last Mission was one of my favorite Korean Dramas EVER, so it is understandable that I also like Navillera.

I seriously like the plot. I always wanted to watch a Korean Drama about how it is never too late to pursue your dreams. Song Kang is a plus to this drama, at least for me, it feels like buy 1-get-1 free, watch a good Korean drama + a good actor. I haven't talked about it but Park In Hwan also slayed it. I loved his character and how he displayed emotions on screen. I really hope that there is no romance just because it might intervene the heartwarming plot and steal it from its title. I won't spoil anything about the story so go watch it on your own, I promise, it is going to be worth it.

The only thing that I didn't like that much was the OST. There was a very emotional scene where Chae Rok calls his dad but it was ruined by the OST. Honestly, there isn't much to say since I only watched 2 episodes but I hope that the OSTs get better. After all, OST is one of the best things about Korean Dramas.

All in all, this is a healing Korean Drama with a heartwarming plot so get ready for the emotional rollercoaster. If you like healing Korean Dramas, then this is for you.

Average K-Drama with predictable plot
I was so happy to see Song Kang play in another drama after LA2,because that one was a tragedy.
He was the only reason why I started watching this drama in first place. After watching couple of episodes, I lost my interest completely.

The story was intriguing at first, and then it became boring. Way too predictable, we have the typical k-drama story which has been already done before, and we are basically walking in circles.

You can wait and see if the old man(which is basically the highlight of this show, but sometimes is annoying) with no prior experience will end up living his dream, watching the young ballet dancer losing his hope and spark for ballet and dealing with family problems, and then finally understand that he needs to do it just to prove himself that he was born to do this, and then fall in love with the old guy's granddaughter while she struggles to find a job while she's coming from a rich family.
It's blah-blah-blah. You need to watch only the first few episodes and you can guess how it's going to end.

Some might find it amazing, incredible and inspiring, but at the same time it's boring, long, nothing exciting and a plot we've seen many times before, just modernized a bit.
I was really hoping that I'll enjoy another good drama with him, but this was a little disappointing.

Extraordinary tale of ordinary people!
I just can't express my feelings. I knew I would love it. Not just loved it, I literally consumed the first episode.

The opening scene scored on my heart. The Ballet performance was just breathtaking, for a non-dancer, he nailed every moment. You know Ballet needs momentum after fast movements, you must end each step and gesture in a slow motion and smoothly. And I specially paid attention to that and he hit all the moments rights. true hard work spoke there.

Regarding the plot, without revealing much, it is pretty much what is said in the synopsis of this page. The rawness this series holds, has a unique attraction to its audience. It can be your typical Korean drama, where usual tragic life, bitter and hurt Lee Chae Rok, trying his best to fight against all odds, and it can be very unique drama where hopes and dreams are born every minute. The Haraabuji, family is as toxic as the Chae Rok life is, the writer wrote the characters, keeping their connection alike while making their age gap 50 years apart.

This is very clear, that the Chae Rok is a reflection of Haraabuji and Harabuji past live is Chae Rok I love how they are mirror to each-other. I was captivated from the first scene to last, even though nothing much happened, but for a drama like this, it is perfect, like no mistake at all.

The friendship that is going to develop between them is going to heal their wounds, is going to make them achieve their dreams. Chae Rok is going to grow and will learn to how to dance on life. The gift that Haraabuji is going to give him, is larger than life. I just can't wait to see the rest fo drama.

It gives me the vibe of Do You Like Brahms, and also feels very similar to Light In Your Eyes and Goodbye My Friends. I watched this series with puppy eyes, in coming episodes, we are going to cry as people will try their best to crush their dreams, but one thing is for sure, Haraabuji is a gift for Chae Rok, he will know when time is gonna come.

A must watch series for the healing of your heart.
