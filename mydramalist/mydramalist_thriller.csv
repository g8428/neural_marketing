Strong Start, Weak Finish
Contrary to the popular opinion here, I really appreciated the extensive backstories of the characters. It effectively provided justifications for why the participants would engage in such an insane project, which is quite rare for the typical Death Game film (usually, the participants are lazily thrown into their circumstances due to some metaphysical element within the story or deus ex machina reasoning). I also enjoyed the softer social commentaries in the beginning of the film and the fairly realistic and reasonable depictions of the main characters. That is, none of the characters are overly virtuous or exceptionally talented, and they all act or respond appropriately to the situation at hand; I can see these characters in my day-to-day life. Finally, the cinematography and acting (of the main characters) were masterfully executed.
Where the series started to go seriously wrong was in the final few episodes when the filmmakers decided to use caricatures for their characters as if they were holding a contest to use as many tropes as possible to fit the bill of the caricature in question; at some point, I was not sure whether the series abruptly became a satire. Not only were these caricatures agonizing to watch, but the decisive shift in narrative presentation really killed the immersive experience evoked by the previous episodes. Additionally, the moral justifications for why the mastermind started the entire project were very banal, forced, and unconvincing; the creativity of the ""midnight bet,"" from which he grounds his perspective, is what you would expect from a #SocialExperiment Youtube video, not a Netflix produced K-drama.
All in all, for someone who does not enjoy the typical Death game flick, I found the series very entertaining and well made within the category, but beyond this, it is forgettable. Although the cast, cinematography and music scores were appropriate and exceptional, there was, unfortunately, nothing noteworthy about the screenplay and directing.

Winner Takes All
Squid game is a South Korean children’s playground game that was popular back in the 1980s. It is similar to hopscotch but with a more expansive playing area and team-based approach. It forms the basis of the game setting that is featured in Squid Game.

Production Details

The drama is written and directed by the award-winning Hwang Dong Hyuk, known for critically acclaimed films The Fortress and Silenced. Jung Jae Il, who is known for composing the score for Okja and Parasite, serves as the music director. Produced by Siren Pictures exclusively for Netflix, this is a pre-produced drama with all 9 episodes released worldwide on 17 September 2021. It is given an R-18 rating and contains sexual references, nudity, and violence. Strobing effects present in certain episodes (especially episode 4) may cause discomfort for photosensitive viewers. Other trigger warnings include scenes of violent deaths, as well as gratuitous blood and gore.

Premise and Plot

456 participants competing in a “Hunger Games meets Battle Royale” series of challenges modelled after traditional South Korean children’s playground games for a chance of winning the jackpot of 40 million won, rising up to 45.6 million won with the elimination of all other participants right to the last person standing.As for who the organisers are and the reason for the competition, all shall be revealed as the story unfolds..

The story revolves around the points of view of a number of characters who share one thing in common - they are in serious need of cold hard cash to resolve their respective predicaments. Central to the core narrative is the main character and protagonist, Seong Gi Hoon, a gambling addict down on his luck who is facing debt problems and child-custody issues, as well as dealing with his mother’s deteriorating health.

What I Liked

As expected of a Netflix original series, I enjoyed the production quality and values, unique set designs and costumes, exceptional cinematography especially during some of the stunning choreographed action sequences and the game or challenge settings.

The cast is outstanding, comprising veterans in Lee Jung Jae, Park Hae Soo, Heo Sung Tae, Kim Joo Ryung and Oh Young Soo, among others. The newcomer Jung Ho Yeon gives a decent debut performance complete with the North Korean accent. I was pleasantly surprised to see brief appearances by Gong Yoo and Lee Byung Hun. Even with limited screen time, their charisma absolutely shines through to light up the production.

The edge-of-the seat thrills and suspense plays out in a riveting pace. This drama is well worth the binge because it is as captivating as it is addictive to consume in a single seating. Moments of extreme tension are aplenty along with the heart-wrenching emotions which are deftly interspersed amidst the high-octane action sequences throughout. I particularly enjoyed the epic final showdown between the finalists in the concluding arc of the drama.

The music score composed by Jung Jae Il is sublime, along with classic compositions used courtesy of the Budapest Scoring Orchestra and Big Band. They include The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss II, Trumpet Concerto in E Flat Major by Franz Joseph Haydn and Tchaikovsky’s Serenade for Strings. A cover of Bart Howard’s Fly Me to the Moon also plays a major part as the BGM for one of the more stunning game sequences in episode 1.

What Could’ve Been Better

As much as I enjoyed the drama, I thought 9 episodes were somewhat overlong. 6 or 7 episodes would have made the storytelling more compact and compelling. A significant portion of the drama was taken up by the story-building of the main character as well as four other major supporting characters. I appreciated the respective backstories of tragic circumstances and such but those components impacted on the pacing of the more engaging aspects a little bit. In addition, the final episode did feel dragged out unnecessarily.

The characterization of the ML Seong Gi Hoon (no 456) wasn’t convincing to me, although I accepted it as part of the drama’s depiction of “character growth”. How an irresponsibly hopeless father, unfilial son, and washed-out gambling addict suddenly developed a moral compass, sense of righteousness, and leadership traits came across as somewhat unrealistic.

Overall

Notwithstanding the qualms I had and as long as expectations are tempered, Squid Game represents great entertainment value complete with a sufficient dose of suspense, thrills and excitement in a nicely packaged production that makes it the perfect binge-worthy viewing experience for an evening at home.

Hold onto your pants, it's going to be a wild ride...
This drama is probably the biggest shocker I’ve got this year. Since I’ve finished Devil Judge I thought that nothing good will happen to me this year in terms of kdramas and I’m so happy that I was wrong. I didn’t have high hopes, since I didn’t really know what to expect from it. And boy, was it a wild ride.

So the idea is pretty familiar and I think that’s what put me to sleep at first. Over four hundred most desperate people stand to a fight for life and death to win a ridiculous amount of money. They need to compete in a games that resemble child play but the slightest slip may result in a gruesome death.

The whole drama looks very innocent, with those live pastel colours everywhere. Contrasted with violence and blood that basically everywhere it all adds up to a very weird detached from reality feeling. And the tasks also seem pretty innocent. Just until machine guns fire up to kill anyone that break the rules of the game.

Let’s talk about acting. From the beginning till the end everything is absolutely perfect (I’ll quickly ignore English speaking actors, since we know not to expect anything from them. Let’s just say, I’ve seen much worse). We have fantastic Lee Jung Jae in the main role and Park Hae Soo that I’ve doubted before (loved him in Prison Playbook but still wasn’t sure about his acting skills) but no more. The rest is equally amazing, but I'd have to list the whole cast here. Let's just say there's no weak link here. And cameos are pure gold. I’ll refrain myself from spoiling who shows up here, but just wait for it.

And the whole premise of it. At first I thought we’ll see something similar to teen dystopian stories that were so popular past couple of years. You know, Hunger Games and the rest that emerged on the wave of it’s popularity. But this drama focuses more on the true human nature. What people can do when they have no other option but to fight. How far they’ll reach just to survive. And we see truly heartbreaking choices that our heroes must make. We quickly discover that they’re not so pure of heart that we thought at first. But who would be with a gun pointed to their face.

Overall this drama shook me to the core. I was glued to the screen for whole nine hours of it and honestly it doesn’t happen often. It kept me at the end of the seat with barely any rest, as the characters that had no time to relax I’ve also felt continuous pressure. I’m writing it shortly after finishing the last episode and I think that those emotions will stay with me for quite a while. This drama is a gem and I hope to see more like that.

""The poor lacks much, but the greedy lacks more.""
It's true that humanity survives on greed and as they state, there is no greater calamity than greed. A man's greed is like a snake that wants to swallow an elephant. From the synopsis, this drama might look like a survival game to you, but it's much more than that. Somehow, despite it's message the drama is just mediocre. Watch it with a major TRIGGER WARNING, if you are sensitive to gore and dark elements.

Squid game (Ojingeo) is an age old Korean game meant for kids where you have to play within marked boundaries with certain designated titles. You have to secure your title by hoping on one leg first and if you reach a certian point, you become the ""Royal Inspector"" who can use it's both legs. Now you have to just defense the opponent by any means and reach the peak to win. The drama uses this game as the main objective through a flashback in the beginning which is also the destination of the story journeying through sets of several games.

Ki Hoon (Lee Jung Jae), an unemployed and divorced man in his 40s lives with his mother working as a chauffeur and huge sum of money oweing to loansharks. Sang Woo (Park Hae Soo), is an SNU graduate who lost his money through invested stocks, eventually turning into a conman. Both of them are childhood friends who loved playing squid game with others kids. Both of them come across some kind of agents who trick them into a game where they can win a huge sum of money. Not knowing what exactly the game is, both of them choose to give it a try and land up in an unsual environment with 454 others among whom Ki Hoon is the last, i.e. 456.

Lee Jung Jae and Park Hae Soo are master actors in the industry which everyone is aware of. Other than them there are plenty of familiar faces as well; Jung Ho Yun, Wi Ha Joon, Heo Sung Tae, Kim Joo Ryung, Oh Young Soo are those prominent actors. There is an Indian actor Anupam Tripathi in the main character too.

Other than that there are 2 very big shots in the drama with 2-3 scenes so we can call that guest roles but trust me, they are 2 of the key characters in here. You won't find them in the cast list, just to be surprised watching the drama. So go ahead, haha.

The games are quite intriguing if you have not watched likes of it (Liar Games, Alice on the Borderland, etc). I wonder why the screenwriter cum director Hwang Dong Hyuk took 10 years to complete this story. I mean this drama is nothing sort of very wow or anything. Judging from all the aspects, it's just mediocre. The drama fails to provide proper side stories for the main roles in order to back their characters well.

Cinematography, which is very important for dark thrillers like this, was pretty beguile, hence keeping the viewer attached. The sound ending was apt for the mood and very suitable to the scenarios. The story progression is okay but becomes out of order or inconsistent at many points, especially the last 3 episodes. Some scenes were very firm and eye-catching but still......

I think all the hype about this drama lies on the fact that people here die like mere insects and as we know violence and bloodlust are what people love the most, lol. The twists are pretty predictable, particularly when you're an avid Kdrama fan, it's pretty much easier to guess the major plots of it.


The finale is very lousy. The games end in the beginning of the episode and becomes slow. The lame setup towards the ending, indicating for an another season, annoyed the shit outta me. The writer-director did a very poor job in that regard as well.

Soooo....overally, SQUID GAME is an average one time watch. The ending is not exactly an open one, like we can just assume on our own but in another way you might expect one in case the production hints at it. Otherwise, there is no particular and firm necessity of another season. Sure there are few questions that they left unanswered but I can't be certain about another season.

Better than Hollywood...
Korean kdramas and movies are truly a discovery during this time of pandemic and lockdowns. Their stories are so unique and a joy to watch. Oftentimes, there are lessons to be learned no matter the genre.

Squid Games is no different. Dark in theme, enjoyable to watch. This show has kept me on edge during each game. You never know how many will make it through to the next round. The setting for each scene was well though of and you can see that no expense was spared to make it as over the top as possible.

But more than just the games and the action, it shows what lengths some people would go through when in dire need for money. People from all walks of life may show the world a different side of themselves, but deep down, they are undergoing so many struggles just to survive.

If you are not squeamish at the sight of blood and gore, give this a try.

If you want to see this concept done well - watch Alice in Borderland
What is to like: the cast and set design is very good quality.
What I don't like:
The idea of the games according to the 'host' was to make them equal. They were anything but equal, just take the last game (crossing the bridge) as the perfect example - people that picked the first numbers had 0% chance of survival, whilst those at the end had almost guaranteed survival.
The 'organ selling' sub-plot went no-where.
The main charater was sold to us as this guy down on his luck. This is incorrect, he was just a pathetic gambling addict. I was actually happy his daughter was taken away. Not a character to root for.

I'm only writing this to make some people aware that this drama is just overhyped because it was produced in a more 'americanised' style. There weren't any signature korean OSTs to remember and there were a lot of senseless deaths (this is all too common in american shows). Overall, as a show it is pretty average but for a korean show it is pretty disappointing. Like the title says - Alice in Borderland beats this drama by a large margin for me.

beautiful and nerve-wracking at the same time.
Did not expect this will be terrifying about blood. I love the main story about your childhood game. the first episode may not be too interesting because most of it is still in the character introduction stage. but after episode 2 I couldn't stop watching it and finished this series in one night.
the cinematography is beautiful, the shots are well taken. for the acting of the actors is no doubt, they do it very professionally. a cameo from the ""class A"" actor makes the plot twist even more exciting, hehe.
my heart is racing really fast every game. it's very stressful but I still enjoy watching it. oh, one more thing, I've never watched any other survival game-themed movies/series, so this is the first time for me. this series is very adrenaline pumping LOL. :D

Greed brings out a man's real face
Was very excited about the drama since the trailer came out. Watched it all in one sitting without any break and all I can say is that it was worth it. Basically a mix of 'Hunger Games' and 'Alice in Borderland' but with a twist of its own keeping the Korean flavour of the games. The suspense was everything! The feeling of knowing what will happen next, who will survive, what the secrets are -keeps you watching the episodes one after another. So if you're questioning whether to watch it or not, my only response will be YES. DO IT!

Gets you on the edge but rather predictable
This series was quite easy to binge due to its shorter nature but also due to it being very eventful. The story is well thought-out and rather unique from some of your more typical dramas. However, there is gore and may not suit everyone’s taste. Personally, I’m not great with blood and gore but I’ve definitely seen worse. But, this is a drama where the story is quite predictable. Most of the time you can almost every time assume what’s going to happen next. The cast is also very diverse and acted extremely well to create different emotions and moods. I would highly recommend this drama.

When childhood games becomes deadly!
For me, "" Squid Game"" is a mixture of Alice in Borderland, Hunger Games, and Battle Royal, wherein you need to do things you thought you're not capable of doing in order to survive. I finished the entire series in a day as it's very engaging and the character's background stories are all very intriguing and will leave you on edge. This series is lined up with some of the big names in SoKor drama land, which is a gift for us, as they didn't disappointment me with their capabilities to deliver their lines, characters, and emotions. If you don't like bloody scenes, violence and suicide, stay away from this series as it may cause triggering effect. Also, the root of evil aside from greed, is money, this series, shows it all. But overall, you'll enjoy the series, so watch it.

Great suspense throughout, but the ending was not worth it.
The show hooks you right away within the first episode, but as the climax comes into play and the cards are laid out, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.

The characters don't make sense, especially Gi Eun and Sang Woo. Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere, and it's apparent towards the end.

Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by sheer luck. He also seem to have forgotten that he got into the game for his daughter. Throughout the series, Gi Eun was portrayed as a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don't get what he's thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE? Don't blame the game, but the player.

Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It's not within his character to stab himself. He didn't even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok. So what gave him the sudden change of heart?

The reveal of player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already. It felt forced, and I did not buy into his motivations. Also, the game preaches equality, but the old man keeps helping out our main guy on multiple occasions. The rules don't seem to matter.

We also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.

I had other nitpicks with the other characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie with implausible character development.

In retrospect, the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch for the most part. The actors did a fine job, and I think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge it, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money and greed don't buy happiness then it works out. But this ending? CHEAP.

6.5.

Really not much too it
It was just ok, the games really weren't all that inventive - I would have liked more strategy and puzzle solving before killing 1/2 the players each round. It's also pretty obvious from the get go what it's going to come down to. The VIP scenes were some of the worst ever. They really think it's more exciting in person when all they do is sit like 100 yards from the action and watch through opera glasses while wearing the most ungainly masks ever created? The VIP lounge was just boring. Ultimately this drama is a bit flat and missing any real spark.

Before you watch Squid Game...
To watchers from conservative countries/religious countries:
Note that Squid Game has an UNCENSORED sex scene in one of its episodes (I forgot which episode) and if you are alone, it's still better to put on your ear/headphones than watching it out loud. Watch it at your own risk.

Here is my review:
Pros:
- Episode 1 - 8 will never make you bored, so I'm sure you can binge-watch it without getting distracted
- Unpredictable side-plot that makes the games more interesting
- Thrilling
- Characters who participated in the games are varied
- Different from Alice in Wonderland, Squid Games don't have those confusing-puzzle-games because SG are based on childhood games

Cons:
- Too many side stories are missing
- Plot holes everywhere
- You can definitely guess who will be the winner lmao
- Unfinished and unpolished ending

WORTH IT to watch for?
- You who are looking for a fast-paced thrilling easy-to-understand drama.
- You who are bored watching romance/comedy-drama.
- You who wants to join your friends' convo about this drama.

NOT WORTH IT to watch for?
- You who are looking for drama with a good main plot and/or plot twists.
- You who are looking for drama without 18+ scenes.
- You who are looking for a long thrilling drama like ""Mouse"".

Killing the innocence, dehumanizing humanity.
Dark portrayals of greed, low self value and distorted view of reality based on the twisted social standards that are rooted in the obsession over money that takes away all the joy of life - all wrapped in a completely unrealistic scenario sprinkled with dark comedy tone, that emphasizes the absurdity of the characters’ choices and behaviors.

The childlike locations and games present a drastic contract to the brutality of the scenarios the characters are facing. The game creators put themselves in the position of innocent keepers of the rules, and any tragic deaths are the fault of the participants for breaking them. No one is forced to participate - you signed your death certificate yourself.

Survival in the game and survival in daily life serve as another good contrast - the physical brutality versus the emotional and existential dread. It’s more than survival games drama, the true horror is the reality of these people outside of the games and what they can do in the given situation to change it.

The aspect of Squid Game I definitely appreciated was the different perspective we were able to witness - we weren’t only following the players. The behind the scenes gave this unrealistic scenario more down to earth feel - witnessing the pink umpa lumpas with some despicable, but human qualities were for me a good writing choice. The whole mystery of the workers was a small part of the plot, yet so interesting. Sadly, it did not really lead anywhere.

Here’s the thing though - I kind of wanted the majority of the people to die at the beginning. They were really painfully unlikable, and not in the “he annoyed me a bit”, but rather “kind of a trash human being” type of way. Luckily, as the drama progressed and we started to understand their backgrounds, I was able to empathize with some, and even if I disagreed with many of their choices, I still felt bad for what may happen and how they might end.

Blood and murder are this show’s best friends - be aware of that before watching. Realistically speaking, this is not some new higher level of gruesome scenes, but they don’t shy away from showcasing deaths and accidents.

The acting from all the adults was truly amazing. Like in any drama, some roles had more depth and were more demanding than others, but none of the characters felt like an empty placeholder to fill the scene.

But then we had the group of foreign actors with such an exaggerated line delivery, I was thinking I’d rather mute the screen. Not one of them did a good job. All sounded like licence free sound bites.

Any flaws or complaints?

Depends on what you are looking for. Do not expect any elaborate death traps and clever tricks - it’s far more simple. It is pure survival with technically simple rules and games. You won’t wreck your brain trying to understand what is going on, since the plot is rather straightforward with no unexpected plot twists that turn the whole plot upside down.

You might want to sit down and analyze the message of the show and what might be the meaning behind. Depending on the viewer it could be a decent kill count watch with a bit of excitement, or a depressing portrayal of collapsing morals and society, as the money sucks all the joy out of our lives.

EPILEPSY WARNING IN EPISODE 4 - not a complaint, but something viewers for sure should know before starting it. This is the type of filming I cannot enjoy. I lose interest when I can’t really see what is going on. I know, it was done on purpose. I know, the chaotic atmosphere was the point. I still don’t like it.

There has also been a random sex scene, and I don’t think we needed that “final” nail in the coffin - it was clear even without it that people would do anything for survival and money.

Some details make exactly zero sense, and I truly mean zero. If you are lucky, you will not notice them at all, since they are less than minor. Squid Game is not exactly free from plot holes, but none of them have a big impact on the story. Some plot lines do hit the dead end though.

The reasoning behind the games? Kind of weak. I was hoping for them to give some unexpected twist, but in the end, they went with exactly what I expected them to show. The more they explained, the less I liked it. The last few episodes started to take away from the message of the show, which lowered the quality of the watch quite a bit. It was going so well… and then it didn’t.

Overall, it was a brutal drama, yet somehow I found myself laughing at quite a number of scenes. The dark comedy, calling out the hypocrisy - all that was truly amazing. 2/3 of the show was a solid 9.5, and I’m a bit frustrated with where the show went after that. Still, quite an enjoyable watch, with interesting set designs, well written characters and some solid thrills. They were able to get me attached to the characters and feel their desperation and pain. One of the episodes truly broke me, and I was thankful for that.

Rough draft
There's been thousands of death games since 1970s and the fact that done in Asia. I expected typical romance overtop melodrama stories. I was completely wrong and show caught me off by suprise, so I'll have to watch it again to fully analyze the show. It is clear the show has a lot subtext and hidden meaning. Children games, Colors, Shapes, and Numbers was used through the entire show. What I have so far:

blue group = underclass/minority
#= most are in extreme debt, immigrants, elderly, etc.

red group = working class
Circle = Cooks, Drivers, etc
Triangle = The Police
square = The Managers /Supervisers

Blue and red colors are constantly used throughtout the show. Which is part of South Korean flag known as the Taegeuk. The blue represents the negative cosmic forces and the red represents positive cosmic forces as the yin and yang. You have the blue group labeled as numbers and red group as shapes.

black= govt
frontman = enforces the rules

The rules so far:
Player consent form
1. player is not allowed to stop playing
2. player who refuses to play will be eliminated
3. Games maybe terminated if the majority agrees.

O rules
1. always wear mask
2. Do not converse without permission
3. Do not leave the room without permission

yellow = Yellow light shinging on top of the pig = wealth and fortune

The core of the show seems to be social experiment on meritocracy and commentary on social classes.

Gratuitous violence
To begin my review, I'm someone who doesn't like gratuitous violence. But, if the story was interesting enough or if I had liked the protagonist I could still enjoy it. But that's not what happened. I didn't like the protagonist at all and that's nothing new about the plot, and the games were no fun either. There were times that the pacing was horrible, just couldn't stand it. The production it's amazing, but I've watched kdramas enough to know that they are almost always amazing. Overall if you like more of a battle royale story with good production and don't mind that the characters are mostly scumbags, give it a try. If you are more like me, who doesn't enjoy gratuitous violence and that needs to empathize with the protagonist to enjoy the story, there are plenty of better kdramas out there.

Hunger (For Money) Games Deliver Battle Royale
Wow! What an incredible, tense drama! You will be at the edge of your seat all the time, and just when you think you figured out everything, new twists are revealed. I'd say the only tiny drawback is that the ending seems set up for Season 2, but I couldn't dock points for that. It's still a self-contained story that wraps up nicely and answers the main question.

Cast is absolutely fantastic and they play well-defined characters with clear motivations. It's an excellent study of human nature under pressure. There are precious cameos by 2 big name actors but I won't reveal who they are, who they are playing and when they appear. Discover for yourself. You'll go ""No way!"" I promise.

The plot is a great take on games to the last man or woman standing so fans of Hunger Games, Battle Royale and Alice In Borderland should enjoy this. It's thrilling, but most importantly, emotional beats hit you hard. Episode 6 in particular is a weeper.

Use of The Blue Danube that signals the beginning of the games is a stroke of genius. So familiar and yet so chilling given the context.

Netflix money makes a difference. You will be amazed when you see production design. It's incredible.

I'm shocked that the rating is only 8.2 atm. WTF, MDL? Is it because there's no romance? Only that could explain why drivel like True Beauty is rated higher.

I finished 9 episodes in a day and a half. What are you waiting for? :)

Don't skip past this show!
This has been the only k-show I've ever seen where I was not bored. Every minute of it kept me interested and on the edge of my seat. The show is ruthless with it's characters and that is something that makes this show so unique. The production is fantastic and these scenes are very cool. The storyline itself is so interesting and makes me think about how many good people are there really in this world.
One thing that I didn't like about it was the weird ending, it felt abrupt other than that throughout the whole thing it never got old or went down in interest level.

The Hunger Games Without Substance...like eating a cake shaped piece of cardboard.
I struggle to rate this drama highly. On one hand, it was well done with beautiful cinematography....on the other hand it is a pretty overdone genre across all countries. Sick, demented, rich people playing a game with less fortunate people's lives. I didn't really see anything new or innovative in this tale, it's the same old story dredged up again with blood spouts sprinkled in for effect. It's one of the single most overdone themes in horror. And, while the backstories and human character development made it tolerable, I still struggle to understand why this sort of show still draws viewers.

Recently, I watched Alice in Borderland, which is a similarly themed violent games survival drama. Alice in Borderland was much more effectively done, however, and added in the mystery element of who was controlling the game much more effectively along multiple other story arcs. Squid Game, on the other hand, focused more on trying to force parallels between the players' poverty lifestyles and the lifestyles of the game creators/betters. Simultaneously trying to convince you that all people are vile while also fighting to convince you of the opposite through various redemption arcs. The main theme that a select few characters seem to be fighting against is that all human beings are morally depraved monsters when their life/money is on the line.

In the end, I think the drama tried to be deeper than it was. It spent too much time forcing the viewer's opinions of people/situations into trite knotholes and ended up limiting itself with its inane rhetoric, especially at the end. Usually, I'm a fan of dramas with dark themes and ambiguous, unhappy endings...but this one I didn't like much. It's just another regurgitation of depraved humanity with nothing new or insightful to add to the existing backlog of dialog from exactly the same story.

That said, the lead actor was great in this drama. He did an incredible job realistically depicting a wide variety of emotional states. His reactions were on point in almost every case. Unfortunately, he was pretty much the only one who produced that range of emotions, so the viewer is forced to interpret situations based almost entirely on his reactions.

One of the best elements of a good Kdrama is how intensely they develop even minor characters. This drama had only 5 or so developed characters out of hundreds, the rest were just fodder for the blood cannon. Even characters that seemed initially well developed, actually end up being just cheap tools to reiterate the drama's main theme. Like the police officer looking for his brother, you eventually realize his only purpose in the drama is to get a peek at behind the scenes horror. His story didn't matter, all that mattered was that the audience had another set of disposable eyes to look through. The North Korean defector's story ended up being the same, pointless and just tossed in to provide a single tear jerk moment and a generic plot device for the lead to rebound off of. The characters, apart from the lead, had zero depth, the entire thing was intensely superficial.

Overall, I wouldn't watch this show again. A season 2 where the lead (minus that horrible red hair) fights against the game creators would be interesting, but a season 2 with the same exact show and a different cast I wouldn't go near. It was vile, but vile without the usual Kdrama depth of philosophy/morality exploration. I can't see myself ever recommending it. Out of every Kdrama I've ever watched I can only think of a small handful that I gained nothing from watching, this is down there in the heap with those few. Challenge my ideas, make me think about the world in a different way, or at the very least entertain me...if you can't do any of that, gtfo.

Copied storyline with a weird ending and way too much blood
I watched this, because everyone keeeps talking about this series.
Postitive points: Very good production, high quality. The actors gave a great performance. Really can't say anything bad about that!
Negative points: The whole story is just.... well it reminds me a lot of Alice in Borderland. Expect that Alice in Borderland was a lot better in my opinion. The ending of Squid game is kinda predictable and not satisfying at all. There isn't really a happy ending for anyone.
Tbh i don't get the hype. There are way better Korean/ Asian series out there. Still, I think it's cool that people start recognizing Korean / Asian series/ movies more :)
If you like blood, gore and mind f*ck this series is for you, if you don't, better watch something else.

Hype that will not stand up with time
Hype that will not stand up with time. This series does not measure up to the standards of good, much less great, Korean Drama. The cast is excellent, of course (except for the VIPs, though the inside joke on American actors is rich), but the plot is predictable from the beginning through to the end. From the moment 001 (a heavy-handed clue) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was predictable.

However. Blessings on Netflix for bringing international film to the world, especially during the pandemic. But don't try to own it, guys: just stream it.

Done with Squid Game and to be honest I was really disappointed.
Watched too many films/dramas until I can guess almost all plot points/twists most of the time now... Could see plot twists coming from a long way out and character motivations were not convincing at all either from the get-go. Even the amount of prize money at stake was not convincing to me. The westernized scenes were really unnecessary. Objectively speaking, the religious references were also highly unnecessary? We really do not need such references to flesh out humans' self-righteousness. Satire throughout the drama could have been done much more tastefully but everything just felt like they were afterthoughts.

Many Korean stylistic elements that I enjoy which make up great Korean productions' scripts so far were sadly missing from Squid Games' script which I am also disappointed about. Character motivations and development are so important for such survival games genre so this was really shocking for me since most of the time Korean dramas do not fail in this aspect... Especially shocking for a K-drama this hyped about.

Performances by Park Hae Soo and Heo Sung Tae and the production value were the only redeeming points. Lee Jung Jae was good as usual but his character was not as distinctive as Park's and sometimes felt sidelined in comparison even though he was the main character? His character was really a wasted opportunity in the script. I also felt the series could have been shortened by 2 episodes.

The final plot twist was bad too in my opinion. Trying to pull a Christopher Nolan Joker world view but again it did not work for me or even felt convincing.

Minor spoiler - And also, what is with the lack of diversity among the VIPs?

Expected much more from the critically acclaimed Korean writer/director Hwang Dong-hyuk who directed and wrote the impactful and disturbing film Silenced (2011). Netflix probably had some influence over the creative work here I feel... But I did enjoy the cameos though.

Beyond Evil is really so so much better in comparison. The Hunger Games films too.

As I finished Squid Game last weekend I saw it was # 1 on Netflix. On my tiny little island of all places. Just a couple of years ago people scoffed at me when they found out I was watching kdramas. Squid Game is basically just a korean movie that has been extended to 9 episodes and in many ways I think it is a very typical gory and violent story that you often find in Korean movies. Something that has been slowly finding its way into Korean television in recent years, especially with shows produced by Netflix. And it is clear that a lot was put into this series from what it's visuals, to the choice of actors and the budget etc.

As I said Squid Game was a bit of a typical story from this type of entertainment that you often find in movies from countries like Japan and Korea (like Battle Royal) and for me it was not that original with them and neither did they do something new with this type of narrative. Which may be why there was very little to the story that actually surprised me. even if I really enjoyed watching it. I found it a bit typical and it mainly just reminded me of other such stories that have come before it.

The violence is not for everyone. I can stomach quite a bit of it without it bothering me. I often think the violence in this type of stories goes a little too far but there is a purpose to it in some ways and the story puts a lot of pressure on your endurance as a spectator, because that is the purpose of it. It's hard for the characters, it should be hard on you. You can hardly look away even if you want to and that is one of the traits of these types of stories. And in that Squid Game is very successful.

The story starts off with a bang, but after that is does take it's time to find it's footing but when it manages it toward the middle part the show becomes really binge-able, before taking a slight dip towards the end. The theme of the effects of late stage capitalism and it's grip on our society and the situation that has created among us is very interesting and the story does a good job underlining that.

Really good amount of suspense going on there and some good character moments in between them, although I thought the story never really took full advantage of it's characters as it spent more time on other aspects of the story. It was also a little too noticeable to me that this was written by a man based on how some of the characters were written and it bothered me a bit. I think the choice of actors, who are all great, made the character more interesting than they might be.

I felt the ending was a little too empty which slightly made the ride on this roller-coaster of a story slightly less thrilling. It didn't leave that much behind. I felt I was missing some emotional payoff from the story. I felt like the personal journey was a bit lacking in the end so it didn't stick the landing. And I didn't feel like enough questions were answered in the narrative. It was as if the story was relaying little too much getting another series. And I appreciate kdrams for giving me complete stories in one season.

This is a nine-part gory Korean film. It really felt like it was made with that sort of target audience in mind; those who really enjoy this genre of Korean and Japanese films (as this is one of the most popular genres of Asian films in the west, which I sometimes find a bit sad but I also understand the appeal). It's good gory entertainment and I can see why it is as popular as it is. It's thrilling, violent and addictive while it's going on but it didn't leave me with much in the end except maybe blood and gore.

Much talked about but very predictable drama.
I'm watching this drama for all the rampage behind it and while I enjoyed watching it, I think it's just another survival drama.

There is really nothing innovative, maybe just the fact that the games were simple because they were based on children's games but after that it is just a group of desperate people, for different reasons, willing to do whatever it takes to win. the award.

The acting was excellent as well as how everything was executed but let's say that all the characters fulfilled a stereotype of this type of genre.

The message was also the same as those often given in these dramas: ""How much can we lose our humanity because of our ambitions?"" There is nothing really remarkable, other than the performances, because everything was so predictable.

Even the end and there were characters who died stupidly and there was no great development.

Maybe I'm tough but it's because everyone talked so much about him that they created great expectations, that people like me who enjoy watching this type of genre didn't bring him anything new and innovative.

I still recommend it because it's not that bad. It is short and entertaining.

Boring and Disappointing
I will keep this short because I have nothing but negative things to say about this drama.

The games were boring and anticlimactic, the plot is extremely predictable, there were way too many annoying characters and unnecessary drama, cringeworthy acting from some of the supporting characters (don’t get me started on the VIPs), the cinematography was not as good as I expected from the trailer, and lastly, the ending was so bland.

If you're looking for a suspenseful survival game type of drama, watch Alice in Borderland instead. I'm still giving it a rating higher than 5 because as much as the plot is predictable and banal, I still paid enough attention while watching and it was fun guessing what would happen next.

How unsettling
This show has become a phenomenon. But I need to be real with myself — this kind of show (with all its gore, stress, and bad decisions) was not for me. It's like acclaimed movies like the Joker or Us: the kind with an impactful social message conveyed in an unsettling way. I could've lived without watching this show, and I would've been happier for it. They say ignorance is bliss, and I'm honestly starting to believe it.

Squid Game was inspired by the highly acclaimed Liar Game. I LOVED the original Japanese version of Liar Game. But what I've come to realize is that I enjoy the STRATEGY more than the desperation. Liar Game focuses on the games. Squid Game has good moments of that, like the dalgona and tug-of-war. But for the most part, Squid Game is a brutal display of human desperation. It is more ""Lord of the Flies"" than Liar Game; it offers social commentary on the forgotten people who struggle and the dire circumstances by which they live. But I don't feel particularly sympathetic to the plight of most of the characters regardless (except our North Korean gal and Ali; but the rest are unlikeable to a fault).

There were also some completely bizarre choices: the VIPs for one (it's rushed to squeeze them in as if this is The Hunger Games on top of everything else... you're trying to do too much), and our MC's hair colour for another (haha, kidding). A lot of the circumstances of the game were left annoyingly open-ended, which is such a bad habit from Netflix. I love kdramas for being self-contained, single-series stories. I DON'T want to anticipate another season in a year or two after I've forgotten everything and stopped caring about everyone. I don't want to have to deal with stupid casting changes and stretched storylines just to fulfill the production contracts offered to successful blockbusters, guaranteed to keep people watching. It's so greedy. Perhaps that's fitting for a show surrounding greed, desperation, and wealth?

But beyond my gripes with Netflix-and-the-western-serial format as a whole, if I were to judge the show as a standalone, then it was unfulfilling BECAUSE of the loose threads left open about the meta of the game. I said what I said.

I was really excited and have high expectation for the series ever since the teaser dropped. no, probably ever since we got the title name. as I only watch kdrama, not american series anything, this is of course very unique and refreshing. The whole playing games while betting your life was just damn, couldn't help but to be intrigue and watch it right away. The storyline and the sets, the games were amazing. even though there are few episodes that were slow, because I want moree games, I feel like the stories are important for me to understand their characters. It was 'bloody' amazing, and very thrilling. It reminds me of sweet home sometimes, the editing probably. Acting was of course greattt I mean, we expected that. Anyways I love and enjoy it a lot. and we need season 2, i wasn't satisfied with the ending.

Squid Game is not worth your time
The premise of the show is similar to Hunger Games- lots of people in an arena who are pitted against each other and only one can survive. The show starts off okay with an okay protagonist who has his share of problems many of which he is responsible for himself. Then it manages to grip you for the next two while establishing that the games were created to be fair and equal to these miserable participants. Unfortunately, it goes sideways from the fourth episode and seemingly stops being fair and introduces some other characters only to give our protagonists a chance to appear smarter. The games themselves aren't very novel and exceedingly turn away from children's games into the aforementioned hunger games. All is then conveniently wrapped up in the last two episodes without any explanation. It really irked me how many useless plot threads were introduced and remained unresolved. The show-writer believed perhaps that the audience would be dumb and hence enjoy the gorefest they have prepared without any sense. For each major plot thread to be wrapped up completely, each ""grey"" villain was turned into a complete psychopath as most villains at the end of k-dramas do. The games are built such that females do not get a fair and equal chance at them instead of that being the whole premise of each game. The actors themselves act well and deliver convincing performances. The music is forgettable.

Pros:
-interesting premise and concept
-nice film texture, sets
-fine actings from the cast
-quite gripping and thrilling during the games

Cons:
-some draggy parts although this only 9 eps lol. Maybe got too much talking
-old man plot twist need more explanations?
-i wish there are more game parts and more challenging games lol
-cliches here and there

But overall a good production and enjoyable watch. Love that ifs only 9 eps. With the ckiffhanger at the end, will they make a sequel?

Unexpected binge watch
Took this on based on Netflix recommendation and binged all 9 episodes. Admittedly it had a strong hunger games vibe but the story plot and character linkages had me hooked. Unexpected twists at the end. Wow, I was pleasantly surprised when it finished. The only gripe I have is that I'm not a fan of the foreign actors typically cast in kdramas. It's like they bring in foreigners living in korea with no acting skills. The foreign actors cast in this series I felt brought down the calibre of acting of the korean actors. Also limiting their script to swearing and yelling obscenities was frustrating - ugh!

Other than that it was a solid series.

Squidward has more appeal ...
Another flop from Netflix.

Do they change writers halfway on projects?

Or maybe they just toss storylines up in the air and go with which one hits the floor first.

It seems the expectations for a good watch are falling lower and lower.

Society is now entertained by the glibbest drivel.

This was way overhyped and had more holes than a slice of swiss cheese.

Maybe I am just too critical and think too much, but most of this was unrealistic.

Too many moments of cringe based off of the lack of simple logic not being used.

And that's putting it kindly.

We're continually being mocked by the elite, why subject ourselves to more mindless tv based on this concept?

LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!!
At it's worst, what desperation can mean to many when pushed to the maximum, even at the cost of gambling their lives away in life threatening games. Competing for the grand cash prize of ₩45 Billion (USD38 Million), these contestants know that it is the only way for them to resolve their financial problems which are hounding them incessantly in their daily lives. Hence, the game starts with the famous ""Red Light, Green Light"" ....followed by a series of childhood games which gets harder and thrilling by each episode. Imagine....as the game starts with 456 contestants, ending with ""Squid Game"", with ONE last person standing in the end...., how many are 'assassinated' along the way, as each and everyone try to stay alive in whatever means they can.

This genius of a drama is not only able to keep our attention with it's visually and mentally thrilling games, but as it unfolds, it also tells a story of basic human nature of kindness, love, greed, betrayal, sacrifice and much much more depicting the good and bad that exists in each of us. And that, when it comes the time to decide, one can 'choose' to do the right thing.......or not.

Like many, I was also SURPRISED by this survival drama. Not a fan of action dramas and too over-loaded by romance drama, I was not thinking that Squid Game will be a likely choice for me to watch. Thought I'd just watch one episode and call it a day. But, I kept hanging on to it and spent a full day binge watching 9-episodes and after that thought to myself 'dang', what a fabulous show, even till the last drop!

I have not seen Lee Jun Jae since 2010, ""The Housemaid"", that I nearly forgot what a great actor he is. In Squid Game, he played his character Gi Hun (No. 456) so well, from the gullible, trusting, loser of a guy to a true survivor, is well deserved of an award. His best friend Sang Woo - No. 218 (Park Hae Soo) is no slacker too, who in the drama, is the head of an investment team at a securities company, wanted by police for cheating his clients.

The rest of the cast (1) Sae Byeok-No. 67 (Jung Ho Yeon) North Korean defector, (2) Il-Nam-No. 1 (Oh Yeong Su) elderly man with a brain tumor, (3) Deok Su-No. 101 (Heo Sung-taek-su) a gangster with massive gambling debts, (4) Abdul Ali-No. 199 (Anupam Tripathi) a Pakistani foreign worker, (5) Han Mi-nyeo-No. 212 (Kim Joo-ryoung) a mysterious and manipulative woman who claims to be a poor single mother AND (6) Wi Ha-joon -Guard No. 29 (Hwang Jun-ho) a police officer who sneaks into the Game as a guard to find his missing brother are ALL worth mentioning for their perfect acting. Not a single flaw and had great energy playing off each other's strengths and together with the two main leads.

Such a memorable show. As you watch, there are also many clues from what the actors say and surroundings.....keep a look out on the walls too! This drama has now such a huge global following....kudos to another Korean show that is truly entertaining and well suited for international consumption.

And, finally, last but not the least, having Gong Yoo and Lee Byung Hun in special appearances was the icing on the cake!! Writer and Director Hwang Dong Hyuk (who also directed Gong Yoo in ""Silenced"") did a fabulous job. Such a genius, I await eagerly for the second season of Squid Game.

Squid Game is a highly recommended watch, don't miss it!

confusingly good.
This is a show where you would cry, get excited & be confused af.
I was so excited watching this series, because I knew it would be good
and it was trending all around especially it’s a netflix series.

So, was it worth to watch?
Yes, It was really good it’s thrilling & the fact that I finished it in 1 day it’s
because it was really thrilling & interesting to watch.
But if you have a kid watching this with you, please remember that it may traumatized
your child even me lmao…

Story: 9/10
The story was good, It’s about adults playing kids game back in their childhood
trying to survive for money.
It shows how humans can risk their lives just for it, and at the end is all regrets
A huge lesson that money can maybe less up your problems but can it be
your happiness?…you may get that huge piggy bank with billions of cash but at the end you will
feel guilty that the money your spending was all people’s lives.

I was also confused what will happen next im pretty sure there would be s2
because the ending was soooo questionable.

There’s also a huge plot twist which did not made me shock because of the stupid
spoilers in every social media app i used but i do not want to ruin the show so i will not
give any spoilers ^^

I also didn’t think that this series was gonna be painful i still can’t get over it
so be ready, get your tissues.

Acting/Cast: 9/10
The cast was great, their acting was good too.
They all pulled their character well, my faves would be Jung Ho Yeon & Lee Yoo Mi.

Lee Jung Jae (Seong Gi Hoon)- The personality of his character was kind of childish, he was
a bad dad & a bad son, imagine relaying to your mother who is literally old but he doesn’t care
but he had a lesson in the ending. he is kind tho :)

Park Hae Soo (Cho Sang Woo)- He was a traitor, imagine the so called “smart guy”
would do something that bad. (But still made me teared up at the end :()

Jung Ho Yeon (Kang Sae Byeok)- She’s reallly pretty she look like niki + felix but a girl & she was
blackpink jennie’s friend aww. (she is also a model)
This was her acting debut/first drama which made me shock her acting is soo good,
and her first drama was already a big hit rn. Looking forward for her next dramas.

Not much to say to her character she was really great.

The supporting roles was also good Ali was also my fave he was so kind-hearted but..
The old man made me cry the most he was so adorable in the drama but…
Lee Yoo Mi look like late sulli :( i love her…


Music: 5/10
Idrk if there was any music but the only one I remember was the first ep.
+ most of it was just instrumental but i’ll give a half score for that.

All flash but no heart however technically superb
Squid Game is a typical dystopian death game depiction with all the tropes that illustrate how humans are capable of the most egregious stuff when pushed to desperate levels . La , la . la.

Did Squid Game do something new , innovative and different in this drama? Not really . It was all rather typical and pretty predictable with an unsatisfying ending. However - it was TECHNICALLY sound.

The technicalities explored in bringing the story of Squid Game to our screens was masterful , adept and scintillating . The music , the wardrobe , the set and the visuals were all sublime . I found myself pausing to stare at the set design and all the intricacies of the visuals . The technicality shows through in the script too . The way the games were constructed especially the glass bridge was written masterfully . One of the best episodes of TV I have ever beheld is in ep 8 of Squid Game. Wonderful.

Now , I had a slight problem with Squid Game . I had a problem with its focus balancing . Focus balancing is when they are plots and subplots and the editors , directors et al balance that .i.e - the main plot has the adequate focus that a main plot should have and a sub plot is noticeably sub to a main plot. Maybe I am obtuse - but I felt as if there were plots that were too consummate to be a parallel or sub plot . Then the main plot just had flash , flash , flash of indulgent poverty and misfortune without much heart . So my emotional desires were being fulfilled elsewhere so in the end - I do not feel sated after watching Squid Game. I have an unbalanced view of it all.

This brings forward my next point with the cast . All did well , but again , the sub/parrallel plot guys showed up the guys in the main plot . The voice acting and tension that the actors showed playing the Pink Soldiers was sublime and top notch whereas the main cast was meh. I was loving the Pink Soldiers and the Front Man more than the main cast . However , I particularly loved Han Mi Yeo played by Kim Joo Ryung . So fantastically crass and vulgar. Everyone else was fine.

The music was fantastic atmosphere control too so top marks for that .

OVERALL- I am surprised that this is the drama that decided to have a chokehold on the global community but I do see its hype . It is a technical masterpiece. And all my points go to that .

Note:It is very gory , gruesome and unsettling egregious so know that when getting into watching this.

Great potential, yet overhyped
This kind of series is new for a Korean series, but nothing special in it.
Japanese has a lot series that has a plot like this such as liar game, as the god says, Alice in borderland and the list goes on and on.
As for western one we have Saw, Hunger games, Maze runner (maybe ?). and so on.
I get that the director want to picture how adult play like a kid for fortune in cost of a person life in a very realistic way. but they have no idea of what kind of game they should play, so they choose to copy it from any other series with a little bit changes. here is my break down.

First gathering :
everyone sent to the game with their own consent by calling the number from the invitation number yet still asks ""why should we trust you ?"". really ? wtf ? you should've ask that before give your consent on the phone. AND surprisingly nobody asked ""what will happened if i lost the game ?""

1st game Red/Green light game :
70 %+ of the scene copy pasted from as the god says. first they gathered the player, when the game started some random people gave zero shit about the condition and just play the game and get killed. after that everyone scared and scream and the game field become a massacre field, then a 4 eyed smart guy that get a trick to beat the game and save the day .the first game is the best example of copying and rephrasing a bit of your friends homework, good job Mr.director.

Second gathering & game restart:
everything f up. everybody scared, half of the participator want to go home and try to make a vote to stop the game, which supposed to be happened in the first gathering but no lets just vote after everyone is dead. realistic my ass.

2nd game The sugar cookie game:
I cant even call it a game, but okay lets just call it a game, everyone solving it with a brute force method nobody use their brain except for the MC and the noisy crazy girl. very realistic indeed. but at least it came from Korean culture which makes it unique I will give this game some point.

Night time war :
They changed from ""game"" concept to ""survival"" . people start kill each other just to win. the plot hole is nobody know that time that there will be only one winner or even they wont know if killing each other will make the game easier/faster

3rd game Tug of war:
Decent game not very unique, no Korean culture included. this game is just an easy answer for ""what should we play next. the trick to beat the game is ridiculous. I get that they want to picture brain over brawns. but did they actually did a research about this ?.

The cheating mess and the police investigation :
this plot used for season 2 possibilities. in my opinion its too weak considering how its end.

4th game marbles :
Also a decent game, and an easy option, but they give some Korean culture in here so the game is pretty much unique because you can play however you want. and i love how the characters grow here. the mc who neglect his mother start to care for the elderly more, the 4 eyed guy that struggle to keep his sanity losing his shit, and the girl who lost trust in people found start to trust someone.

5th game The stepping glass game :
I'm not Korean but I'm sure I've seen somewhere about Kids hearing old story about knocking the stone before you step to make sure its safe. so some culture included but surprisingly nobody does that until the last guy that know something abt the glasses. nobody even try to check the step with whatever they bring such as jacket/clothes or anything that can be used. nobody use their brain, where did the ""brain over brawls"" go from 3rd game ?.

3 last survivor :
I love this one. it pictures how they change after all of the game. the selfish girl became a pure hearted girl, the selfish gamble addict guy became a very caring guy, and the prodigy 4 eyed losing his shit

Last game, Squid game:
No game explanation, as a non-Korean I just see it like a 2 guy fist to fist fight. no meaning, no culture, nothing. ironic considering squid game is the title yet it was the worst game in the series.

The winner :
the after game , messed up mc losing his shit. classic drama. not bad, but not good either.

Conclusion :
A great potential series with a lot of ""but"" and "" it could be better"". not a very interesting series, I found myself fall asleep out of boredom few times. I don't know most of the actor/actresses, but i think they are good since i like how they potray the change of the characters during/after the game. None of the music stuck i my ears or get into my daily playlist, not the song/singer is bad is just the song choices for the theme or placements could have been better.
worth the watch ?. yes if you just want to Netflix and chill and love this kind of genre, no if you want to watch a really interesting psycho series.

The VIPs ruined it
Typical death game story. too predictable. Can't help compare to Alice in Borderland which was way better.

Likes: Lee Jung Jae was excellent. HoYeon Jung was a refreshing new face. Big name cameos. Design was stylish. Only 9 eps
Dislikes: THE VIPs. Worst voiceovers EVER. Completely ruined the drama

Next time, do us viewers a favor and set aside some of the budget to hire decent foreign actors so that your drama doesn't become stupid because of horrible acting. Thank you, that is all.

Best Korean Drama of 2021
This drama is 100% addictive and really keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first episode on until the very end. This is not your typical korean drama - the story of Squid Game is something completely new and extraordinary. Hopeless adults with more debt than they can ever pay off come together for a survival game consisting of mainly children’s games to hopefully survive and win an insane amount of money in the final game. From being excited, shocked, disturbed, scared, angry and sad, it really is an emotional rollercoaster that made me go through all the emotions.

Another thing that was absolutely fantastic about this drama were the many incredible sets that looked so real but so artificial at the same time and really made up the whole atmosphere of the drama. Together with the unsettling music and the amazing acting of the actors and actresses everything just worked together so very well.

Talking about the characters - the actors all did an amazing job. The characters were interesting and each had their individual story and reason to take part in the game. It was interesting to see their relationships with each other as well as the change they went through individually.

This drama had so many plot twists, hidden meanings and connections and really has me craving for more. There has to be a season 2 in the future!!!!

Lastly I do want to warn that this drama is very brutal and gory. So if you can‘t see violence or blood, this might not be a good choice for you!

excellent show with an excellent message
Just when I was in desperate need of something actually good to watch, these two words appeared EVERYWHERE, suddenly everyone had watched this show and was talking about how addicting it is. And they were absolutely not wrong. The plot keeps you on your toes the entire time, even for someone who is struggling to watch one-hour-long episodes. While not necessarily ""scary"", even if the violence was censored, this show was overwhelming in the best way possible, every single element of the show helped me feel exactly what I was supposed to feel, the anger, the sadness, the fear, and for that, I appreciate it a lot. But the most important thing here is the message. Sure, the plot, the production, the actors, everything was on point but the message was conveyed in such a good way that I was speechless. I think that this is a show definitely worth watching, especially if you are a fan of thrillers, this show will NOT disappoint you at all

Will have you hooked like crazy
A whole masterpiece. A masterpiece is the best and only way I can describe this drama. I binged all the episodes in a single day, each episode having me hooked and unable to wait to start the next.

It so perfectly portrays human instincts in life and death situations. How humans will forget all their morals and betray their close ones when money is in the picture. How we are so susceptible to greed and the inhumane extents we go to for money because of it. At the same time it also portrays any of the positive things that could happen in such a situation so realistically and beautifully, in the most moving way, keeping us hooked and giving us the hope that maybe humans aren't so bad.

Basically I just want to appreciate the way this drama had such a hold on my emotions, from giving me hope to killing the hope then bringing it back. How it challenged my mind on guessing to what's going to happen next.

I had been watching lots of romance and cheerful dramas recently and this was a well written change that I decided to watch. If you're considering watching this or are thinking of not watching it, I highly recommend you to re-think and give it a watch. You learn a lot about people and most of all, it really is just a good show in general (yes its sad and makes you mad and even very scared at times but that just shows how good it is).

The Mad Pastel Infused Survival World Of Hwang Dong Hyuk…

Hwang Dong Hyuk’s’ Squid Game’ is a world where the corruption of capitalism and moral decadence takes allegorical form in the vivid pastel hues of the game arenas.

The “ fight to survival” genre is nothing new in the world of dramas. ‘ Squid Game’ itself comes off as a weird fusion between ‘ Liar Game’ (with the unusual twist of South Korean childhood games) joined together with the blood-stained violence of ‘ Battle Royale’. However the series isn’t without its own unique twists. Even before stepping into the nightmare-fuelled pastel world of Dong Hyuk’s ‘ Squid Game’ prominent messages about South-Korean society from social prejudice, xenophobia, racism, sexism, misogyny and hypocrisy litter their way onscreen.

Actor Lee Jung Jae could vary between overacting with certain line deliverances, as well as oddly heartfelt as main character Ki Hoon . Ki Hoon has hit an all-time-low in life and spends his time between struggling to get out of debt, avoid gangsters and get time to spend with his daughter. When Ki Hoon is given the chance to participate in the game for ₩45.6 billion by Gong Yoo’s brief cameo as the mysterious and suave diplomat for the games , he soon runs in with childhood friend Sang Woo ( Park Hae Soo) and believes the opportunity to compete to be too good to be true. However Ki Hoon is given a new perspective upon life through games and his seeming amorality becomes replaced by feelings of remorse and guilt towards his past actions.

As the series progresses the series reveals that many of Ki Hoon’s competitors (and even the game guards) have their own personal moments of flaws, strengths and ulterior motives for being involved in the game. Ki Hoon’s old childhood friend Sang Woo ( Park Hae Soo) stands miles apart in Ki Hoon’s eyes initially as an alumni of Seoul National University ( one of the top South Korean universities) due to being an intelligent as well as an analytical individual. However Sang Woo has his own reasons for joining the game due to being heavy in debt as well as his risky bets. Alongside Sang Woo and Ki Hoon is kindhearted immigrant Ali ( Anupam Tripathi) who feels indebted to Sang Woo in particular after helping him countless times, however, Ali hides his own reasons for joining the game also. Together their last close ally is an elderly gentleman No.1 ( Oh Young Soo) who despite seemingly joining the game as a death warrant for his illness, No.1 has a lot more to him as a character than initially meets the eye.

Alongside our main team is seemingly merciless North-Korean defector Kang Sae Byeok ( Jung Ho Yeon), violent gangster Jang Deok Soo( Heo Sung Tae), the foul-mouthed and vocal Han Mi Nyeo ( Kim Joo Ryoung) and sardonic outcast ( introduced not until later episodes) Ji Yeong ( Lee Yoo Mi).

Aside from the actual players there is also police detective Hwang Jun Ho ( Wi Ha Joon) who infiltrates the games as a guard in hope of finding the fate or whereabouts of his missing brother. There were many unexpected twists and turns with characters which will certainly keeps viewers on their feet.

However after the halfway point the screenwriting of ‘ Squid Game’ undeniably hit a slight rut. It wasn’t particularly that suddenly the drama felt slow-placed or lacked logic, but there were multiple occasions where plot moments often felt unexplained or lacked more depth. For example there is a brief subplot involving illegal organ donations of deceased players which whilst wrapped up quickly, questioned a lot about how the guards had established this trade for so long behind the frontman( the head honcho)’s back. Additionally there’s also greater questions about the guards and how they became involved, the VIPS ( aside from some questionable acting), how no one has ratted the existence of the games out and ultimately whether the game operators keep tabs on the surviving winner.

However the drama was undeniably quite profound and heartfelt at times . It wasn’t afraid to present the destruction of childhood and the dog-eat-dog world of South-Korean society. Whilst there were some flaws with the series failing to wrap up certain storylines or character arcs, the cinematography of director Hwang Dong Hyuk’s visionary setting is subtle towards more prominent messages, foreshadowing and hints towards the fate and motives of characters.The OST is composed wonderfully by Jung Jae Il who combines original pieces for the series with traditional Korean and orchestra instruments to create an emotional ambience during scenes. In addition to original pieces several classical music pieces were included with one of the most subtle homages being paid through ‘An der schönen, blauen Donau Op. 134 (Johan Strauss II)’ during several scenes. ( For those who don’t know this piece was also used in the controversial game-changer to the survival game genre, the 2000 Japanese movie ‘ Battle Royale’, which helped to inspire the series and is likely a nod and a wink to the film.) The acting front was admittedly a little wobbly at times but fairly good otherwise . Overall ‘ Squid Game’ is a fairly entertaining watch with prominent messages, intriguing characters and twists which will keep you on the edge of your seats. It is not one for the lighthearted.

Predictable
Contrary to popular beliefs, it wasn't that great. It was predictable and held very little surprise factor. The only surprise factor was the annoying lady didn't get killed for not being picked to play in the couple game being the odd person out. The most annoying character in the series.

I called it on the old man in the first episode. Scenes of people getting killed were repetitive and that reduces the shock and disgust factor. On top of that, the main character is unlikeable. Then again, every character in the series are less than honourable. It's hard to root for useless people. The sad attempt to sell the sad North Korean story line didn't have much of an impact with me. It didn't matter to me as to who lived or die. I just wanted to know how it ends.

The detective story line could have been interesting but the writing was lazy when they revealed who the game master was. Which I also guess who it was when the detective looked through past years' files.

The supposed international VIP brought on another level of 'ick' factor. To think that these people were ""friends"" of the game creator. Birds of a feather right? The acting was so bad it brought down the seriousness of the scene and somewhat came across as a skit.

I felt the ending was stupid. Wasting 1 year was stupid. Dying his hair red was stupid. The whole holier than thou attitude and vowing to hunt down the game makers etc etc was stupid.

On the bright side, it had great cinematography and acting. Kudos on the acting, I really hated ALL of them.

Perhaps this would have been better as a movie.

Biggest new
Squid Game is one of the most exciting series to hit Netflix in some time. It mashes up the carefree, idyllic days of childhood with the brutal realism of adulthood as it forces everyday people to compete in life or death matches in a bid to potentially wipe out their debts. Equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing, it’s a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer. It’s one of the most unique things you’ll watch this year -- and maybe ever.

Amazing show,not just for its story but also it’s popularity…
I didn’t know what to expect when I first started to watch this show,I had ideas in my head of how it could be a Korean version of Alice in borderland(which I love of course-peep the name of my profile) so I was really looking forward to it and some ways it is similar to Alice in borderland but also very different.

Story-
I loved the concept of the show the whole show has a underlying theme on just how far your would go to save yourself and gain wealth,for the players that participate it test there characters and who they are as people,my favorite episode has to be gganbu, reminds a lot of the episode in Alice in borderland where arisu and his friends have to play the big bad wolf game against eachother,it brought out a lot of frustration and almost tears at one point.

Characters- let me just say hoyeon jong (kang sae byeok) was by far and away the best character for me,first moment I noticed her in the train station when she gets bumped into even know you can’t see her face fully,I was more intruiged by her having seen half of her face for the rest of episode,to say that this show was first time she was properly acting is unbelievable,she killed it,and she’s honestly one of the best looking Korean actresses I’ve ever seen, Ali and ji yeong get a special mention too I really enjoyed them in the show because they were to honest decent people.

Negatives-not many things popped out for me but I obviously wanted sae byeok to win so I was pissed off when they decided to blow up all that glass and injure her for no good reason really and then 218 kills her.

Overall/ wether you think this is overhyped nonsense or the best thing to come on Netflix in years this show is now on track to being Netflix’s most popular show EVER,that’s crazy because this show is a kdrama,this show will therefore open the door for so many big shows for korean actresses and actors, I will create so much exposure to the world that korean shows are in fact every bit as good if not better than the likes of stranger things and money heist, Vincenzo and itaewon class just to name the big ones,

My point is this show will be a game changer for the korean industry, I absolutely loved it.

Emotionally captivating, but lacks depth.
Advertised and hyped up as one of the most thrilling survival series, I decided to watch it to see what the fuss was all about. While I enjoyed all the episodes, I have to say, for Korean Drama standards, the plot falls way below expectations. Plus, the bar was set already high for Squid Game as there are well written predecessors of the same genre.

☆ The drama is buoyed by the excellent and admirable performances of the cast, who did a wonderful job portraying the variety of characters. I stuck through for them. But, I did not have anyone that I was particularly fond of or attached to.

☆ The sets were brilliant in a dark manner. The production value of Kdramas rarely disappoint.

Now…

☆ I am definitely among the minority here, but the plot was really lacking, especially since it's a Korean Drama. SG depends on the strengh of it's characters. It attempts to emotionally pull you in. (And it seems to have succeeded, considering the hype.) Out of most of the countries I've watched, Korean Dramas, if given the right script and a good planning, usually produce excellent shows that are highly satisfying, regardless of their one hour long duration. While I understand the intention of letting the horror of the childrens' games in the drama sink deep, the backstory or motive behind the organizers of the game seems to be added almost as an afterthought. Game after game would be going on, but I was interested in only one plot thread involving No. 29 Guard. Ofcourse, they writers chose a trope for several character arcs.
The Games themselves were not intense, but it was the price that had to be paid for failure that was horrible. At one point, I stopped expecting anything different since most of the players made it out purely because of dumb luck or experience. There were some scenes and gore that as @WandeRer mentioned in his review: gratuitous. They served little to no purpose at all or even if I was interested in it, I got no proper explanation. I even felt that some deaths were added on for the sake of shock value.

☆The last three episodes are the ones I enjoyed the least. There seemed to be a sudden twist for one character in particular. Not to mention, some of the explanations were highly unconvincing to me. Maybe the writers are hoping to tie up a few loose threads in the second season. But, I don't know if I'd watch it.


☆ The OST, unfortunately for me, did not do the trick. This might be a result of me not having any particular attachment to any characters, but some scenes that were supposed to rile up intense emotions fell flat. I couldn't get the right 'survival' or 'thrilling' vibes that I was supposed to be feeling. Regular Kdramas such as Flower of Evil or Strangers From Hell managed to pull that in a better way according to me. I was more focussed on guessing who was going to come out alive since many of the actions' by the characters were predictable. All that remained was how long they survived.


☆ I've been seeing people compare it to Imawa No Kuni No Alice, but I see nothing similar among them except for the 'survival game' theme. I've also heard that the script writer was inspired by a few TV shows, one of them being the Liar Game. While I can definitely see the influence, I can't compare any of them since the purpose behind each is entirely different.

☆ Squid Game is not a bad drama. It's a decent watch. Long time watchers of this genre would find nothing new since Survival Games all have their own tropes. I can see that the hype surrounding it is by most people who accidentally stumbled upon KDramas for the first time or are new to this genre.

It all comes down to personal preference at the end. I enjoyed it, but the plot, particularly the last bit, managed to render the drama's build-up to almost nothing. It didn't have enough momentum to tempt me into watching a second season, unfortunately.

Nothing very suprising but that one twist
Honestly ,I have a lot of questions about this series. The entire foundation is on the concept of ""debt"" but once everyone dies and the winner walks out of the game, what about the debt of the dead people? Has no one ever made ANY kind of correlation between SO many people missing ,like 500 of them each game since this game is conducted more than once a year and has been happening for a decade or so. We can deduce this from when the police officer enters the file room and the files are numbered based on the year and there are multiple files for the same year.

If you have seen hunger games, maze runner, divergent,Alice in borderland and the likes, you won't find this very shocking. You know who will win, you will also predict certain twists except for the ONE! So I personally found it dramatic since I have grown numb to the emotional scenes in such series and so had to skip through certain parts. There were parts that I felt were dragged beyond limit .

Coming back to the missing people aspect, how did so many people vanish and the Central intelligence in the country never had an investigation on this? Or not even a conspiracy theory existing on this? Now the reason I focused on the conspiracy theory is that the first time about 100 players left the game, the mc goes to the police narrates his experience and they find it ridiculous. Since he got out anyway, he should've made an attempt to find out about any similar occasions but no, maybe because it isn't the scope of the movie? But he got out AND there is a police trying to find this brother so atleast he(police) should've noticed some pattern around the time his brother vanished and similar other missing cases across country? Why wasn't that pov explored?

Social Commentary on the Intersection of Class and Identity that Loses Sight of Itself
I will start off by saying that user ""Proxy"" wrote the strongest and best-worded review, which entirely captures my feelings on the show start to finish. My additions are brief, but I think relevant:

1. I do not enjoy media that essentially holds up a cue card for me when I am ""supposed"" to feel a certain way; I just like to feel that way because I am so immersed in the story. Squid Game felt like a constant slap with this card, ""Be sad now! Be shocked now!"" and I could never truly experience those emotions.

2. I have a concern that the VIP moment, where he attempts to sexually coerce and assault the undercover officer, perpetuates the stigma that gay men are predators. There is no other gay content in the show--for understandable but unfortunate reasons--so this made me extremely uncomfortable. Given such a popular show is gaining such popularity in areas which are progressive AND conservative socially and politically, and because much of this popularity is occurring through apolitical consumption , I worry what this presents for the (my) gay community. This is a historical issue for gay representation in media, so I hope the reception doesn't follow previous representations of such a stereotype and have real-life consequences for gay people.

The acting was great, but the story lost itself, and the ending was absurdly bad. The show absolutely kept me hostage. Did I enjoy it? Not really. I won't rewatch. I appreciate a user who turned me to Alice in Borderland instead, a death game show which does not at all lose its purpose and has a canon trans character.

Squid Game was worth the one viewing if just for the class commentary and the very solid acting. But that's really it.

Disappointed me more and more as I kept watching
At the beginning, I loved seeing the games that were thrilling and the backstories of the characters (to understand their motivations to participate in the games)
But as episodes went by, I realize that even though the concept is really interesting the story was predictable and the characterization of characters really weak (this character is crazy, this one is a gangster, this one is just really nice etc ... they didn't have more to them then these adjectives)
I eye rolled and sighed out loud at the characters stupid decisions (in the last two episodes especially) so I couldn't care less to what would happen to them
The only good thing for me was the acting, it was awesome!
The creepy music was cool the first time I heard it but ... it's the same one that plays over and over so yeah, got tired of it

At the end, my favorite (actually the only character I liked) was Sae Byeok ❤️

EDIT: okay it was brought to my attention that even the concept of deathly game isn't original ... I would've taken out 0,5 or 1 more stars from my rating if I knew that before watching tbh

Look for the deeper message
- A beautiful allegory on the effects of capitalism. It was so exhilarating that it literally kept me up at night! Some portions seem quite predictable, but i feel that it was on purpose. It is fiction, but a metaphor for real life experiences. Anticipating what may happen next is its beauty because that means it is relatable in some aspects. Given that it ended on a cliffhanger, I am really looking forward to another season.

- The production is absolutely insane. The details, the colors, the music choices, etc. are all spectacular. I applaud the team behind all of the sets!

- The actors did a really great job immersing themselves in their characters. I was really opinionated on all the characters, which is a sign of great acting!

Watch for the games, utterly disappointed !!
U may say I'm cruel or worst for giving this a low rating but I'm writing this based on how i felt overall after finishing the drama. The idea was not original at all, I was reminded of other show like Alice in borderland, liar game, kaiji, as the gods will,... I had watched some other death game show like the above mention and also maze runner, hunger games, the darkest mind, the 5th wave... most didn't remind me of others because their idea and concept were unique. However, what I like the most about these death games is that there is a way to win/survive and not just depends on luck. Sorry to say, I am also someone who like smart MC,..

Story: First of all, the games is simple and the outcome is too predictable. I couldn't feel thrill at all but simply felt nothing and bored while watching....the pacing is too slow (lots of slow motion scenes too). Felt draggy making me feel sleepy...

Too many plot holes to let some characters win easily and for someone who organize the event as serious as a deadly game, the security system is laughable... the north korean girl can easily sneak in a knife!! But doesn't get anywhere with it anyway....I didn't even want to mention how easily the police infiltrate the place. The bad party is way too lenient on the player (or they just too stupid). They say the game are conducted fairly, then they should play the games that will not put disadvantages on women and elderly.

The human trafficking part was unnecessary, it doesn't get anywhere...
The brother reveal was predictable too.
And the VIP?! , TERRIBLE...
The old man motive was lame and I don't get why does he keep asking the MC 'do u still trust people' like why?? They didn't enter the game because they trust people though (they suddenly want to teach us to trust people when the whole drama is them betraying and killing each other??)
And WHAT'S MORE, he's going back into the game trying the save others when he can't even save himself, Hahahhahahaha

Characters: I like none of them, no one I truly root for (maybe abit for the north korean girl). The main guy depends too much on luck (until the end...), whenever he's in trouble/dilemma, there's always someone to help him, he didn't even need to try....There are too many annoying characters (wish they die quickly), many moments that are too dramatic.

Music: It was okay but not memorable... Some part felt unnecessary.

Set design: Colourful, beautiful, creative but maybe the space is a bit limited. But it's amazing how they build it from scratch.

Overall: The only good episode was half of ep 6 (almost cry..), This drama focus more on characterization which maybe why it doesn't click with me cause I personally prefer game more than character.
Going into this drama with high expectations after seeing the trailer but also worried because it's a kdrama (there's bound to be too much drama), haizz...my worry was right...

People may disagree with me but this is my opinion and my preference, if u have a good time watching, I'm happy for u!!

Sentimental, not strategic.
I hated that the show highlighted the sentimental aspect and not the games. Besides the 3rd game, the other games were lame and anti-climatic with so little strategy. If you plan to watch this because of the strategic aspect of the games, lower your expectations.
The only saving grace of the show was Wi Ha Joon's character, but alas look how that turned out... a cliffhanger plothole, literally.

*Spoilers below*
I also hated that MC, I wish Park Hae Soo's character would be the MC instead. The MC is a goody-two shoes but has no sense of reality at all. He returns back into the game knowing that people were gonna die but he is still nice to everyone, even till the end he thinks they can win without people dying. I wished they removed the whole segment where they all left the game because that episode just made the series draggy for me and made me think the MC has no sense of reality. There has to be a second season or that ending would be tragically terrible.

I don't really think I can write something about it. It was really, really intense, but I will try to write as much passive as I can.
The story is nothing new, is a type of Hunger Games more or less, the plot even the whole building of the characters and their relationships. But actually it is a analogy to our world, where a lot of people believe that they can step in the bodies of others to succeed and they do it. But in the end, if you are poor, you have to stay like that and the rich dectate your life... Maybe this is my own interpretation. This analogy, this absolutely crazy story is trying, with the most horific way, to tell that this isn't the solution. Even if you step on everyone, this system is designed for you to fail or to became on of them.

Ok, in the more prominent staff. Exceptional shots, photography, scenery (the colourful stairs, oh my god). And also amazing music and acting. At last, I really don't think it needs a season 2 (nothing official, just the way it ends it surely gives that vide). Some stories need a final end. And it is enough. But, with all this success (do you know how huge is for a k-drama be no1 in Greece? Here, they don't even acknowledge BTS' success), I'm almost sure they will continue. And I really, really don't want that.

Brilliantly Brutal
""Squid Game"" is a tough watch. Really tough. If you don't like extreme violence, or seeing blood, this drama is not for you. What I loved about ""Squid Game"" is that it isn't just mindless violence. In this case, the violence is important to the story, and the story is much more than the brutality of all of the games. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I will avoid talking about the games specifically, but the childish and cutesy presentation of each game juxtaposed to how anxiety-filled and traumatizing they were is definitely a highlight of this season, and probably the main reason for its popularity. It is definitely what initially sucked me in, but it was the characters that kept me watching.

The main lead is Lee Jung Jae as Seong Gi Hoon (or #456). We get to know him as a likable screwup with a gambling problem and a divorced father of a young daughter. He is easy to root for from the start even when his choices are frustrating. I love that through him we can see how good people can make bad, damaging, and even selfish decisions, and it helps that he is extremely relatable. He is approached by Gong Yoo in a brilliant cameo that leads to him joining these mysterious games.

The games are where we meet the majority of the rest of the cast. They are a random group of people desperate for money that we soon learn to love and hate. Yes, many of the players are the equivalent of the ""red shirts"" on Star Trek, but there are also many memorable players. Besides the obvious leads like Park Hae Soo as Cho Sang Woo (#218), Gi Hoon's childhood friend now turned desperate failed small-town success, or Jung Ho Yeon as Kang Sae Byeok (#67), North Korean refugee turned master thief, there are quite a few characters that stand out and kept me invested while watching. I absolutely loved Anupam Tripathi as Ali Abdul (#199) and Oh Young Soo as older and wiser Oh Il Nam (#1). I think of them as the main squid-squad.

I do think the thug characters were a bit stereotypical but also well played. especially the dynamic between #101 & #212. Of course, I can't forget Wi Ha Joon as Officer Hwang Joon, who I also liked and I appreciated that on his obligatory quest for the truth he didn't make many silly decisions, and was clever instead of going for the too emotionally invested to be smart trope. Then there is Lee Yoo Mi as #240 who is another amazing standout player. The only characters that were bad... really bad... were the spectators. Their scenes were so long for the acting was so terrible. Distractingly terrible. I know English-speaking characters in KDramas are usually pretty bad but I wish for such significant roles that they could have been better.

Would I watch this again? Definitely, and that's saying a lot considering the extreme violence. It's insanely popular for a reason, and I'm sure I will pick up things I missed when watching it again. I am also curious about watching the dubbed version (Which I never do normally). There are a few times when the script's pace slows, but being such a short series it's easy to just binge watch in a day or two. I was intrigued and engaged the whole time and only took a break from watching when the episodes became more emotional (episode 6 had me ugly crying), but was also my favorite episode. There are also countless theories to explore to keep you viewing some things very differently.

The suspense is consistent throughout this drama, even if some parts of the story felt stronger than other parts. There was one major plot twist that I expected from the beginning, and another that took me by surprise until the moment it was revealed, but either way, it was entertaining watching how it would all be revealed. I do wish they gave it a more definitive ending than just leaving it open-ended, possibly for a season 2, or maybe just to keep us thinking. The lack of a neat ending made it a more haunting story which works too. You can definitely say that the plot isn't perfectly neat, or even completely original... (you know the comparisons already ""Hunger Games""...""Battle Royale""...""As God Wills""...), but the execution of the plot (No pun intended lol) is where it excels. Just the idea of us watching the games just like the VIP observers in the show is very meta and disturbing. This drama is disturbing.

Overall, ""Squid Game"" is a great dystopian spin on capitalism and greed, and human nature/survival instincts. I love stories that explore the good and bad of humanity, and this takes those questions to the extreme. I also love stories that make the viewer question what they would do if the stakes were extremely high, and that's where this drama more than succeeds. Plus it's visually iconic. The sweatsuits, the guards, the giant girl at the tree, those stairs... so many images are now permanently a part of pop culture because of the brilliant direction. I'll never look at shapes the same way again!

I still don't quite understand how you play the Squid Game... it looked kinda like full contact hopscotch gone sumo on a mini baseball field lol! Now that I think about it, children's games can get pretty rough! But I do know that as far as dramas that live up to the #1 on Netflix hype goes, this one definitely wins a spot on my KDrama favorites list!

Highly captivating with great acting
I loved this drama so much. It's realistic in that no one is portrayed as a villain nor a hero. It acknowledges the injustices in the world and tries to depict several realities and personalities. It is a drama that covered several bases as I was just as invested in the game plot as I was in the backstories of the characters. There were definitely a few plot lines that were left unresolved but apart from that, the story, visuals, and acting were all superb. Definitely a great drama for non k-drama fans, as seen by the worldwide craze.

What was all the hype about? ** SPOILERS **
DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED


I'd been waiting to watch squid game for a while whilst I watched other dramas and due to how popular it is, I thought it'd be worth a watch. I was quite wrong, as this is the worst rating I have ever given a kdrama. I actually thought the first few episodes were brilliant, I liked the style of the show and it seemed the the plot was meticulously planned out and had somewhere to go. I also really enjoyed the acting in this, I think it's the best part of the show. However there were major drawbacks that made it almost unwatchable after episode six.

SPOILERS


So, I did like how we got a backstory to some of the characters and why they decided to take part in the game, however I think they should've shortened it right down so that they could include more characters and also so that it gave no indication as to who were going to make it through and win, because Gihun was the main focus. I just didn't like that there were so many deaths that added absolutely nothing to the plot and it made me so frustrated throughout, like the death of Kang Saebyeok, Jang Deok-su and Ha Mi-nyeo, also Ali's death made me mad but it did make more sense to the plot than the others. We never get an explanation as to who the staff are in pink and why they are partaking in the games. The police officer's death was annoying as he could've led to further plot development and a different angle, but all the work he did was for nothing and getting to know him from the start made absolutely no sense to me, as he died uneventfully anyway. The information he finds was half explained at best. I don't understand why they introduced the VIPs with those stupid masks, it made it almost unbearable to watch with cringe, it would've been a better idea to say the guy with the man did it because he was evil, sick and twisted. We have absolutely no idea to who the guy is who plays the games at the train station, whom we believe we will get an explanation for from the beginning. Apart from Kang Saebyeok, the other main characters' morals kept switching and it really annoyed me. One minute they were throwing their teammates off the bridge and the next they were sacrificing themselves. It made me mad that the whole reason saebyeok had to survive was because her friend gave up her life for her, but she died needlessly, whereas it was okay Gihun survived because the old man did as well, but it turned out not to be true. Don't even get me started on how cheap the so called ""plot twist"" with Il-nam was, it just ruined Gihun's character development and the best answer the could come up with is that it was ""for fun"". Didn't make any sense to me.

All in all, I thought the music and the acting was good and the actual idea was there, it just needed refining. Apart from that it was a step away from unwatchable and I wouldn't put myself through it again. However I'm sure if this was someone's first kdrama, they would like it. Sorry if I didn't make any sense or sounded a bit ranty, it's my first review :)))

Unpopular opinion: Overhyped (great start,poor ending)
When life becomes a game, brings out the scariest ride of life. This has a fascinating story line not new but still it's captivating games relating to childhood is really interesting.

Good points :The starting is really great showing people economic condition so that we feel bad for them and showing pity to have us emotionally bonded, that's great. It's didn't look forced

The production design is great. The cinematography and ambience created is spot on for me. The actors all stood out in their characters specially grandfather character, cop and that wild girl haha.

Twist: The participants can choose to quit and participate again if they want was kind of surprising totally not expected.

Bad points: See this is not a new story line where character participate in game and dies when they cannot complete task.
Like #CUBE and #ESCAPE ROOM they have done before. So ,it was kind of similar nothing really unexpected happen.

The ending, it sucks. The last episode was boring felt disconnected from other episodes. Of course , a setup for next season but really do we need it?

Definitely, there are loop holes if thought carefully like how that grandfather character can be in two places at the time of VIP thing and no one notice a contestant being missed?

But, at the end of the day, this show shouldn't be missed.

""Do you still have trust in people?""
People and their values. Even better: people and their greed.
Squid game was a very anticipated Netflix series. The trailer is phenomenal, the cast eye-catching. I mean, we have Gong Yoo and Lee Byung Hun as guests. Where do I sign up?

The game-style show reminds me of Liar Game. Except that with more money, more contestants, and more brutal deaths.
Even though this game is everything except righteous, we cannot forget that every individual was given a choice. Several times. People wanted it. The main character included. So to blame the creator of the game for your own decision to participate is true hypocrisy. That is one of the reasons why I hate Seong Ki Hoon. He is an awful person and an even worse father. I´m not saying that we´re supposed to like him. But it sure felt that the writer wanted us to.

""You don´t trust people because they´re trustworthy. It´s because you have nothing else to lean on."" Yes. I hate Ki Hoon, but he knew what he was saying. People are selfish and greedy. If you want a concrete example, just look at the sexist Garden of Eden men. Someone supposedly faithful to his religion who prays and prays but only when it suits him. He also uses religion to justify his sexism and allow him to have a better chance to win the prize money. And at last, what outraged me the most. While praying, he thanks the people who died and allowed him to win as if they made that option. Well, I can guarantee him that didn´t die for him.

Three good people played the game: Sae Byeok, Ali and Ji Young. The rest, pure scum. Like most of us. Me, writing this and you, reading it. I don´t intend to offend anyone, but unless you´re 100% sure that you´re as selfless, innocent, kind-hearted, and naive as they are, don´t pretend to feel hurt.

Overall, I enjoyed this series quite a lot. There were some obvious gaps that I would love to see filled. These gaps of information make me believe there will be a second season. If so, I look forward to it.

Overrated, just watch Liar Game. Here's my rant...
YeaH... this was pretty overrated. The production, cinematography was great but... The ""VIPs""... omg their dialogue was soO cringe. These are some fake a$$ rich ppl if I've ever seen any. LoL.

The motivation behind why the game came to be? Yeah not very convincing...

Also, was pretty disappointed that there were soO many predictable moments. Especially with the old man doing a ""Jigsaw"".

And what happened to the daughter? Was the Gi Hoon soO depressed that he just gave up on her even though she was the damn reason he went back to the game?!

It seems that they set up the beginnings for season 2... But with the foundation being season 1, I seriously can't imagine watching.

Omg one more thing, when Gi Hoon was having a serious heart-to-heart dialogue with Ali... Wtf was that sh!t? LoL. Conversation literally was:

Gi Hoon: ""So why are you here?""
Ali: ""Money""
Ali:""What about you?""
Gi Hoon: ""Money""

Well damn.

I sure hope so, cause this ain't no slumber partY.
D:

Sorry this was much less a review and more of a rant. But I can't help it. It just— it could have been soO good. It could have beenN something. But it wasn't. And that to me, is maddeninG.

Please abandon ship and don't make a season 2 lol.

This is my first time writing a review I felt that the cinematography was amazing i loved the contrast with the the content of the show which had a lot of gore and the light background with the games that had light colors, overall the acting and music was great i just really hate the main character I expected some sort of development from him character wise it felt like he only won in the end out of luck he didn't really earn that money, this is someone who literally signed away his physical rights the loan sharks were going to take his organs and they most likely were not going to do it in a hospital so after or maybe during the process of the organ harvesting he could die he was in mortal danger and yet he didn't take that seriously even his diabetic mother wasn't enough to motivate him were it not for his childhood friend killing himself he wanted them to quit together and then what were they going to do financial wise, I felt like that didn't make any sense the writers wanted him to be a 'good' person a little too much most of the other main characters were willing to do whatever it took to survive and he just wasn't the same.

So, squid games.

I've taken a lot of time thinking what to write on it. Everyone who has watched it has absolutely loved it.
I absolutely understand the hype-the cast, the cinematography and the directing deserves the appreciation.

In the beginning, it absolutely hooks you. The games, the adrenaline rush, human dying in a wink.

The sneak peak into the background of the characters contributed so much into the understanding of the different characters and their reasons for doing the things they do during the game.
The relationships they forged, the various games, the music; everything was going well...
Until.

Until it fizzled out.
It could have done with 6-7 episodes with more compact writing - after episode 6, it went downhill for me.
1. The reasoning behind the game was unconvincing and washed out. (Maybe the fact that after episode 6, I knew who was the mastermind, it took away the shock element and the surprise that I should have felt).

2. What was the purpose of the inspector? (Yes, I do know he will be in the next season), but what was his purpose in this season?
The reunion with his brother, again, didn't surprise me. Was the reunion supposed to be surprising? Or was Lee Byung Hun playing the brother supposed to be surprising. I felt that it was latter.

3. Gi hoon's characterisation was a bit flat for my liking. He was afterall -a son who'd not hesitate to steal and gamble and an irresponsible father and I don't know when he developed a moral compass!!
There is also this glorification of GH and vilification of SW that i have seen around and I do not agree with.
Maybe it was intended, maybe not.

Having said all, I would be eager to watch a season 2 of it, to see where it all culminates.

And I'd like to know the secret of the inspector's phone. The battery lasted hella long.
Mine drains out after 12 hours!

Welcome to a roller coaster ride of emotions
Before moving onto the drama I would like to ask a question that --Is KINDNESS reciprocated in this world or is it not? I would like to ask again that Is KINDNESS reciprocated in this world or is it not? Let's talk about this at the end of the review .

Now coming back to the drama it was a roller coaster ride of 9 great episodes which contains the truth about a human nature. This drama tells us what we humans are capable off for the sake of money. How we can even go as far as killing and betraying someone we know for money. This is human nature.The only thing that is protecting us are those kind souls. Who even at the face of death helps someone else.

The story builds up in a way that helps the viewers understand the situation someone is ready to put their lives on the line. It tells us how our everyday life can be more of a hell than the real hell itself. And how the poor don't have the choice but to put their lives on the line to survive.

The cast of this drama did a pretty excellent job. They brought their characters to life.Jung Ho Yeon was outstanding in this drama in the way she portrayed Kang Sae Byeok. I loved her character. Also Lee Jung Jae nailed his character.

Now coming back to the question i asked earlier Is KINDNESS reciprocated in this world or is it not?
So the answer to my question is KINDNESS can be reciprocated back depending upon the person. It is reciprocated by another kind heart person. And through that we keep on living.

REALLY shocking! REALLY visual! REALLY bloody!
Ever been in a bad position in life, where you didn't see any exit? Now imagine that one person approaching you, offering you the solution to all your of problems if you just play that simple kids game with them. Would you accept?
Well, in the series of Squid Game hundreds of people did, but it took a brutal turn.

Carrying a lot of responsibility, the actors and actresses of Squid Game do a hella convincing job. Every little emotion gets recreated at such a detailed level, that makes it easy for the viewer to take part in the fictional world. Furthermore the frustrated, desperate, crazy actions of the different characters, especially in the critical, dangerous and stressful situations, seem truly realistic, which makes the overall experience more frightening.
In addition to that, definitely a few of the plots caught me off guard!! I don't want to spoiler anything here so I keep myself quiet, but I bet YOU can't foresee a lot there, since integrating unexpected spins in the story is that well executed in this series.
The music adds a lot of contrast and support here and there, improving the atmosphere a lot!
Well, at last but definitely not least I L O V E D the character and relationship development. The interactions and background stories were astonishing. When I started watching the series I didn't expect those ups and downs, turns and twists. Moreover seeing the characters grow with their challenges creates kind of a bond between viewer and the individuals, thus the spctator gets more involved in the story.

All in all: recommended , but definitely a heavy one. Not quite for sensitive people.

Great but slightly over-hyped
Squid Game is like the BTS of K-Dramas - very good, definitely up there in the top league but not really justified to be so much more hyped than others.

Sometimes we can't really explain why a piece of pop culture gets such attention from the masses - probably a mix of good timing and sheer luck. Because objectively, there isn't really any novelty about Squid Game. Don't get me wrong, it's a good drama. But the plot isn't all that shocking and surprising, if you've seen works like ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Alice in Borderland"". The cinematography is good but doesn't stand out like it does in other popular dramas, such as ""Goblin"", ""Crash-landing on you"" and ""Kingdom"". The OST is forgettable - the only songs I remember are classical music pieces and not original compositions. The acting is great, but again, not any more outstanding than in other dramas.
But let's look into it in some more detail.

Plot
The story is exciting, no doubt. It is fast-paced for the most part and when it slows down, we are given background stories that help us understand and sympathize with the characters. The pacing is generally done well. I have seen many people talk about how shocking this show was, but maybe I have seen too many violent movies and series, but nothing about Squid Game really shocked me - except maybe the unexpected sex scene in a K-Drama.

Acting
The cast did an amazing job bringing these characters to life. To be fair, Jung Ho Yeon did not have to show that much range, since her character usually wore the same closed-off expression. But I'm sure she will further impress us in future roles. My favorite discovery from Squid Game was Anupam Tripathi. His Ali was simply adorable and pretty much everyone's favorite character. I also really enjoyed Kim Joo Ryeong's performance. She really knows how to do crazy.

Writing
I really liked the villains. There are the obvious villains but there are also one or two that will take you a bit longer to spot.

What I liked least about the drama though, were the ""VIP""s. First of all, I know we all like to fall back on stereotypes. And God knows there is plenty of Western media with Asian characters being stereotypical caricatures. But did they really have to paint the only white characters as brainless, sex-crazed geezers? (Not to mention they even pulled out the predatory gay trope.) Don't even get me started on how abysmally bad these American actors were. This being a Netflix production, did they really not have the means to fly in some decent actors who won't over-enunciate every single word?
The revelation of who these VIPs are was also quite underwhelming. I got excited when they were first mentioned. Who could it be? Politicians? Celebrities? Maybe even someone one of the characters would know? Surprise, it's just a bunch of depraved foreigners.
And then there's the issue that their extensive screentime seriously messed with the pace of the plot. During the last two episodes these foreign VIPs were constantly explaining and commenting on what was happening in the game, which took the thrill out of the otherwise high-paced plot and also raised all kinds of ""show don't tell"" red flags for me. The fact that they were such bad actors made the experience even more jarring.

In conclusion, it was a really good drama up until the last two episodes, where the VIPs kinda ruined it for me.

SQUID GAME IS OVERHYPED !!!
okay listen, I watched it as my Bus Drama when I was on my way to work and home and really can't say that I understand the big hype around this Drama. I just watched it only to understand why everyone was like "" THE BEST DRAMA EVER"" around me and I couldn't find the Reason at all. It had a few good Scenes like the Doll Game or the Cliff Scene but the rest was just unnecessary slaughter. I love Thriller and Psychodrama but this one was without any point. There are way better Drama out there like maybe "" Devil Judge"" or ""Rugal"" and for me, it really doesn't need a Second Season ?

Works because capitalism doesn't
I want to start off by saying that this is more a think piece than a legit critique of the show. You don't need me to tell you that this show is good, you've probably heard that before. But in case you want to hear me say it again: Yes it's good. It's fantastic.

I discovered my love for Korean cinema with Bong Joon-ho. So mý approach to Koreas movies and dramas has always been a political one and it's what I appreciate most about this country's media.
This is on every level a more than competent show, acting, writing, cinematography-wise. But its brilliancy lies in its portrayal of the struggles of the working class.

Squid Game is not subtle with its portrayal and criticism of South Korea’s economy. The entire competition as shown in the show is held by the elites, who watch poor people killing each other for entertainment. The super-rich organizers have become so detached from everything, that the suffering of regular working-class people has become funny for them. We see rich men enjoying expensive whiskey and making jokes while the people in front of them are dying. The participants of the game are no longer human to them, in fact it gets literally said out loud, that they bet on them like they’re horses. It starts with them only getting referred to by numbers. And with each game, the players get more and more de-humanized, more and more alienated. The competition and brutality is what the game thrives on. It’s why the organizers deliberately give the participants less food, to “weed out the weaker ones”.
But there is more subtext to Squid Game, which makes it so brilliant. None of the contestants have been “forced” to play. Unlike in titles with similar premises the characters are here according to their free will. In fact, after the first game, they vote whether they want to continue the games, and the majority votes for no. And yet they still return. Because they have nothing out there waiting for them. In the real world, they have no real, tangible opportunity, to earn the money they need to restore their life, but in this brutal competition, they do. They can turn the cash down. They can leave the competition. But as participant Mi-nyeo beautifully puts it: “It’s just as bad out there as it is in here.” And that’s the thing, no one is forced to take part in this- and yet they are. Because their circumstances leave them no choice. Because partaking in capitalism is not a free choice, it’s the illusion of free choice. They’re playing a game of survival, no matter if they’re in the real world or in the game. But here at least, winning seems more realistic.

The harsh reality of capitalism also plays a big role in multiple backstories of our leads. Gi-hun, our protagonist, is unable to get back on his two feet after losing his job. Not only that but he is also traumatized after watching a friend and colleague die through police brutality at a strike.
We have Ali Abdul, an exploited Pakistani immigrant, who basically has no rights as a worker in Korea, since he’s there illegally. Kang Sae-byeok also fled to the South half-island from the North hoping for a better life, but finds herself disillusioned and trapped in poverty. The players of the competition can only exist because of capitalism. They are not unique and unlikely cases but part of a structural problem.

The idea behind the games is to give the participants one last fair chance to success. The frontman says out loud, that he wants a fair competition. In the real world the players of the game have been discriminated, based on their social status, based on their gender, based on ethnicity. But in this game where they play seemingly arbitrary games, everyone is supposed to have equal chances.
But do they?
Even though every single player could, in theory, make it through the majority of the games unscathed, how high their chances are is almost entirely based on circumstances that pretty much are out of their control.
Just like in Squid Game, whoever gets the advantages in life is based in arbitrary factors. In which family or country, we are born in as well as dumb luck. It's the meritocracy lie, the lie of the American dream gamified. Haven’t we all been reassured time and time again, by the 1%, that our system is fair and just, even though it clearly isn’t? The prize money is just hanging there, barely unattainable yet sufficiently close enough to see it and we keep telling ourselves, that we will get there if we push ourselves just enough.

Then there are the guards of the competition, dressed in menacing red robs. Though it’s easy to hate them since we constantly see them actively taking the lives of players on screen, there is subtlety in their portrayal, showing that they too simply are clogs in a machine with basically zero autonomy. Aside from, you know, constant murder, their schedule reminded me of that of an average warehouse employee. Their schedule is tight and strict and they’re not allowed to ask questions. A disembodied voice tells them what to do, when to eat or sleep, not all that different from the schedule of an Amazon warehouse worker.

In an environment as brutal and bloody as the one in Squid Game, kindness is a privilege that is impossible to afford. To make it through, you have to play dirty. Everyone who is kind and trusting by nature, like fan-favorite Ali, gets crossed. Many people have stated, that Squid Game makes a thesis of human nature.
But Squid Game isn’t as much about human nature as it is about the circumstances our players are put in. Except for a few exceptions, like the over-the-top evil mafia boss and his goons, the participants are neither good nor evil, they’re desperate. And they want to survive. It simply shows what happens to people who have nothing to lose.
Our hero doesn’t get as far as he does because he is kind, or because he is witty, but based on luck and technicalities. But his soft heart is the reason why he is left a broken man, unwilling to even touch his prize money. Humans aren’t good or evil by nature, but you won’t make it to the top through honest work or good character.

Korea isn't the thriving capitalist utopia that we imagine it to be. Korea's economic growth lies on the exploited working class, which works an average of 52 hours per week. In comparison to other countries, unions are weak. Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International have consistently denounced the situation of workers. Kang Sea-Byeok, the Korea from North Korea in the Series, was hoping for a better life in the South. But when asked if that wish came true, she simply stays quiet. Kang Sae-byeoks story is not an unrealistic one. Many North Korean refugees live as second-class citizens. Forever strangers living in a country that speaks the same language as their homeland.

The fates of Gi-hun, Ali etc. are familiar to many Koreans, but claiming that Squid Game’s scenario is only applicable to Korea, would be a false deduction. Many American critics have now taken it upon themselves to praise Squid Game for its portrayal of South Korean workers specifically. Fact is, that Squid Game works because capitalism has failed everywhere it’s been tried. It’s certainly not a coincidence that the two Korean pieces of media that have reached the biggest global success are both deeply anti-capitalist.
One of the elites in the show watching the competition live, states that South Korea's games are the best ones, in a throw-away line, implying that South Korea isn’t the only country that organizes games like this one. Meaning that, in the world of Squid Game, what we see on screen is supposed to be happening all around the world.
It’s one of the most telling lines of the show. Explaining Squid Game’s success despite all its cultural differences is simple: We all speak the same language under capitalism.

Contrary to popular opinion
Yep I dropped it. Why? Well, it became kind of dull, same ol same ol concept of greed, betrayal, lies and murder.

The concept of playing games for money, being manipulated by a bunch of rich dudes with nothing better to do is nothing new. Sort of like a rich man’s sport. Some reviewers found the background stories of each character interesting, but I was just skipping through to get to the good stuff :)

I liked the Tug Of War game, at least it had a good strategy and concept instead of the normal thinking of Big and Strong is better. The deaths, killing and piles of bodies were just a bit too disturbing for me. Just a tad lol.

At least it’s not your typical Kdrama with crying and slapstick humour. :) Quite similar to Hunger Games if you can stomach it.

The finish is not up to the mark!!
The start was so exciting and the story was going good. Each game way shown very well and was waiting to know what would the next game be. Till 8th episode everything was going well but in the last episode many things are still mystery What happens to Hwang Joon Ho (the police officer) and what happens to his brother Hwang In Ho (Front man)? And what was the reason he became a front man? Who was continuing to conduct the games? These questions remains un answered even though the drama ended. This ending is not what I was excepting. The expectations were high from episode 1 but the last episode was not satisfactory.....

Overhyped
Look, I really liked visuals, bright and recognizable costumes, colourful design, cute ost, but the story is nothing special. Whining about capitalism first episodes was too excessive, but i held on and the middle part was quite interesting despite it being too dragged out, but the ending just killed it off completely.
I am that kind of person who never skips any part of movie and I like different arthouse movies with camera being settled down for indefinitive period of time, but this show really challenged me. Especially the ending, god, I just literally skipped it. Such a disappointment.
It was ok to watch it once, but if you saw ""13 tzameti"", ""The platform"", ""Cube"" or ""Battle royale"" then Squid game won't surprise you at all, you would just easily guess the next moves and mysterious characters and after completing the show you would feel like just wasting 485 minutes of your life.

ironic, symbolic, nittygritty and overboard
the acting here was great, Jung Ho Yeon as a rookie was a great addition, I'll look forward to her upcoming work

tbh, the games were simple, though it looks good on paper, it actually was boring. I get the irony of making people kill or be killed with child games, but having seen things like the genius, the hunger games and saw, the child games were, child games

their ""twists"" as well were meh. I did see behind the black mask right away, though there were a few ""oh"" moments even when the expected happened but it still made me ""oh""

like the final 2 deaths.. tbh it seems unfit for people who joined a game to cold heartedly kill others, end up killing themselves so close to the end
I actually thought Sang Woo was going to try and kill Gi Hoon again

the old man, lol right until I saw his name on the last card I was wondering why not only an old man went in, but why make an old man character. to gain sympathy on the ml. to hurt him when the old guy does?
sadly that was what Sae Byeok was about ;(

this was not revolutionary or even that entertaining but still it was somewhat ""different"", not that different from alice in borederland, saw and hunger games but it felt new enough
I wouldn't mind watching a 2nd season though I mean what can 1 dude do against an army of rich people with an even bigger army of gunners

I did enjoy the cameos, I feel like usually ""big"" names like to either go in for a short guest role for funnies or well not give up a main role, but lee byung hun and goongyoon were somewhat key characters . though I wonder if LBH actually played the whole thing or did he just come during the reveals xD

ALSO, what happened to poor joonho! and his messages?!

A Grim Game Of Greed: Play Or Skip?

Trigger Warning: blood, death, gore, gunshots, physical assault, burning, NSFW, flashing lights, graphic imagery, hanging


The recent Netflix hit Squid Game is a thrilling, and emotionally layered survival series which plays off the idea of free will, economic disparity and privilege and turns it into a grim game of greed.

The whole thing starts with when someone offers a desperate man the chance to play a child's game of flip the card and wager on the outcome. As that offer escalates, it turns out that more than 450 other desperate, immensely debt-loaded people have been lured into a similar brutal contest, where they’re playing popular childhood playground games for the chance to win 45.6 billion Korean won (about $39 million), only if they manage to eliminate all the contestants and be the last person standing.

All the nine episodes take place in present-day Korea, and the players are invited who are on the margins of society. It seems like the entire game could very well be secretly undergoing with none the wiser. Recent Korean cine stories like Parasite and Itaewon Class have adeptly addressed wealth inequality and class struggle in real-world circumstances, rather than through the lenses of American fantasies like The Hunger Games and Elysium. Film director Hwang Dong-hyuk (known for My Father, The Crucible) follows this trend with Squid Game, his first drama series. In spite of unrealistic elements, the show seems to have been designed to convey that our present reality can be just as hellish as any imagined world.

The script is a ticking clock that will glue you to the screen as shows of this genre should do by constantly making the audience question ""what would I do in that situation?"". The whole point of shows like this is to become extremely relatable. Despite the cold violence, gore, and blood, the story does not lack all the emotional impact that it's supposed to generate. The haunting score by Parasite composer Jung Jae-IL only adds to this constant terror and suspense.

However, I could not help but feel disappointed by the final leg of the series. In episode six, which is a total emotional stunner, it feels the series has reached its summit plot-wise but then suddenly veers into unsatisfying and predictable story decisions, with quite a number of glaring plot holes. The last three episodes seems highly underwhelming in terms of intensity and insight of the earlier ones.

Thankfully, everything else appears to be immersive and brilliant. Beautiful scoring, enchanting set design, and immaculate visuals are some of the ingredients that will keep you hooked. Along with exceptional performances from a remarkable ensemble. The personality changes that Ki-hoon (played by Lee Jung-jae) goes through is an acting masterclass. Other notable work from actors came from Anupam Tripathi, Wi Ha-Joon, Oh Young-soo, Kim Joo-ryoung, and Lee Byung-hun. Although, Gong Yoo's cameo acts as the cherry on the top. His brief appearance both in the pilot and the finale episode acts as a captivating device as well as a friendly reminder to our Goblin ahjussi.

Squid Game grips you through 9 episodes that are realistic enough but watching it is uncomfortable and is certainly not for everyone. Keeping the multiple trigger warnings in mind, the show should not be viewed by both kids under 15 and adults undergoing mental health issues as some scenes can get quite traumatic. The drama is tempting to fast-forward, either to skip the gore, or to bypass the sense of dread when the show stretches out some of the lethal rounds. While the discomfort could be written off as the price of admission for watching a deadly game, it really affirms our own humanity. The fact that this show has become an overnight global phenomenon both seems like an irony and a sad reality.

More Than Just a Game
Squid Game was something I was looking forward to post Devil Game. I enjoy thrillers with an edge that offer social commentary and it doesn't disappoint. I think that is why it resonates so much with American audiences. The games: convened by bored rich people at the expense of the desperate ordinary people trying to get by, some for noble reasons, all at the end of their rope; are supposedly a great leveler, offering a way out that is an equal opportunity. Inequity is a hot button topic everywhere, but here income inequality has grown so grea tly that we have situations where some people die for want of medical care while others are killing for amusement. This could be happening right now for all we know.

They quickly find out that it's more than money on the line, and yet such is their desperation that they continue forward, despite knowing that every game is whittling down the players, some of whom have formed alliances with and become bonded to in that way that only survivors of trauma can.

We learn about the characters of the individuals playing the games in bits and pieces by the choices they make, flashes of backstory and when they occasionally share some information with someone else. You have an incomplete picture for some people the entire time, while you can see some clearly from the beginning. Others you discover facets of their character only in extremis.

This makes for GRIPPING viewing. I was so grateful Netflix put up all episodes at once so I was able to binge watch it over 2 days. Mostly one day, and the finale the next morning. I just couldn't stop once I got started, it's that compelling.

Some shows you have to force yourself to finish, others you have wait for weekly releases, some you even savor every slowly released episode knowing that it brings you closer to the end and you just don't want that to happen. (Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha is like that.) But this one, just plan to let yourself watch as many episodes back to back as you can.

I've seen some people commenting on an extremely brief scene that takes place in a bathroom during a sexual interlude. Both people are clothed as far as the camera can see, the bulk of the content in the sequence is dialogue, and it just seems ridiculous to me to object to such a minor sexual setting in a series that has about 8 -9 straight hours of extreme violence. But heads up, please watch that part and don't skip it, it's important to the story. Apparently some people were so offended they skipped it. Perhaps they were underage or something.

Great premise and thought-provoking convrsations
Boy does this show know how to keep you watching! I'm gonna be honest, after finishing Devil Judge I didn't think any other drama this year would impress me but someone recommended this show to me and I decided to give it a watch. Great decision really. I had so many questions and the main ones weren't really answered until towards the end of the series. The format for the show is not new, but for Korea's take on ""The Hunger Games,"" this show did not disappoint. Actually I will say this show is better than The Hunger Games. There.

The premise is enough to make you watch the first episode but the great performances from the actors and the intriguing feel of the show is what pushed you to finish-and all the unanswered questions.This show had a lot to say and I feel it touched on a few interesting themes. It was really interesting to me how the show was full of characters that are deemed dirty in Korean society. It was quite refreshing since the kdrama landscape is always full of chaebol type shows that tell the stories of Korea’s top 1%. Not to mention all the subtle comments about people and society that are scattered throughout the conversations of the characters and scenarios of the games. Some scenes just really make you think.

The characters were really great. Sure there were more compelling characters than others, but everyone was so fleshed out you actually ended up liking everyone, including the less favorable characters like Mi-Nyeo or Deok-Su.

Overall I think this was an amazing show. Sure it’s not perfect. and some things were left unknown purposefully perhaps. However this show was just really well made, from the actors to the art design to the script. Truly a phenomenal show. I strongly believe that this show lives up to every ounce of hype it is getting and it deserves all the attention it’s getting. Especially the actors. I hope that in season two there are still so many mysteries regarding The Front Man and his past. I wouldn’t be mad if a prequel regarding his time in the games was a thing. I also wanna know more about The VIPs and how they come to work for the leader. Not to mention the ambiguous ending. Given the way things went towards the end I definitely think there will be a next season. 10/10.

I wish I could give more stars to this series, but it’s a huge no. 6,5 is more than enough to this silly what-they-called-game!

Why?

Here’s my opinion:

From the second episode I tried to guess every detail about what could happen in every episode, and all (like every one of them) of the guessing are correct. :(
Oh man, that’s not funny. I was thinking “should I continue watch this series?” and yet, here I am writing this review.

Another biggest problem that occurred to this series was the acting of some characters that really annoyed me every time they talked.

Strong Start, predictable end!
So I watched this show because I wanted to watch smth similar to Alice In Borderland And Die Now, and I watched this. I'll try not to give spoilers and just write generally.

Watched the trailer, gave me alot of expectations but I wasn't disappointed. First few eps are really good, but then towards the middle and end it kinda stops your hype. It's like, you'll be able to predict what happens next. Now alot of people compared this show to Alice in borderland. I'll tell you what's the difference. Alice In Borderland plays with your mind, you'll be playing with the characters and trying to solve with them which makes it quite interesting. SG games are also good, but you'll just figure it out quickly.

Acting wise is good. All of the actors have done a good job. So i think that's ok.

For me, i think i expected alot after watching AIB and Die Now (chinese drama, really good. If you have time do check it out) But ig that hype died down as i was watching further eps. If this is your first time in this kind of genre or if you just want to watch it, go for it. This show is not all bad, you might be disappointed at some parts but overall its good. But personally for me, Japan will always take the cake for this types of genre.

Hope you have a great time watching!

Should have skipped the whole thing
Let's start with what's positive about this series: the individual stories of some of the desperate folks, who end up in the slaughterhouse (e.g. the North Korean defector, the woman ready to to anything to survive, the girl giving up her life hoping to contribute to save someone else, ...).
The rest is utter trash. I was fooled by the trailer. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.
I hope there is no series 2 (not for me, since I won't watch it anyway, but for the poor souls, who might).

Awfully Beautiful
Squid Game, as fun as it sounds, is a masterpiece created in the pits of Hell. The combination of utterly incredible screenplay and outstanding acting performance makes one go through a number of emotions within its run time. Not only does this drama show us the most beautiful direction of photography, color grading and overall aesthetic that is quite frankly, an eye candy, but it also paints us an honest image of an immensely massive gap between the rich and the poor, how the ""lower class"" can easily be turned into nothing but puppets for the pure entertainment of the rich.
Personally, I would 100% recommend this show to anyone that is seeking to spend days while being extremely mad about the cartoonish nightmare we call life.

Please Include Cha Eunwoo in Season 2!
Liar Game and Alice in borderland have greater Strategical Depth compared to Squid Game but Squid Game stands out in Cinematography just like most Korean shows in Netflix. I hope they will add a genius player next time which is really a player. I really enjoyed it nonetheless.

Add more antiheroes next time . Add more interesting characters and focus on their dark/boring lives and how the game will change them. Focus on character development.

Please include Im Siwan or Cha Eunwoo next Season. I love to see my favorite actors.

Cool concept and weak ending
It really reminded me of one of my favorite King books The Long Walk (I wont go into details). The start was really strong and imo the first game was the coolest. After it got a heavy Black Mirror vibe. Oberall it has a good concept and I was tottaly fascinated with the scenery. Later into the series I started finding a lot of undlogical and sometimes funny moments.

How far are you willing to go to satisfy your dreams
The concept of the drama is nothing new, but the team did a great job in executing this drama to almost a perfection. Even though some parts of the drama was somewhat predictable there were some great twists and turns too. There were games to play and mysteries to uncover. And there was also the heartwarming or heartbreaking backstories and interactions to balance the whole thing. What is one willing to do survive? How much is one willing to change in times of crisis? And who or what were controlling things behind the scenes? The story progressed very smoothly with no dragging and flashbacks to slow it down.
The atmosphere created in the drama along with the somewhat childish but eerie music was a huge part of the drama. The attention to details was a pretty good touch from the production team. The casts were very good and did an amazing job in my opinion.
Overall it was very refreshing and fun to watch. If you don't mind some gores and deaths in drama then it is one of the best dramas of the year for sure.

Poor and Greed can distort a human.

When my significant other told me: Hey, Squid game top number one ranking in US on Netflix. I was like, okay let’s watch it.
Now, having heard mix reviews that It is plagiarized from Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but since I have not watched any of those mentioned, I tune in with the least expectation, though knowing dark theme is unavoidable.
After more than 9 hours of cursing, screaming, and hiding inside my blanket, here is my review:

The story begins with Gi Hoon, a man hit his low end due to some failed business decisions, in bad debt, leaching off his mother’s bank account , gambling days by days and cab barely afford finance for him and his daughter.

Then one day, he was chosen to play the game in which he could win millions of dollars.
There were 456 players selected to play 6 rounds of game which resembled childhood game; however, the difference is that if one makes mistake or luck is not with him, he/ she would end with brutal death.


Each main character had their backstories and reasons for entering the game. None was righteous nor skillful, in the end they need to take all desperate measurements in order survive.

This is Netflix original series and thus the quality production is top notched. The casting is phenomenal, and I’m very impressed and surprised with model turns actress Jung Ho Yeon. Her acting is raw and real and you wouldn’t know this is her first debut series. Wowww, such a talent..
There are also two big cameos Gong Yoo and Lee Byung Hun. Their appearances only few minutes on screen; however, their exceptional acting really elevate the series to another level.

What I do not like is the character of Gi Hoon, it’s unconvincing and unrealistic to me for him to make a turn at the end. Also the twist of the master behind the game and the reasons
is just plain boring and predictable.
Overall, Hwang Dong Hyuk has successfully conveyed his message to the audiences: this society is full of unfairness and divided, there are the poor struggling to live while the rich, after meeting their physical needs, what made them happy is nothing but toying with the lowest class.

The drama is very good but not excellent, I didn't find a story or script in the subject
The series is about group ofpeople and these people are either poor or have debts that they cannot bury, so an organization run by rich people decides to play with the feelings of those people and drag them behind their need for money.
These people are taken to un island where survival games begin
These games are childhood games that were played pin Korea in the past, if you lose in them, you will be executed
In the series, you can expect what will happen, especially when you know the game, you will know how the events will unfold
This drama show the dark side of the people, and they can do everything for surviving even killing each other, or frind betray his friend, killing people with cold blood
Play with them like they are nothing
This is really sad to see humans do things like that ...

For me, the series was fun, but there is no story in it, like I am watching some kind of entertainment TV show
It's not the best Korean drama i see...... there is a lot of Korean or Chinese drama are amazing than it

Worst TV show/drama I ever watched
Seriously, this was the worst show I have ever seen, and I have seen some terrible shows from a variety of different countries.
I got hounded to watch this crap, and it was overrated garbage.

A plot full of holes, sprinkled with a superficial level of capitalism/economic disparity theme, frosted with terrible yelling-talking-acting for no real reason.., and when you bite in there is no substance.

I would say I am avoiding spoilers, but there is no plot to spoil. Do main characters of shows or movies usually die? So you can guess the ending. Games were stupid (and the organizers didn't even consistently follow their own rules) and lacked tension, it never built characters beyond a basic trope, so I did not care when they died and thus the show had no tension.

Story: It was boring and full of plot holes. 1
Acting: CAPS MODE ON! Hollow characters, cheesy cast and theme of the VIP.
Music: I only remember one song and it was crap so 1.
Rewatch: Please no.

I have seen school film projects with better acting and more entertainment value than this.

You are fully entitled to like whatever garbage you choose so if you liked this then cool, but if you've not wasted time watching this, then pick something better.

A Somehow Refreshingly Cliched Twist on the Battle Royal Trope
I never imagined my first review on this site would be for Squid Game.

I've been a fan of the battle royale trope for as long as I can remember. Battle Royale, the Hunger Games, Alice in Borderland, all are my favorites. I first came across Squid Game through Netflix's Youtube channel and expected to dislike it - at the time, the trailer looked childish with its colorful uniforms and funky looking game regulators with shapes on their helmets. Nevertheless, it stayed on my to watch list, and as the days passed, so did its position on the Netflix Global Top 10 charts. I decided to give it a go.

THE GOOD
What made this drama compelling was its non post-apocalyptic setting, something I'm used to in battle royale, as well as the games. Utilizing games from cherished childhood memories as modes of death was an eerily fresh take. I found the majority vote as a means to an end creative as well, leaving the illusion of choice to both the characters and to us the audience. It's true that actual participation isn't ""forced"", rather, the preexisting circumstances of each character made the reward money all the more incentivizing. I loved its economic class commentary, moral ambiguity, as well as cinematographic ties to art pieces. Visual artists and fans of thriller like me will definitely enjoy.

THE OK
I found myself persuaded by the acting despite being impartial to the screenwriting. I don't know if this was on purpose, but Gi-hun's face was quite punchable at times. Maybe it was an attempt to portray his gullibility? Not sure, but actor Lee Jung Jae did as well as he could balancing the pathetic yet sympathetic role. I was impressed by Jung Hoyeon's role as Kang Saebyeok (though I'm a little biased since she's been one of my favorite models <3) especially since the idol/model to actress pipeline is so saturated. I wasn't expecting much though. Objectively speaking, her microexpressions really allowed 067's vulnerability to shine through. Stoic characters are surprisingly hard to portray - I'll remember hers for quite a while. Wi Ha Joon makes a pretty officer, but other than a look into the ""villain"" side of the story, he wasn't offered much substance. Park Hae Soo's role as Sangwoo was memorable and convincing! I kept expecting him to be more morally gray so being caught off guard was pleasant.


THE BAD
This is where I feel most conflicted. Certain deaths were highly predictable just based on screen time and backstory alone. Unfortunately the screenwriting left little room for emotional connection. Sure, deaths were sad, but most of the time they were empty since I barely knew anything about the characters. Halfway through the show the games started to lose meaning. I even think one of them towards the end wasn't a children's game? I was left hoping for something more strategy-based or just a little more depth. Killing occuring outside the games added another level of chaos, as did the small game regulators' scenes, impacting the pacing negatively. The screenwriter didn't do the best job with the masked leaders either; choosing familiarity destroys suspense if not done well, and unfortunately that was the case here for me since I guessed correctly. 9 episodes was not enough. It's obvious to me that this many loose ends means a preplanned second season, which I'm not too enthusiastic about considering the sloppiness towards the end.

In conclusion:
Did I love this show conceptually? Very much yes. Would I recommend watching it? Still, yes, please give it a shot. Do I think it's worth the hype/critical acclaim its been receiving? Not exactly, but it's a major move for a Korean show so I'll celebrate that.

Regardless, Squid Game has left a lasting impression.

Deserved the 'Starting Hype'
While I wouldn't say it's in my 'Top 10' of all time, I can say that Squid Game, unlike many other series, managed to deliver in it's hype which it had received since day one, providing top-notch production quality, sensational acting and character development, alongside a concept that was extremely interesting. One of the key things here, the character development, worked perfectly with the story theme: the fact that, in face of money, even your best friend can become your worst enemy if you need to survive etc.

Casting choices were absolutely perfect, and while I was the tiniest bit disappointed with the direction of the final episode (funnily enough the same sort of feeling I had with one of Lee Jung Jae's previous projects known as Chief of Staff) - I understand why it was done.

One other thing I really like about Squid Game is how easy it was to watch. I normally am not interested in re-watching dramas, but with Squid Game, I don't think that's the case - even when I know who survives and who doesn't. Two words: great writing. Here's another four words: check Squid Game out.

Lofty intention but the story writing was not strong enough to truly deliver anything memorable.
It's too serious and preachy to be enjoyable. There is no one to root for. No favs. No OST to make me cry. No love story to make me smile. No jokes. Moral of the story: humans are greedy, people are willing to do a lot of bad things to get what they want when they are pushed into a corner. There is a lot of luck involved in our life outcomes. Gi hun going back? Doesn't even make sense. He barely scraped through the games. lol
The ending is like when you get a meal you have been anticipating then the meal is just average. It's Meh...

Good Enough
Korean Drama ""Squid Game"" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful.

It has a nice cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action scenes. The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more 'Korean Drama' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.

Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.

So, overall, 7 out of 10.

started better than it ended .. a shame
ok so i tried to go into watching this with no expectations but was hard due to the hype it was getting , but regardless i gave it a watch and i did really enjoy it at first , however towards the final few episodes it started to lose its momentum - for me personally. i think the final episode was awful tbh… i hate how the police guy was just killed by his bro with no explanations, his story was acc the most interesting tbh but they wasted a good opportunity with his storyline, also i hate how ali was made to be so gullible in the show, altho maybe im biased since he was my fave character. none of the plot - except the old man’s connection to the game - surprised me at all , i never felt i was on the edge of my seat unsure of what will happen next cuz its all pretty obvious , regardless it was a nice watch and it does deserve to be given such a great attention, just a shame how rushed the ending seemed , i understand the ending dont get me wrong, i just think it sucked lol

anyways, the acting was incredible though! it made me keep going regardless of the boringish plot

Here’s What You’re Not Missing, spoiler Alert: Nothing New
I normally take many months or years before I review shows and movies. This peculiar routine has allowed me to objectively think and analyze shows better. Although it's only been a few months, I can't help but want to either save someone from wasting their time or help someone discovers what will soon be one of their favourite shows.

Squid Game is a thought-provoking television show on the one hand. It was all around made with wonderful cinematography, frequent violence, occasional sexually explicit, and contains a caustic caricature of income inequity.
On the other hand, it is a widely used theme across the world. Wealthy and privileged people play games with the lives of those who are less fortunate. You can definitely see it as catering to its audience's twisted inner child. The vividly coloured, massive playground (both theoretically and literally). I didn't find anything remotely fresh and innovative in this plot.
The show tried too hard and failed horribly to persuade its viewers that everyone is evil simultaneously  ( the wealthy gamblers and/or the less fortunate players). As I previously indicated, it attempted to shed light on a topic that we have all encountered and are all too familiar with: when their lives and money are on the line, all human beings become morally corrupt barbarians.

Despite the large ensemble, the premise is glaringly obvious and plain. And the failed comedic portions about the terrible billionaires who come to wager on the game have the personality and dialogues I would come up with as an elementary student when imagining the lives of the top 1 per cent—blatantly laughable and unrealistic. The drama attempted to be more meaningful than it was. It tried desperately to squeeze the viewer's perceptions of individuals and circumstances into overused cliches—restricting itself with its inane jargon, particularly at the climax.
In its attempts at distorting and layering the audience's perception of characters, only around five or six characters were developed decently out of hundreds. The rest of the hundred could have led to great possibilities but they simply remained as food for powder. At first, you may think that some characters appear to be well-developed, but you'll easily find them inexpensive pawns for conveying the drama's fundamental theme.
An example of that being, the covert police officer plot feeling unessential. I will give it the positive recognition of it being thrilling in its own particular manner. However, his only purpose in the drama is to give the audience a peek of the cruelty that goes on behind the scenes. His sole purpose, in the end, was to provide the audience with an inexpensive perspective to look through.

In conclusion, it's a show you should only watch once if you've run out of things to watch. Although director Hwang Dong-hyuk has announced a season 2, I might watch it if it contains a different cast, but it's not necessary. It was terrifying, but not in the conventional sense of a Korean drama that delves into philosophy and morality. Like justice and equality.
If a show that supposedly wishes to contain true philosophical, psychological, and morality v.s. values themes, that show must challenge me in all those aspects and mentally as well as emotionally. That being said, Squid Game definitely did not do any of that. As my last attempt at holding a candlelit for this disastrous show, I will watch the second season and form an opinion that is un-bias and not affected by my opinions of this season.
My final words to you as an audience is to watch at your own risk. You'll either gain dissatisfaction or attain satisfaction.

A+ Set Design
I'm not wild about the story - it's a relatively straightforward ""murder game"" take, though I think for me one of the most interesting elements plot wise is the pseudo informed consent of the participants. A lot of murder game takes - from Most Dangerous Game to Battle Royale - have unwilling participants. But these participants (barring the ones in the first game who did not entirely know the stakes) continued to play willingly. In fact, that seemed to be part of the point.

There's no particular reason to stress the anti-capitalist messaging in this. If you have read anything about Squid Game it's probably about that. It's interesting, but also to an extent deeply nihilistic in a way that I find a bit unengaging. while accurate, hopelessness in the face of death like experiences just feels....pointless. I know that I'm likely to go bankrupt if I suddenly get cancer, and I know that there are people who have so much money that they could easily wipe my debts but instead build a (probably fictional) massive murder island so they can sit on human furniture and take bets on whether I'll off myself after she dies. Bleak af.

For me, the thing that stands out the most about Squid Game is the set design. There's a real story in the way that each of the sets is designed from the bright yellow piggy bank floating like a light in a casino above the room to the childrens's school yard at the end. The performances - specifically newcomer Jung Ho-yeon - were also really solid.

Very engaging, but disappointing ending.
I have to say the strongest parts of this drama are the acting and writing. There are some great performances by the talented ensemble cast and the writing is very good with a few minor implausibilities. The drama is fast paced and keeps you at the edge of your seat. You grow to care for the characters and feel for them when they face tragedies. There are some strong messages of compassion and responsibility for your fellow man in the face of the most horrifying circumstances and how those circumstances changes the contestants for good or evil.

The drama seemed to be going in a good direction, but suddenly derailed with some plot twists that changed the perceptions I had already formed based on the previous episodes. I felt disappointed and manipulated. ML seemed to have a split personality. He was irresponsible and apathetic in the outside world, while compassionate and protective in the game. The over the top violence and gore may not be suitable for some viewers.. I guess it adds a certain sensationalism to the drama and attracts younger viewers given its Hunger Games qualities.

Guest performances by Lee Byung Hun and Gong Yoo give the show an even greater star power and their performances notable, albeit small. I wouldn't be surprised if this show has a second season. The last episode seems to set it up that way. However, I am not sure wether I want to continue on with this story based on its wrap up.

Good for its genre, weak ending!
It is definitely overrated but the actors are good, the production quality is high enough and especially the middle episodes are very stressful and anxiety-inducing, which is the exact goal of this show. The 'lessons' are very on-the-nose but ultimately - very real. Some of the characters are very very well-written and well-acted and you wish you could be with them a bit longer than you actually are.

If you like survival-style shows, definitely watch this! at least that way you'll know what everyone else is talking about it! Especially all the memes lmao.

Brutal survival game that represents how hungry the society for money
For a super trending series, I tend to lose interest watching it (just my personal thing) but a lot of my friends keep recommending this one for me so I ended up watching the show too late that I've been exposed to a lot of spoilers from social media, that somehow affects my enjoyment from watching. I've seen a lot of the same kind of genre and Squid Game is a ""just fine"" drama, not that great but also not that bad.

Money, the root cause of why the players gathered in one place. The show explicit fairness and honestly in the game rule, which is something new for a survival-of-the-fittest environment. Except for the first game, it was a big surprise to the players that elimination brings death to them. It was unfair for those who died in the first game because they had no idea that they will end up killing from participating in the game. Unlike those who chose to comeback even after witnessing too many people that has been killed in front of their eyes. This shows how such people will be unethical in times of needs. They're afraid of being killed but they're also afraid of living life with too much debt. Personally speaking, if I'm one of those lucky player who survived the first game, I don't want to return obviously but I have a different life situation than with those characters who chooses to return. Good thing that they highlight the reason of the main characters on being in the game.

The bad thing about the series is that they let players kill each other outside the game. It isn't just fair for those who lacks physical power to fight back, and also a will to kill a person. It is really hard for me to watch such brutality presented in it. I also read some of the feedback that they disappointed with the ending. I kind of agree with them because the show really started as an absolute shock but during the last few episode, the tense are keeping lower and lower.

Anyways, the show deserves the recognition from the viewers. My favorite yet most painful part of the story is during the marble game. I cried for the sacrifice, I cried for witnessing betrayal, and I cried for losing someone's precious life by playing a child's game.

Decent entertainment.
It's competent in most aspects.
The hype honestly makes it a worse experience, because you expect something mindblowing and genre breaking.
It's not that.
It's Battle Royale Fall Guys.
It's mostly enjoyable. The social commentary is a bit heavy handed at times, but it's nice to have it there.
It's not that original, it's not perfect.
It's fine.

(random note: The scenes with English speaking foreigners were hilarious. The writing was mostly ok, but it didn't come off as entirely natural. And combined with not-stellar acting it felt odd. I guess like Asian scenes feel in western movies maybe.)

My Humble Thoughts (Pls Don't Cancel Me For Lowkey Hating On It XD)
Squid's Game
Rate: 7
Keep in mind that before you read any further, this review is coming from the perspective of a person who's seen far too many psychologicals for his own good, as an experienced viewer on this certain genre I carry a bias for how dramas like these are executed. I'll try to keep this review as less biased as I can but I'm already sugarcoating it with the rating so I won't be going easy on this either lol.

To keep it simple, if you have experience watching dramas similar to the genre in squid's, at most it'll be meh for you. Overall, the games aren't as sadistic or brutal as you'd want them to be thus leaving you with an empty feeling. The pace for the starting episodes is pretty slow and I'd go as far as to say episode 2 as a whole is skippable as it's not crucial to understanding the plot. Episode 4 was squid's peak and sadly the episodes that follow do not keep the consistency flowing. The plot twists for the most part are predictable and the ending doesn't fully answer all the questions that are presented as it teases a possible opening for season 2.

As for people that are new to this genre and who are just looking to jump onto the hype train, I'd say you'll find it enjoyable for the most part since it's your first time diving onto a drama like this. Anywayysss, regardless if you're experienced or new, I'd recommend to give it's first four episodes a chance to see if you'll like it.

Korean Hunger Games which reflect today society
Watch this series due to the hype. Overall it's good to watch, even though for me I already can guess the ""bad"" guy earlier.
Episode 1 is quite boring with slow pace and the introduction of characters, etc. Afterwards the pace is quite ok.
But actually for this type of genre the suspense is not really there, not something that make you glued to the screen, maybe because it's similar to hunger game, so the surprise elements is not really there. Sometimes it's just too ""lucky"" and hard to believe, like how easy for a policeman to sneak in, can survive hiding for few days (no foods and drinks?) and the main role always win easily, especially when he licked the sugar candy and during first game when he about to fall.
The good thing about this Korean version is the moral of the story or maybe the background story on why people are easily blinded by money, and the lost of morality in our society which is kinda true... In our current society, people tend to be selfish and don't care of others, will use any means to reach their own goal.
Acting wise, thumbs up to all the actors and actresses !
Overall, this series is still worth watching, but not up to the hype. And be prepare of some bloody scene for those with not so strong heart to see blood

This reminds me of Maze Runner but in Money Heist X P.E Class costumes
I thought it would be interesting from start to end but nah I was wrong.
I thought it would be very new and different from other k-thriller dramas but nah I was wrong again. It is actually a clever idea to combine two phenomenal movies' ideas into 1 drama, and the idea of using childhood games as the main focus here is insane. I never thought child's games could be this dangerous. Set aside the clever idea, I personally hate the ""blood"" they're using, it looks too fake.
To be honest...
I really loved the overall drama...at first, but I lost bit by bit of my interest after the 1st half of the total episodes. As the episodes went on, this drama felt ordinary and bland. I became numb seeing their fighting and killing scenes, it happened too often and became boring (not to mention the ridiculous blood they're using, too watery!). I expect this drama to be different but it turns out as one of Netflix's typical k-crime action thriller drama with a hanging ending and lots of untold truth. Maybe there'd be S2? that'd be good, I'm not that interested tho.
Conclusion: that's okay, just give it a go, it's exciting.
Last but not least, WI HA JOON I LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK!

A brilliant show fully worth watching
This is a show that is simultaneously brutal and beautiful in its depiction and execution. It's a fantastic metaphor for capitalism and the illusion of autonomy, the compulsion to survive that drives the poorest when their supposed freedoms and choices are constrained by a need to survive. Anyone could have left the game but out in the real world, the pressures would not let them. So they stayed and played.

I thought Gi-Hun was a weak and unsympathetic character, I didn't like the actor's constipated expressions at everything and I thought the support cast was better in terms of sympathetic characters and acting. The plot itself was formulaic but still great. Lot of the deaths were foreshadowed but that often made the prelude thick with emotional suspense and a desperation to be proven wrong. The games were brutal and I thought in particular that episodes 4 and 7 were masterful.

Again, I felt let down by the main character and I also found everything on the side with the undercover policeman to be an unnecessary addition which could instead have been devoted to fleshing out the back stories of some of the other characters. I found the North Korean defector (sorry i can't remember her name) the most interesting whilst Ali and the old man were the most endearing. This show really though could only be endured if you hated the characters. As soon as you began liking someone, they were bound to die.

Stupid game yet powerful
I wasn't interested to watch even tho I am big fan of thiller because I have watched same kind game drama 10+ times. I could easily tell who is the villian and plots ?
For me the show clearly stole by old men and Kang Sea/ Ho Yeon
I would say 3 ladies were instersting they were so distinct to eachother yet different morals from eachother . They have their own flaw finally thiller drama who did justice to women character in thiller otherwise they aren't given no character progress, character development and their distinct choices . I love that they were different from eachother one knew to sacrifice another revenge another just wanted to win . Kang Sea clearly is eye catching from the start from her acting to character
Although I am happy she didn't win as that would make devil too. No character were good here they all have devil inside them a good person could never have win the show . The old men stole shows from start to end. He was in every part of it yet distinct . I remember first time when he try to convince that guy. I knew it things were never coinsidence here . Yeah it has Eposide 9 only, there gonna be plot wholes Especially if you watch the show once only . I love that these types of drama are creating distinct fanbase in Kdrama as k- drama/series is being global
Dear Old men and Ho yeon if you don't win awards I am gonna be real pissed . Hope to see her in new dramas in future someone take her with that short hair girl in drama why they have so good chemistry like I forgot she was gonna die instead rooting for them . Their chemistry is the best part . They remind me of some GL manga now I am gonna watch their fan edits to satisfy myself as I didn't see both of them dying ??

Before I get into the irate rant from hell I have bubbling within me -- let's start from the top.

I love this show. I can't even try to deny that. I started it out of curiosity because I kept seeing so many people talking about it and once I started, the storyline and acting kept me hooked.

Okay scratch that. I can't go through this in order. I'm mad as hell. I mean I could chew bricks at this point. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ENDING?!?! I am so pissed off Gi-Hun won. Sorry, but I am. In what world did I ever think he would grow brains and actually think about others? I mean even in the games, he tended to just hide behind people to never get his hands dirty. I don't blame him. It was a good strategy even if he didn't mean it. But he is a coward. From trying to take advantage of a old man to blaming everyone for the outcome.
I honestly had hoped that once he left he would have at least followed up on his promises to not only those 2 people but to his daughter as well. But would you look at that. A year later and still looks and acts like a bum.
Like I try to think yeah what he went through was traumatic but how can you promise people that you'll take care of their families... and then not? Even at the very end end he didn't do what he said he would. Wow, okay, he got the kid out and homed him with the old lady and left the money there... I'm just like what the hell? She's probably going to try to turn it over to the police. Lol As what about finding the kids mom? Why bother promising that if you didn't plan too?
I'm sorry. I'm just pissed. Even at the end when we find out there is going to be a season 2 and he is saying ""how can you do this to people"" -- like they didn't give then a choice? They all went through the first game and left. Guess what... they all (most) came back, did they not? The choice was ALWAYS there, no one just took it again. How can you blame them for the other people's greed? Lol Were you not there too? That makes you just as greedy. I can't stand people like this. They want to put the blame on everyone else while trying to make themselves a hero. It pisses me off. I didn't want him to win honestly. I really wish Sae Byeok had won. I SAID WHAT I SAID!!!!

So if we completely bypass the pos he really is and focus on the other aspects of this show... holy hell there is so much I'll never be able to think of innocently again. Lol RIP kids games. XD
I really do look forward to season 2 though. Mostly to see how Byung Hun and Ha Joon turn out. mostly because I feel like Ha Joon is still somewhere if you know what I mean.
And I mean come on, any chance I have at seeing Gong Yoo you know i'ma take it. I hope he is in season 2 with more parts. Lol


I realize this review is 99% pissed off and complaining and 1% of me all over the place. I'll probably come back to this once I have calmed down and add more to it because I know this show is really good. They all just played their parts all to well that I feel like my head might explode. Lol

Mind you, I know not everyone will agree with what I have to say and that's great. Just don't dump your complaints on my review lol they have a spot where you can write your own review. :p

An okay drama for its length, but not more than that.
First things first, I can’t help but compare this to Alice in Borderland, because that was the first of this genre of show I ever saw. While there are definitely differences, and both shows are good enough to watch them and still make a separate impression, for me AiB takes the cake in the “deadly/survival games”-genre. I think maybe I would’ve enjoyed Squid Game more if I hadn’t watched AiB first, because it set a bar that Squid Game just couldn’t reach.

Now, this review isn’t about AiB, so let’s talk about Squid Game. I think the biggest problem with this show was I had a lot less empathy towards the characters. I didn’t care much about their story, and some of them just felt a bit unfinished and flat to me. I wish we saw more background of some of the main characters. The show was pretty short, but I think it could’ve done with a flashback here and there of the characters pre-game. Some characters were okay, but most of the characters just didn’t seem to understand their actions and decisions have consequences. Consequences they knew about. I will say, the main actors did great though, which was one of the saving graces of the show.

There were also just some disruptive scenes that were just so awkward to watch due to their dialogue. Sometimes I was really immersed in the show, but then there were a couple of scenes that were just so cringy that completely took me out of it. There weren’t too many but I still think the show could’ve done without.

The games themselves were really thought out and I liked that most about the show. But the games themselves, and their result didn’t leave as much of an impression on me due to the characters being so lacklustre.

I think the first few episodes were pretty good, but let’s just say I was glad the final two episodes were only 80 minutes combined in total.

What I did love though were the set design, costume design and background music. Both were so good, quite childlike to fit with the games, but at the same time eerie, to fit with the theme of the show. It really tied everything together.

Overall, I think this is worth trying it out, but only if you’re into this genre. I think it’s mainly worth it because it is so short, so you won’t throw away too much if your time if you end up not enjoying it. That being said, I can’t see myself rewatching this anytime soon.

the plot and cast are great. this show might be the best in 2021 (so far) and it is also the best action-thriller. even better than taxi driver or penthouse. the soundtrack is mostly instrumentals and there are not many with singers singing but it also gives that bone-chilling feeling as if u are there yourself. what I will say for the rewatch value is that if u have a strong stomach and if u are used to watching shows like this, then go ahead. but overall is a 10/10 for me. but also do keep in mind that this show contains a high amount of violence and gore. so, if you're underage, u might want to try other dramas with lesser violence.

trust me and watch it, it’s literally number 1 around the whole world right now that’s such a big deal!! The first kdrama to ever be first!! Watch it, it’s honestly amazing!! The cast is outstanding and they play they’re roles so well. With just 9 episodes I went through so many emotions, it’s a must watch! If you’re thinking “I’ll watch this later” or “it doesn’t sound that good” still watch it! I promise you you’re going to love it. One of my favourite dramas!! *REPEATING SAME THING*

Pretty interesting
First of all, I would like to mention that it was a good watch for a drama with 9 episodes. Honestly, I'm pretty confused about the ending but other than that the story was pretty suspenseful with a lot of violence and had its sad or emotional scenes (which may or may not wrench your heart).

The acting was really good so kudos to all the actors. The music wasn't anything memorable, it was just enough to create some sorta suspense. The storyline was quite confusing with the revelations and I think I need some explanations from other people so that I can understand better.

While it did fail to wrap up everything, it isn't that bad and pretty much depends on your taste whether you would like it or not so check out the synopsis and content rating then give it a watch! (Please check the trigger warnings then decide whether to watch it or not)

I love how Koreans are stepping up their game with their unique new ideas in dramas
First of all I wanna say:I LOVED IT

I wanna start by talking about how the vibe and sets of the drama were bright and colorful but the story was dark and bloody, this made the drama more creepy and interesting and fun to watch I really liked this about the drama and I think this is what made it different from “Alice in borderland” which people said is similar to this drama
The story:
Well as I said in the headline I LOVE how Koreans are getting more and more creative with their dramas, not only in terms of story but also the camera work ,the sets, the fashion (and in this drama it’s not exactly fashion but the customs), anyways the plot is really good I don’t think I got bored any moment watching it, one of the things that I think about when watching a drama is what messages does it say, what did the writer want us to conclude from watching this and I think this drama has really great messages and experiences to learn from

The acting:
The acting is amazing every single actor did his role excellently, and since I didn’t see many people praising our ml gi hoon I wanna say he’s one of the main reasons that made this drama fun to watch his acting is natural he portrayed the character of a kind and a simple civilian so well and I could feel his emotions too, all the acting was brilliant but those who stood out to me were: firstly our sae byeok that got so much recognition because of her role and still I can’t believe that is her debut, secondly joon ho the police officer I think this is my first time seeing him acting but definitely he shined so much to the point where I am watching his other works now, and Ali’s character which is also most people’s favorite he was such a lovely add to the cast

Rewatch? I’m not a rewatch kind of person especially for a drama that definitely needs a season two, but for those who like to rewatch I think you’ll rewatch this since every episode has so much going on and so much details to realize and analyze, and also that at end of the drama your perspective will some kind of change so it’ll be fun to watch again with that new perspective

Overall I highly recommend to watch this, it’s definitely worth your time, it’s also only 9 episodes but still with a good experience and entertainment.. so give it a go!

MY FAVE SHOW OF 2021
Squid Game is an action survival drama that captivates you from the very beginning to the end. It has successfully put me back on the murder/thriller dramas again (yay!) after being stuck watching a lot of romance lately. I haven’t binged a show in so long, but I was binging this show for 3 days. And if I didn’t have any responsibilities I probably would have binged it in one sitting.
Squid Game has had such a positive impact on the Korean film industry after being crowned #1 on Netflix. So many people I know who have shown no interest in foreign films are now intrigued by this unique story. Everywhere I go someone is talking about Squid Game!
Before you think “Oh it’s overly hyped and it just has some big names,” let me tell you THE HYPE IS DESERVED. A lot of people watching it right now are just “following the hype”, but if that’s what it takes to watch this masterpiece then so be it.
The show really makes it hard for you to trust some of the characters and leaves you on the edge of your seat constantly! The acting and music used to portray the unsettling nature of the games really did the trick. It used the classic “happy music playing while people are getting murdered” trope a lot.
I will say though, even though the ending was a MAJOR PLOT TWIST, it was kinda weak. It didn’t really make sense to me. I found the birth of the game being really dumb, but I mean humans are dumb so what do I expect...BUT, the ending was able to skillfully portray people's greed for money and the lack of sympathy that some people of wealth have.
I do believe there will be a season 2 because the last episode leaves you thinking “What’s going to happen now?”. And by the looks of the charts and popularity, Netflix will surely bring this hit back.
Overall, it is totally worth the hype if you want a binge worthy show and want to be creeped out at 2am in the morning.

Brutal, bloody, beautifull yet probably overhyped..
This drama was awful to watch but has pretty high entertainment value, some parts where good, others mediocre, it did leave me guessing (some theories where right others wrong) and did keep me on my toes at times. It does have some interesting issues and does make you feel stuff... but not to much. And it definitely did leave room for more seasons as well as had me closing my eyes a lot. It is utterly brutal in some scenes that did both gross me out and just made me feel pain... a lot of pain, impressive painful pain.

What ups the score for this otherwise pretty okay but not worth the hype drama is the beautiful combination of brutality and childrens games with extremely well (mis)fitted OST, something that I personally am a complete sucker for and the fact that my very picky and hard to get to watch K-dramas with husband said it was the best K-drama he had seen. the visuals here are just stunning (unless they are gross) and the contrast is just so good and hits all the right spots for me. I also liked to hate most of the characters and did enjoy some great (dark) humor and one liners from some of the contestants.

So this is not something for the faint hearted but for those of you with a somewhat bloody darkside this may just hit the spot. Just don´t get to attached to anyone....

Love-hate relationship
One of the most important elements to a successful drama is how satisfying /fulfilling the ending is.

It's not about what we might think is fair but what makes us exhale in ease at the end feeling it's finally wrapped and tucked nicely in our memory.

That wasn't the case here.

-We follow an mc who is very poor, very in debt, has an ill mother and a lonely daughter who will be taken away from him forever if he doesn't do anything.

None of that gets even remotely solved! Zero!

-We grew to know and love characters like Saebyeok and her scattered family and her last hope to bring them together.

Again, NOTHING CHANGES!
*well except a very very weak last minute forced scene that had no absolute value!

- We're introduced to a police officer who we expect to be the end of this organization. But guess what he adds to the story?
Right, NOTHING!

We, as viewers, are attached to these characters, feeling what they feel. We, and them, endured the horrors of the game bc of a purpose. We wanted them to achieve their goals, we wanted to see them happy at last. or at the very least for something to change!!

But to make all of these stories and characters and games and twists and emotional manipulation to keep everything exactly the way it is, is just weak writing in my opinion.

Even if they were planning on a season 2 from the start, (which I really hope so, for their sake. Otherwise this was the worst drama ending I've ever seen) they should've made it a little more (or any) satisfying to the viewers. They sacrificed the ending for s1 to build for a s2. But even that was very poorly written and executed.

The drama was great in the beginning, amazing even. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time, binging episode after another in anticipation. That's why I can't give it a lower rating.

All was great until the last two episodes or the last one really. It left me confused, mad and disappointed. And all I could think was ""wth did I just watch?""

So good..but so many questions!
Having watched one episode of Alice in Borderland and not watching that again, Squid Game hooked me in with the interesting plot of debt, desperateness, and weird masked people in suits.

The more you watch, the more hooked you will get. Each episode has different games, in addition to new discoveries. I never had a drama that had me cry this hard before, but this one did it. You also really need to analyze every scene as the director/writer/whoever planted a lot of tiny details in this, which is amazing.

The big letdown for me was definitely the last episode. Ending an amazing show is tough. I didn't expect a happy ending, but I expected a better last episode that answered some questions. So much is still left unanswered, and the ending didn't really hook me in like ""Hey, watch season 2 to find out!""

Still a good show, and worth the hype. Every actor did an amazing job.

An innovative concept, but finished a bit hastily
Squid Game had one of the best concepts, with mystery around few people who participates in a game with millions to win. The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series.

The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next.

The story went through well with a good last episode as well. But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season).

My Rating : 7/10

My thoughts on Squid Game
This drama started out really strong. I was definitely gripped by the first episode but then it kind of got boring.

•My favourite game was obviously Red Light, Green Light, although that giant doll was the most creepiest thing for me to witness. I also enjoyed watching the one where they had to step on the correct piece of glass.
•The honeycomb challenge was disgusting - all that sweat and licking was ew!
•The marble game was boring and the tug of war game made me too tense. I didn't like to see them dangling on the rope waiting to fall to their death. It was better in the glass game because it was more instant rather than dragging it out.

I was a bit upset when Sae-byeok died, but we know she had to go as the main guy was obviously going to win. That's the thing I don't like about these shows, is when you know that the main lead has to get through the challenges, needless to say I was never worried about him.

The old man was weird and the ending confused me.

It would be good to know why the 'triangles', 'squares', and 'circles' were all in on it. Which reminds me - I loved the scene where Mi-nyeo really needed the bathroom (aka her cigarette) and she said to the triangle that she wanted to see their superior i.e. the square, and then out popped its head. The only funny part of the show in my opinion.

I can only give the acting a 9.0 because the Americans were so terrible. Their acting really brought down the overall production quality of the show.

The music was creepy which was fitting so I thought that was good.

In the end it just fizzled out into nothing really. A guy won a ton of money because he got through challenges whilst everyone else died. What happened with his daughter? Like we need answers but weren't given any.

If there was a second season I really doubt I'd bother to watch it.

A decent entry into the survival game genre while simultaneously fordging nowhere new.
Gory, violent, vulgar, and graphic Squid Game doesn't, as they say, pull any punches. This works in the show's favor as a strong juxtaposition to the candy coated, pastel painted, childlike game world it takes place. And well, that is kinda the whole point. Bookending itself with the very childhood Korean game it is named after ""Squid Game,"" the beginning has it played by children and the ending played by adults. Honestly, the violence exists in both iterations, showing that childhood isn't truly that innocent, and adults are not the different from children.

This idea of ""adult children"" runs through the entirety of the viewing experience. Our main protagonist Seong Gi Hoon / ""No. 456"" played by Lee Jung Jae, a middle aged man living with his mother, comes off as a bratty teenager in the first 30 seconds we meet him as he whines about money while stuffing his face with food his mother made him before she heads off for a day of back breaking work. He lives a life of laziness, selfishness, and failures. Being a dead beat father, who claims he loves his daughter, but then does nothing to support or raise her, he instead spends his time stealing from his mother and gambling. Under tremendous amounts of debt to bookies and loan sharks, his debtors finally place a ticking clock to pay up or ""pay with his body.""

When the mysterious salesman shows up in all his bravado and gets Jung Jae to participate in a game on a subway platform, the audience can see the trap being set with each passing moment. As Jung Jae continuously loses and takes bodily harm as payment for that losing, he maniacally keeps going again and again until he gets that one win. And thus, the mentality of what is to come is shown.

Most of the premier episode deals with just Jung Jae story, and spends a lot of time setting up his place in the world. It isn't until the end of this episode when we get our first game and have glimpses at the other main players we will follow. Is this time well spent, I can't decide. His story does not garner sympathy or paint him as a good person. When he enters the first arena, I particularly didn't care if he lived or died, and well that is a problem. Antiheroes are huge right now, and Jung Jae is most definitely a character that falls in this category. But, unlike Vincenzo, The Devil Judge, or Taxi Driver, he isn't likable. What makes him not-heroic is not ""grey morality"" it is simply being a bad low life human being. He isn't a criminal, but the story has not shown him to be someone you want to root for either.

Other characters are more clear cut with the exception of Cho Sang Woo / ""No. 218"" played by Park Hae Soo. He is a foil to our main lead. Raised in the same neighborhood, and a childhood friend and rival, Sang Woo's life has been almost the opposite of Jung Jae. Coming from a single family stall saleswoman mother household, he educated himself, worked hard, and got himself into the most prestigious university in Korea. To most in the old neighborhood Sang Woo has gone on to be a successful businessman and the golden child of the low income world they all live. Well, at least that is the story his mother and everyone back home knows. In a quick backstory drop by our masked game-masters, it seems he has actually spent his time becoming a white collar criminal who is hiding from the police and 6 billion won worth of multiple financial crimes.

The rest of our main rag tag team of ""good guys"" is filled with a variety of the disenfranchised. Characters that are truly at a larger disadvantage in life than our two already described main male leads. Kang Sae Byeok / ""No. 067"" is the hardened female North Korea defector who has become a thief to survive in South Korea while trying to make a home for her younger brother. She is a very stock creation to pull at the trope of a soft hearted criminal. Luckily Jung Ho Yeon plays her perfectly balanced in ruthlessness and stoicism versus tenderness and vulnerability, which will likely have you rooting for her more than most if not all the others.

Ali Abdul / ""No. 199"" is our illegal immigrant from Pakistan with a heart of gold. The physically strongest of the bunch is also the most cuddly, kind, and naive. Anupam Tripathi plays him with such wide eyed youthful trust that you will want everyone involved to sacrifice themselves for his survival. And lastly, Oh Young Soo as Oh Il Nam / ""No. 001"" finishes our team as an elderly man who is on deaths door with a brain tumor and fighting off the beginning stages of dementia.

To say that we will lose some of these characters along the way is a given. While I won't go into when, how, or why, just suffice it to say that the only character with plot armor is our ML (Remember the whole 1st episode is dedicated to him) and of course one other player, the antagonist evil player, Jang Deok Soo / ""No. 101"". Both are given equal protection to make sure the push and pull between their characters remains until we reach the end. Heo Sung Tae plays the character with ease as at this point if you have seen any Korean dramas you will know how incredibly type cast he has become.

The first game Red Light/Green Light, shows everyone involved of what they have become a part. With an oversized head spinning porcelain doll that counts in a girls childish voice with everyone inside a painted arena-looking like a sandbox on a sunny day-as masked guards in pink suits stand idly with machine guns, the almost 50's Americana design (aesthetics used in video games such as Fallout) are clearly painted.

In the first episode more than half of nearly 500 players are mowed down with gunfire, in what is easily the highest body count of the show. It affects the remaining player-base so much that the survivors demand to be released, setting up a voting that is in the rules of the game. If more than 50% of the players want to quit, then they will all be freed. BUT, before the voting begins the reward for staying and competing is revealed. 100 million won per player dead. Meaning the pot, in the end, will be around 45 billion. If they choose to quit, then the money will be sent to the families of the deceased each getting the 100 million that was put in the pot. This, to say the least, changes the game, and the mind of many who were only moments before begging to go free.

Now here is were the show, I think, makes its greatest fault. That is, in a nail biting vote that comes down to a single player difference, the group is freed and all go back to their lives, but under the condition that if more than 50% want to return the games will recommence. Of course since all this takes place in the first and second episode, it is not a spoiler or remotely unclear that all the players will return. Well at least 187 out of the 201 freed will return.

While the show is trying to make a social statement between the real world and the game, it is hazy in how it draws this comparison. The idea is that these people are so destitute, forgotten, at wits end, and put upon by an unfair society, that ultimately playing in a game to the death for money is not so bad, or at least equally appealing as to living their actual lives. That is, the world itself is a game (Or rat-race) and the only way out of it is death, so why not take that chance at becoming a billionaire by playing an actual game with your life.

Unfortunately, this only holds up if you are morally bankrupt already. Yes, life is hard, it sucks a lot of the time, and there are disadvantages and advantages to it based on simply where you are born, with what color skin, looks, and wealth. However, each person has the choice of what they do with their life and who they choose to become. Look at our main two leads mothers. These are women, that as far as we know, have raised their sons mostly alone. Without wealth or privilege, they have created homes for themselves and opened businesses, and had families. Was it hard, yes. Do we wish their lives were better, of course. But these women show their strength of will and character and do not take shortcuts and thus have created something for themselves as small as it might be.

We can talk about the cop Hwang Jun Ho, played by heartthrob Wi Ha Joon, and how he become a police officer versus his missing brother ( who as far as we know is likely amongst the dead that played in the first game), while raised in the same house, the same family, with the same advantages but ended up in VERY different t places. A persons character, morality, and code matters and it isn't simply the world and society is bad. It is flawed and broken, and needs social change, of course, but this show doesn't show how to accomplish that change. It wants to show what depraved people will do to each other.

Outside of our Pakistani Ali, whose life takes a truly fateful turn in these few days of release as his intentions of leaving Korea and going home are destroyed while being preyed upon by a Korean businessman who uses him as a virtual slave because of his illegal status, everyone who returns to the game returns of their freewill knowing what lies in wait, what they will be forced to do and be a part of, and most importantly with a plan to win. These players that in the beginning where being selfish children and looking for easy money but found themselves in heinous game of mass killing and demanded freedom now become as equally complicit and active agents in the slaughter.

As a viewer, it made me no longer care if any of them lived or died. They are there because they choose to be. They are there because they want the prize. They are there because they are no better than those who devised the arena in which they play. Thus, it is a story of bad people playing with and killing bad people for a huge pot of blood money. And well, that made the show fairly depressing to get through, and gave me very little in the way of wanting to root for a winner antihero or not. If they simply had not done this, not made it where these characters actively choose to return, as a viewer I could have gotten behind and rooted for people I really didn't like, and forgive them for acts they transgress. But that is based on the idea, they were unknowing forced into a bad situation and must do what they can to survive and get out of it. Every character could have been written the same way they are, and I would have rooted for some of them regardless of their faults. In the end, as it was done, I held them responsible for their own deaths and the deaths they cause.

Episode seven is a divisive one that uses homosexuality as the benchmark of the truly depraved and the ultimate bad guy amongst an arena of bad people. Its South Korean entertainment, what can you expect from a homophobic country? It also continues the South Korean trend of using low grade actors whenever a westerner needs to be on screen and paints white wealthy westerners as sexual deviants and the lowest of the low. Whatever, just like The Devil Judges flaw of using the west as homosexuals in a salute to homophobia when sentencing a sexual predator, Squid Game just follows in line.

The aforementioned cop Jun Ho, finally has something to do in this episode, but his entire character seems misplaced and unneeded. How his story unfolds, and where it ends, makes him a character that lives fully in subplot story lines that never lead to any fruition or tie into the main plot of the series. Why did we meet him and spend time with him? What did we learn from his snooping? How did his character impact anything about the story? While his last scene seems to leave some open ended storytelling on the fate of the Squid Game operation, and the fate of himself. The time jump in the last episode of the series seems to answer all the open ended questions that left dangled. And that is, we didn't ever need him as a character.

By the end of the series, there are some twists that MOST will see coming long before they are revealed, and the ending itself is odd and weirdly uncathartic. Maybe that is the point, life isn't cathartic. Crap happens, and then we go on. This was in the end just a ""slice of life"" etc. As a viewer, you don't buy it, and while it hints there may be a sequel, you wonder if there is a point to it. Very few if any of the cast can return. So it will basically be all new characters to meet if we go for round two. And seeing the games again, will be very ""Hunger Games"" number 2, a not as fun go around of the first time. As for the games themselves, we learn very little. Who were all the men in masks? Why are they playing their role? The few that are unmasked are shown to be young and basically psychotic. What do they get out of and how did they get roped into being masked game masters? How do they move through the ranks and get either a lowly circle, gun blazing triangle, or master square ranking?

The main black masked man, is he just evil? After he does what he does and the little we learn about him, his character is basically a walking problem. Being a winner of the games, who chooses to live in virtual poverty in the real world even though a billionaire, but comes back to this world to run, design, and watch others die in games, seems to suggest yeah, he is just a bad guy. He is a confusing mess of a character, and we didn't even spend much time with him unmasked for all these issues to arise. Is season two going to be basically about him? Is that why we have the limousine scene between the winner of these games and him in the end?

Why did Squid Games become so successful? I can't answer this for you. Like the masked game masters that are just there because, this show is the greatest Netflix success, just because it is. While the acting is better in Squid Games, Netflix's Alice in Boarderlands is much stronger in individual game designs for the players, and in dissecting morality and the condition of the human animal when placed into a survivalist world. You also clearly have characters you can and want to root for, even if they are morally dubious. While its premise isn't as grounded and believable as Squid Game's, Alice does create a world that is even more terrifying and allows your imagination to run amok on how it is all happening. Yet Alice, though getting a season 2, has gone mostly unnoticed by the world at large.

Squid Game is worth a watch, provided you can handle the material. It is a solid entry in survival storytelling and creates a generally unique aesthetic to tell its tale. It is very strongly acted, and the Korean Drama plague of caricature side characters or characters written just to be comic relief are mostly if not fully absent. The directing, while straight forward, does keep the story moving and refrains from allowing the actors to have soap boxes, overly dramatic melodrama scenes, or annoyingly cloying moments. The production shines, and is generally in all regards a very top notch experience.

But, do not go into this with unrealistic expectations or with the belief you are going to travel unknown roads. You have seen everything here before, The Purge, Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Alice in Boarderlands etc are just a few from the modern age that travels where this series goes. It does it with more gore than the kid friendly versions but is on par with Alice or The Purge in that department. There are unneeded subplots, unneeded side characters, and a lot of questions that never get answers. In short, it isn't perfect, or mind-blowing. But it is good. 3.5 Stars (7) overall B. Better than the bulk of content Netflix has to offer, but forgettable and in the end not a must see.

Okay hear me out
At the beginning it started slow but I was still attracted to the plot and as it progresses it gets more interesting reaching the end which is a complete meh, leaving aside the ending I can say that it is a good drama.

I liked the cinematography, the characters, the soundtrack and it made me cry a lot in the last episodes, especially episode 6.

Saebyeok and Jiyeon deserved better, for me they are on jeju island drinking mojito together. And I really felt sorry for Sangwoo's mother but I have zero sympathy for Sangwoo for being a traitor and murderer.

The ending is kinda meh, is that it? I hate that it took him a whole year to take Saebyeok's brother out from the orphanage and see his daughter which he cancelled just to get his revenge, I get it but it's still wrong.

It gives me a lump in my throat to know that saebyeok's brother will never know where his sister is and the same with sangwoo's mother who will also never know where her son went.

Also the reason why the front man did that is not well explained, leaving a gap to the plot. In conclusion the ending could be better, but in the other hand the gaming part was very good, although at some point it became predictable like knowing who the front man was, I already knew that he could be the policeman's brother.

The end is an open ending, letting us see how gihun is going to participate in the game again and seek revenge, maybe there will be a second season but I wouldn't like it because what would it be about? the same? other games? could have made a better ending

Weak Ending, lots of crying
Story : going into this show i was skeptical. i have watched kdramas before this, so I was curious why locals were shoving this show in my face. i was surprised while watching it, that it was indeed good. but i think what i got out of it, is different then what other people may have taken out. while we understand the reason for the games, and the meaning behind the show (something that goes over people's heads), i really enjoyed the characters. i am a sang woo apologist, and his character fascinated me. i enjoy having background stories for each person, because it opens up the ability for us to feel when they are eliminated. the ending was...odd. but it was in a sense, closure for Seong Gi-Hun. While I am upset with the red hair dye and not getting on the plane, it leaves open the idea of a season 2. but since almost the whole lovable cast was killed off...i am not sure about that.
Acting: the acting (as to be expected by these names) was stellar. not a dry eye in episode 6. and esp the last scene for sang woo.
Music : i always appreciate shows who actually create a whole new soundtrack for a show, and make it so quirky that it fits. But also makes it so dramatic at the right time that it hurts.
Rewatch Value: i think the shock value of the show makes it not rewatchable. that being said. i am more intrigued in the relationships between he characters as the show progresses so i would only re-watch it for that reason.
Overall: i think it is a good show. not the best kdrama i have watched but good. i will only say its overhyped because of what the western media has turned it into (Mr. beast I'm looking at you). i always laugh that we need to gatekeep kdramas, and this feels like it. i enjoyed watching it, and was exciting to be introduced to new actors.

Squid Game Review
Squid Game is a good show. No surprise there. It was the talk of the town a few months ago but has basically died off by the time I’m writing this. Everything that I wanted to say about this show, I’m sure has been said before. I would, however, love to reiterate how good the final product turned out to be.
There are a lot of ‘win or die’ death game stories out there. ‘Battle Royale’ and ‘The Hunger Games’ are two that come to mind. However, what makes Squid Game that much more interesting is the illusion of choice. The people playing this game are in debt to the extent that they are willing to take their chances dying over it. It’s a horrific statement on the effects of late-stage capitalism and how the rich regard the poor as nothing more than pawns in a game.
Ironically, a lot of rich people seemed to have missed the point entirely. Countless celebrities and influencers are dressing up in tracksuits and breaking dalgona as if they wouldn’t be the leering old men in masks sitting and watching if this were real life. A similar thing happened with the Korean film ‘Parasite’ a few years back but due to the increased popularity of Squid Game, it seems more prevalent now.
It really begs the question, ‘how out of touch do you really have to be to not understand that you are the problem?’

Hunger games 2.0 GONE WRONG justice for SAEBYEOK
I know korea is still a mysoginistic society until now because there government doesnt want women to have power and more equal rights than men and thats the sad truth of the society, but judging the story it felt flat for me the beginning episodes are great BUT after episode 5 it felt DRAGGY and SLOW and i get the betrayal of friends part but i think it feels so injustice of the other characters especially Ali they didi him dirty and still koreans always look down dark or brown skinned people i hate it here and still racist to foreigners ngl though and the ending is still open ended so weed a 2nd season to answer all the several plotholes of previous episodes. Acting is PHENOMENAL HANDS DOWN especially SAEBYEOK i love her role in this its giving me katnis everdeen vibes heheheh purr and GIHUN too i love his kind honest protagonist and especially the front man i love villainess of the characters, high budget production, outfits stages evrything: felt flat for the OST i need lisas money fpr the ost of the 2nd season please it matches the series. Thats all!! yall should watch Alice in borderland it has better plot than the squid game purr.

The cast consists of successful actors and actresses who know how to act professionally. That's what makes the show interesting and valuable to watch, according to my opinion. The story is well written, It is not a long nor a short story which makes the show easier to complete. There are not many characters to recognize so the story is not difficult to understand. I have liked the soundtrack in the show as well, It is kinda catchy and lovable.

I would totally recommend this show to people who like watching action and mystery genres.

I believe it is a good kdrama that makes you think about the money situation in Korea although I would say that the characters are not always true to themselves and they eventually start making choices that benefit the plot instead of themselves.
The character's backstories are definitely interesting but I wish they could have gone into more detail about it - an example is Ali's backstory, we know he went to Korea to make money and that he had a wife+child as well as that he worked in some sort of factory but, other than that, we don't really know much?
Hopefully, if they decide to do a second season, they will give more thought to all of this.

It's Good but that ending NO!!!
Well, overall a good series but not a fan of this ending and not sure why there should be a 2nd season as other suggest/would like.

What I didn't like the most was that it seemed uncharacteristic for Sang Woo to do what he did at the end. He had been ruthlessly playing the game from the start so why the hell didn't he at least attempt to kill Gi Hun one more time when he 'quit' the game especially since he had clearly harbored a grudge against him since they were young b/c of his trusting, gullible nature.

Gi Hun is a ne'er-do-well. Pretty much living off his mither his hole lfe. Never being a good eniugh father to his daughter and then chhoing that at the end??? WTF ????

Didn't like the fact that we didn't get Frontman's backstory and why after winning the game he became that guy and how the hell can he shoot his baby brother AISH!!!

So glad that screeching hag and that gangster died they were the worst. Having foreigners be the VIPs is low hanging fruit but I digress.

Also, can we get a squid game with rich people as the damn contestants - ALL BEING EQUAL and all. I mean the Front Man continued to perpetuate the lie that inside the ""games"" it's equal, above board and essentially fair b/c everyone starts off on the same footing but they had been manipulating the games from the start.

Good plot, interesting but not a good ending.
Maybe it’s just me but it’s too overrated.

I just watch it now to kill time and I really enjoyed it. There are sad relatable scenes and I love that each characters have worthy stories to tell. The game concept is nice too. Playing games you played when you were little. All seems easy but when you lose you also lose your life. The concept of game is good until the players decided to kill each other to win. Well, that adds the intensity of the drama. The detective/ police officer is also smart but didn’t end so well.

Anyway, overall I enjoyed it but not that much. And the ending sucks.

Parasite it was not!
I had such high expectations for this drama. I expected it to be a brilliant, sardonic social commentary like Parasite. Well, I think I'm being unfair comparing it to the film.
It was good. Very good. But it could have been better. So much more than what it is. I hope a second season would add more depth and make the story more rich.
I love the acting. The actors have wonderfully portrayed their characters. I found the evil, rich VIPs to be bland, stereotypical and lackluster. The story feels incomplete. I liked O Henry's ""the last leaf"" inspired death-bed scene albeit it wasn't very satisfying.

It was Ok, but not upto the Hype
My Conclusion: ? It is good yet Overrated drama. Because i honestly think there are many other good and more best kdramas which can be given more attention and somehow are more suitable and good to watch. There's no doubt this drama wasn't good. And the acting was so good. But the useless murdering & there's nothing to learn from it except not to trust anyone easily or teamwork in tug of war task. Lol, that things can be taught through some simpler and good concepts too. I'm not of the type who watched a series and when it finishes ends it. The series actually goes around all time in my head. And i always assume and think what will happen next, if it would have S2, are there any chances for a season 2, was the ending sufficient & things like that. One of the most funny thing is if it doesn't gets season 2 than the role of the Policeman is a waste because it was of no use actually ?. But if it gets S2 maybe it'll make a story.

An interesting watch
(This is my first review so please bare with me) Squid Game is the first K-Drama that I had ever watched and looking back at it i do not regret it. What I liked the most about the show is the character dynamics and the characters themselves were interesting to watch. The games the player participated in were also fun to watch with perfect shock value to look forward to and the show perfectly balanced humour and emotion in my personal opinion. What I didn't like about the show was probably how sort it was. Fortunately season 2 might able to help that out in my interest to see how the story progresses. Overall Squid Game is a good show with an interesting concept and I am looking forward to season 2. :)

When you play the squid game, you win or you die, there's no middle ground
Easily one of the best dramas, if not the best, of the year, so far. This drama just has the perfect mix of drama, suspense, mistery and action while still delivering social criticism regarding specially human nature and how crushing the capitalistic system is for the ones at the bottom.

The pacing of the drama is pretty good, it'll keep you at the edge of your seat and the chiffhangers will just make it almost impossible to stop watching. The reduced amount of episodes also help make the drama binge-worthy, while sparing it the same fate of many dramas that feel bloated because of many useless filler plots and characters. I think Squid Game just has the right amount of run time.

Besides that, the acting is really great. The cast is very convincing and I enjoyed a lot that the writers still managed to delve into the characters backstories and conflicts, otherwise this could've been a huge failure, cause you wouldn't care about any of the characters if they were so shallow. The only portrayals and parts of the script that felt weak were the ones related to the non-asian, english speaking characters, but I've yet to see an english dialog in a korean drama that isn't cringy, so I wasn't really surprised or disappointed.

Another strong suit of this show is the soundtrack. It's simply phenomenal, alternating between complementing the mood perfectly and contrasting with what's being shown to the point of being jarring, which was obviously the intention. In the end, I think the songs fit the scenes perfectly and truelly help you immerse into the story. And I have to say, Squid Game is very good at pulling at your heartstrings, it was the first time where I was at the verge of tears watching a drama.

Now I see that a lot of people seem to have a problem with the ending, and while I can understand it to some extent, I can't agree with it at all. I don't think this show has a good or a bad ending, but rather a very fitting one. It was more of a reflective ending and I think it was a fair conclusion to the events that ocurred.

Overall, Squid Game is an amazing experience to go through. It's a drama that's not afraid of doing what it has to do to tell you a story. I won't comment much more on it, because I honestly think it's best to go into it without knowing much, and spoilers could really ruin your experience, so I'll just recommend this drama to everybody (except maybe for people who can't handle graphic violence or gore) because I really think it's something you have to see for yourself.

Win or Lose it all
I watched this show when it came out from everyone talking about it, they seemed to enjoy it a lot so i did watched it too.
I have to say the story line is very interesting, win money by playing childhood games.
All these persons in needs need money and they are really to do anything to get it, even getting eliminated as the drama says.
The more you see money at your reach the more you want to get it, they just kept on going, no matter what!
The acting is really great! All the different characters are really unique to get to know and follow.
The games were also chose as a way to make them easy for everyone to understand them so we can focus on the rest of the story and the characters.
Although I really liked the drama, I do have to say that I am not a big fan of the ending and which for something different.

Existential Dread, Bitter sweet, Scary realism of the modern world, Masterpiece
Brilliant character writing.. That's all


I don't think SQUID GAME needs to be 'rated"" here or anywhere lol

Literally everyone should know already. It's a WORLD WIDE phenomenon, unlike anything else in a long time. Not slowing down anytime soon either

Funniest thing is, this is Ho Yeon's first ever TV series.. Her first major role.. and it happened to be SQUID GAMES lol She's already the most followed Korean on Instagram already. One of the most followed celebrity world wide. People are obsessed with her

Some insane Fate..

it was worth the hype that it got
the show is so good, very well done compared to many other netflix series. the plot is so full of mystery and creativity, while i know many people did guess about who the cop's brother is etc but there is also things that you cant guess, for exemple it was surprising about how in ep 2 they went back to their old life before going back again in the game that was not expected. the games were really entertaining and horrifying in the same time as its childhood games used like that

the whole hiarchy about the pink soldiers too is really cool, about how the circle ones are the workers, the triangle ones are the army and the square are the managers,then the front man then the host which is on top.there is also a lot of hidden signs in the serie that you cant find easily ,about how the old man is behind it all and how the games are on the wall and its really cool.
now lets talk about the cast, i dont think there is a better cast than this, the acting is really on top. ep 6? seriously you cant stop the tears, you find yourself so attached to the characters which is something you dont find in every serie. it shows you as well how humans behave when they are desperate so you see a lot of different behaviors from those who sacrifice themselves to those who trick others to survive and its true that every one deal with those situations differently depending on their mental health and their personality. the only thing to criticize here is the vips acting,its cringy and doesnt look realistic to me but again its a korean show so they probably werent aware of it, also if the vips are full of foreign people who dont all speak english fluenty then it could turn cringy, i just dont think that all of them are american.

the last thing i want to mention is the music, its so so goooooood, the ""pink soldier"" song is so addicting and there is other songs that are also so cool.
overall the show deserve the hype and you can feel that there is a lot of effort behind it im happy when people who worked so hard got what they deserved, for now i can only wish that season 2 dont be rushed, i want them to take their time and make a good plot i dont want it poorly done because season 1 really give high expectations

I fell asleep watching some episodes
My son asked me to watch this cos he enjoyed it, and it being his first K-drama. So my husband and I sat down to watch. We managed to complete the series but can you believe it? I fell asleep from ep 1 to 3 and even the last ep. The 1st 3 episodes were particularly a pain to watch as they established the plot and we only continued to see if there were any redeeming qualities. Although the plot picked up a little, overall it was rather underwhelming for us and we are scratching our heads over the hype. My son agreed that it's overhyped but he liked it cos it showed him ""the true colors of people"". I think the storyline is unique but the drama doesn't make me care for any of the characters. Okay, maybe I cared a little for Ali. I didn't feel sad about the girls. I was disgusted with the sex scene although I guess they wanted to establish what a desperate woman needs to resort to to survive. The insertion of the ""police investigation"" was quite stupid although it wasn't exactly meaningless. Anyway I told my son, there are so many better K-dramas around. But I gotta give it for being clever to be so popular.

Extremely High Execution of a Very Used Concept
I watched this on the spur of the moment after having 0 intention of watching it previously, because tbh how many times have manga/anime fans seen this survival game concept? Growing up with Japanese entertainment, NOTHING about this show was new at all, but I still loved it. I suppose for Westerners it might be new, but for me the shock factors or disturbing qualities didn't stand out from originality but from the pure execution. I could say the majority of the plot turns were predictable as well but the pacing and performances were SO good, that it kept me on the edge of my seat. The violence/gore wasn't emotionally or mentally straining and was easy to get to used to after the initial shocks of the first two episodes.
I LOVED the detective. Passionately :D and not just because that man is incredibly fine, but his character addition really added to the quick pacing of the show, mixing in another storyline so as to almost give us a breather from the dirty inhumane warehouse feeling the other characters endured. I believe that the alternations of character/story focuses was what was really done well because it always kept you rolling and focused. A ""next, next, next action"" experience.
The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because I really felt that the ending of some characters was rushed. Episode 8-9 definitely lacked the full emotional appeal of loss for me and I was mildly disappointed but I understand there was a time crunch.
I've never stayed up all night to watch a show before, but I did for Squid Game. I was absolutely groggy the next day but it was worth it. I'm currently rewatching it with my mom, and it is still an incredibly crisp viewing. The camerawork and colors were executed very, very well and I look forward to watching Hwang Dong Hyuk's other works.
The ""novelty"" of Squid Game that's all over media is 100% Western hype in my opinion, but tbh with how well done this show was, it probably deserves it.

Interesting concept, though nothing groundbreaking
Was interested in the concept of the game when I decided to watch even though I'm more of a rom-com guy. Definitely an entertaining watch. The cast did a fantastic job portraying their roles. Lee Jung-jae did a great job playing his character, although it took a little getting used to his character given his personality at the beginning of the show. Heo Sung-tae did a great job as the thug guy as I wanted him to die a very gruesome death very early on. Jung Ho-yeon as Kang Sae-byeok was definitely my favorite out of all of them. Her character was intriguing and I found myself rooting for her the most.

The show focuses on the greed of individuals and the power money can have over a person. The motivations behind the creation of the game and the leaders who control it didn't really stick with me, and there really isn't any clear punishment for those running the game by the end of the show (probably setting up for a season two). A lot of gruesome deaths, annoying people making stupid choices, and some heartfelt moments where I actually teared up a few times. The game itself is rather straightforward and isn't anything particularly interesting or thrilling to watch, although it is enough to make you continue watching to see what happens next. The main ""game"" is really the relationships between the characters and their greed versus morality.

Overall, an fun and exciting show that's worth a watch. You may need to look past the absurdity of the game itself, as it could never happen in real life, but the show still provides entertaining situations and characters who you'll be rooting for.

Bit of more spoilers so if you dont like to spoil dont read..
When red light green light start i feel thrilling and i like the way ali help to gi hun even other playes paniced and cant think of anything... From the 1st episode i hated mi nyeo she is really irritating woman 'itz good no one choose her in 4th game'. tht is how i thought but she did not killed in that time but it also for good ( you can found why in last 2 episodes)
Sang woo i dont like him becoz when 2nd game honey comb hapenning why he did that to others?? Itz not one to one game.. i felt he is selfish man and he prove it in 4th game he choose ali becoz he thought it was game like 3rd one, that is why he choose ali and he is completely play unfairly, ali won the game but he tric him.. poor ali try to help him even the end i hate sang woo
And when marble game start and gi hun going to loss old man help him when he ask wht did u say.., n he try to help him but wht gi hun did he trick him... but gi hun is actually not bad and selfish guy like sang woo he thought, no one going to choos old man then he will die, so he choose him but game happend to be like that but anyhow Old man going to give winning to gi hun he should have play fair then old man not going to dead in heart break..
I think in 4th game we saw real humanity and new friendship between 2 girls.. ji yeong wants to give winning place for sae byeok without playing fairly.. she choose her as frnd only for gratitude to asking her to come thier group in 3rd game.. and sae byeok also did not want to get winning place without playing fairly.. i want her to win in the end i rute her completely

Whole thing i wrote up thire is things i wrote while watchng it but in the end episode somthings are changed but until the end sae byeok is really good girl with humanity n sang woo is selfish... but about gi hun somthing was changed but i am not going to write it here becoz even who likes to read spoilers , it would be better not known who was behind this ? it is somthing and someone you never thought.. itz not too strong drama from first episode but it has bit of strong feeling but i feel it become weak n weak when it closed to end.. i think it has lack of emotions not actors fault i think itz script fault

All the cast members really gave there best for characters

Background is very cool all the places are like candy to my eyes

The Extreme Measures for Money
Whether you live in a capitalistic environment or not, the universal term money is globally acknowledged as a main trade item for any kind of purchase. The interchangeable item is powerful enough to let anyone gain ownership of any item from miniscule stuffs to gigantic objects. With human’s eagerness of ownership, people could take extreme measures to reach their goals including being massively in debt thanks to their countless loans. Logically, for the boundless pledgees those loans can be hardly repaid. However, by stepping out of reality, if they were offered to earn an insanely huge amount of cash by playing several rounds of childhood games, perhaps they would like to give it a shot.

Welcome to Squid Game, players are welcomed to play six rounds of folk games in a span of six days. The winner is granted cash prize worth 45.6 billion won. Players are recruited unbeknownst of themselves by an anonymous company (that has a circle, triangle, and rectangle logo) at their lowest moments (in terms of debts). But at what cost? No one told them initially until it was revealed that losers of each rounds will be eliminated by literally being shot to death.

Squid Game has 456 players and many other extras. The show centers around Seong Gihun, a divorced man without proper occupation nor custody of his 10 year-old daughter. Additionally, Gihun has a high attraction for bettings. The ironic life Gihun was living depicted a harsh condition that perhaps a lot of people has ever experienced. Despite that, his humanity nature is delightful and brought a realistic touch to the character. His clever and notorious best friend, Cho Sangwoo, also happened to be in the game due to his business activities. From the short narrative alone, it is hardly surprising that Sangwoo turns out to be a sly, opportunistic, and egoist individual. Both characters are executed immensely by the actors.

On the other side, the supporting characters added dynamics within the players and the story in general. Kang Saebyeok, a North Korean defector with cold-yet-alluring persona was excellently performed by Jung Hoyeon (an impressive acting debut). The manipulative Han Minyeo, trustful Ali, thug-like Duseok, and the old man are some of other characters that made Squid Game interesting. Another important character, Hwang Junho, instantly became viewer’s favorite due to his fearless personality. Several other players noticeably added more fascinating elements to the drama.

Onto the story, Squid Game delivered a relatively slow yet thorough buildup from Gihun’s back story, player recruitment process, until the game itself. Some people might not enjoy the slower approach but I do think it gives the viewers a better idea in understanding the game, character’s emotion, and situations in which they were facing. Even though we must note that the main games are brought with rather sudden, thrilling, and sadistic approach. Within the tight span of 9 episodes, the 6 games and plots are generally distributed properly that it could raise many questions by the end of each episodes, leading to a binge-watching experience. Another point worth mentioning is Junho’s subplot. Although his character can be considered as an outlier, his infiltration to the game as a worker provided a nice different point of view of the game’s system in general.

While I do enjoy most of Squid Game, the series couldn’t hold its thrilling journey for the whole 9 episodes. It sort of wore off after the fifth game. Personally, I do think Squid Game was mostly carried by the dynamics and interactions of each characters. As soon as they kill the important roles, the excitement of this series began to let loose. Each episodes automatically have more gaps to be filled in. With a mountain-like structure, the Kdrama reached its climax on the sixth episode (fourth game) as it jumbled a mixture of vulnerability and moral dilemma that generated an emotional chaos for the viewers.

Another standout point of Squid Game is the fine extra attention to the details. Almost every single frame/scenes have its own symbolism or implicit messages. There are many moments worth mentioning but foremost it was in the dynamics of the players. During the team selection processes, the players depict several examples of discriminations—that can be generalized to communities across the globe. Whether it be racism to those who doesn’t look like a majority (in this case Ali for not looking like a Korean), sexism to women for being labeled as weak, or ageism (which only happened to the old man). Additionally, the VIPs being mostly old white man is a nice touch as to the picture of being colonized by white people or even their arguably terrible-yet-great acting in thinking they own “the world”.

The details didn’t stop there. Some people may or may not have noticed but the Squid Game creators actually dropped some hints ever since the very beginning of the drama (hence why I wasn’t really shocked for the twists). Gihun had been inescapably affiliated to the number 456: from his player number, until the amount of money he won from the horse betting (4.56 million won). He also gave his daughter a gun-shaped lighter as a present present inside a black box tied with pink ribbon—pretty similar to the “coffins” in the game. The old man was suspicious for numerous times including being excited on the first game, able to stop the night fight, and not wanting to switch shapes during the second game with Gihun—but he wrapped it perfectly with the dementia excuse.

The excessive details are honestly compelling yet some of them fell short and was left unfinished. Saebyeok climing arc was an interesting take with the screw not being attached properly. However, they just left her action the way it was—a wasted subplot there. Some questions were also left unanswered such as: how the workers get there, why Junho’s brother played such an important role and can remain MIA for over 5 years, The VIPs back stories, Junho and the police whereabouts. While those questions might bait the existence of a second season, I honestly pointed those out as Squid Game felt finished in general and it didn’t really have the necessity to continue especially if they are going to keep it centered around Gihun. Instead, if they decided to resume, it would be better to switch it into a spinoff about the workers.

A further point that made Squid Game distinguishable and attractive is the production. Having childhood games as the main theme, the series brought such sadistic and thrilling stories wrapped in colorful sets. The ironic contrast definitely left an eye-catching impression for all the viewers and even those who have only seen the short clips circulating on the internet. The consistency of the costumes also marked a strong point for Squid Game. Though the red jumpsuits of the workers might be similar to the ones in Spanish TV show Money Heist, the other styling still felt original and has its points of being iconic (that perhaps could be recited sometime in the future).

The viral sensation Korean Netflix Series, Squid Game, has an enormous amount of points to be remarkably acclaimed in the contemporary TV Shows landscape. Although, I must admit that the show wasn’t a completely perfect journey. Regardless of the decision whether the creator of Squid Game would like to continue onto the next seasons, the standalone 9 episodes (so far) are worthy to be the talk of the public.

Emotionally devastating, intelligent, masterful.... and overrated
Let me just say, I LOVE Squid Game, I adore it, and I wholeheartedly agree with its message, but it didn't live up to the hype it was getting. I'm really not the type of person to watch something just because it's popular and to be honest, I had no intention of watching this at first because the concept didn't appeal to me. But more on this later. And all in all, I'm glad I decided to watch anyway.

So, yes, Squid Game is a sad, sad show all the way through, a show that displays the harsh and horrific reality of being poor in a modern-day capitalist society that lends no mercy to its disadvantaged citizens. We have our main character, Seong Gi-hun, who is introduced as a sort of pathetic, debt-ridden gambling addict, a habitual smoker, a failed business owner, the type of guy who gets in trouble with illegal loan sharks and still manages to shamelessly beg his own friends for money, and a man who makes minimal effort to be involved with his family... and yet, he's a total sweetheart who cares for others, who still wants to be involved in his daughter's life despite divorcing her mother, who takes in the weak, unwanted underdogs in a game of life or death. This, I loved.
I can't describe how happy it made me, that a poor character is portrayed as a real human despite doing all these terrible things. It seems like Gi-hun has ended up so poor because of his own bad decisions, and despite being kind of a bad person when it comes to money who has ruined so many relationships, he's still such a NICE person. Goes to show how even the kindest people can resort to terrible actions when they're struggling financially.

The plot was entertaining, with lots of chilling details, and that's aside from the kids' games where players are killed off one by one, both by outside forces and by one another. There's the cheerful kiddie music that sounds like a 4th grade music class (I bet the Americans were getting violent flashbacks to the dreaded Recorder Unit), colorful sets, and even those shape guards felt like a childish playground hierarchy. Although the vaguely hunger-games style thing isn't anything new, it being cute-ified with all the kids' games, as opposed to just making people kill one another directly, is a weirdly interesting idea, and watching everyone slowly bring forced to turn against one another was wildly entertaining. Every time someone betrayed, I was like ""Yes!! Get their ass!!"" And it was, you know, a decent critique of capitalism, but I don't want to elaborate just because I feel that using fake, dystopian scenarios makes anti-capitalist messages kind of superficial tbh.

(MAJOR SPOILERS IN THIS PART) But Jesus Christ, it was so stupidly predictable that I didn't even care for most of the characters just because I knew who was going to win. Maybe that part wasn't supposed to be surprising, but if it WAS, then they shouldn't have bothered with a main character who gets more backstory and screentime than anyone else. Like, who else would it BE besides Gi-hun? I love the guy, but I was hoping deep down that he wouldn't survive just so I'd be wrong about at least something. And, BTW, everyone who was hating on him for not getting on the airplane at the end is so wrong for that. That phone call sounded like a threat to me, and I'm just saying, if I was the sole survivor of the game and someone who had used my struggle as entertainment told me to get on a plane like they knew my exact location and what I was doing at the moment, I'd be way too scared to listen.

And now, what I was talking about earlier: Perhaps the reason Squid Game was rejected so many time over the span of so many years wasn't because it was depressing or weird, but because it wasn't... that amazing of an idea? It was a good show and all, but I've seen things like this a hundred times. Lots of people from all over the world have created shows and books and movies with similar plots, and some have even accused Squid Game of plagiarizing a Japanese film even though Squid Game was apparently created first, which goes to show just how not-new it is. Squid Game is a fantastic take on an overdone concept, and I think we should accept that instead of pretending it's something revolutionary.

But really, if you want to watch it, or you don't but you're open-minded enough to give it a chance anyway, don't hesitate to do so :)

Life Should be About More than just Surviving
When I first started watching this drama, I wondered if there was a message to it. Only when I got to the end, I realized it had a powerful message about survival and sacrificing for the person next to you. The drama was almost like a warning for people not to lose touch with their humanity, especially in today's world where watching other people's misfortunes has become entertainment. I enjoyed Squid Game, the concept, and everything from how the events unfolded flowed seamlessly, even as grim and bloody as it got. I felt the writer, director, and all the actors did a fantastic job delivering and actualizing the story. I particularly liked Wi Ha Joon in the role of the cop and brother, who does the impossible to find and save his brother, only to find out he was the one who needed saving and from his own brother. It was a grim moment to take, but as they say, sometimes family can be your worst enemy. I was pleasantly surprised to see Lee Byung Hun in the drama. I didn't expect that.

I must say I loved Lee Jung Jae for learning and teaching the remaining survivors Park Hae Soo and Jung Ho Yeon, through such a twisted and blood ordeal, that maybe life should be about more than just surviving alone. But to find out that the journey was nothing but one person's sick attempt to have fun with their bored life, and to think nothing of the many lives lost was appalling. So in that sense, I completely understood why, despite getting what he so desperately wanted, and especially after working as fiercely as he did to not want it anymore. It's like they say, be careful what you wish for, you might get it only to find it wasn't something you needed after all, because the loss far outweighed the gain. Money isn't everything after all. I cannot wait for a second season. There has to be one.

Gripping and Bingeable show but doesn’t need a second season
Like the headline says, Squid Game is pretty gripping and held my attention very well. It was a nice change to the 16 hour long episode dramas that I’m used to watching and I will highly recommend to kdrama vets and newbies. However, after watching, I’m ready to get back what I know. As usual, the Korean actors were amazing but the Americans really messed it up for me. As an American, I cringed every time they were in a scene. This drama was obviously created to appeal to Western audiences because there were a lot of things going on that other kdramas wouldn’t dare touch. I get wanting to appeal to larger audiences but ugh, the Americans really irked me. They were so stereotypical “rich white American guys” who “American-ed” around to get their way. Maybe their roles were to be the comic relief from so much gore but they were all just super corny and cringey and their acting was a bit rough. Anywho, overall, the drama was entertaining but the end kind of alludes to another season that I hope does not happen. First season was good, let’s not ruin it with another and even more bad American actors.

Stressful and intense
Squid Game (2021)

Likes
1. Loved the six games and how each game levelled up the intensity and danger. Esp the tug of war and the glass bridge. I didnt like the honeycomb. I probably would have died in the first game! ?
2. The killings were brutal and i was stressed every single game, but knowing that the leads wont die til the very end made the game less fun.
3. At one point i thought the lesson of the show was to learn to share and not be too greedy. Or find a way to work together and get out alive not kill each other and they will all get the money. But i was wrong both times.

Dislikes
1. The main lead mostly passed the levels because of luck or someone else. Same with Saebyeok, she also didnt fo anything but sulk. Sangwoo was strategic but in the end he lost against the morally nice guy. Is that the message the writer eants to tell us?
2. But then the reveal of the main guy and his explanation didnt make sense. Why go through all of that and kill hundreds of people every time just for the fun of it?
3. After all the blood sweat and tears, Gihun sat on the money for a year and didnt use them! At least pay off Sangwoo's debts and get Saebyeok's brother out. But dumping the money and the brother with Sangwoo's mom was also terrible. I was hoping Gihun will be more responsible after this but he's still dumb.
4. Felt like Junho had a separate story that didnt feel connected with the rest. And why Inho became the host was not explained.

This series was not at all the quality I came to expect after playing multiple squid games games in roblox (hexa game, red light, green light, fish game, squid game). The quality of those roblox games were much higher then the show itself, that is precisely why I suggest everyone reading this review to simply play the roblox games instead of wathing this show on netflix (it is not as good). That is all for this review folks. Hope you learned something. Like and Follow for more. Also roblox is very cool (not sponsored=

great cast, eerie story
As someone who's a big fan of Alice in Borderland, this genre suite my taste perfectly. It's so eerie in a nonchalant way, how each individual factor of the cinematography contributes to the unsettling mood. The music fit in so perfectly, I'm honestly such a big fan.
As mentioned in some other reviews, it started off strong and caught my attention however the ending and last few games felt too fast. The ending becomes more and more expected after the halfway mark--which makes it less climatic as it could be. (which doesn't really do some of the characters justice)
On the bright side, the casting is absolutely amazing; I was highkey cringing at the VIPs' acting,,,that english and the things they said were so cringey I would rather have them be Asian people or just Korean. The main casting was really great, I'm glad they didn't decide to cast anyone who was super well known or the go-to norm popular actors/actresses. Seeing new faces (some of them were, at least) was really refreshing :) Also i love how we're seeing more of Wi Hajun these days;; he's very eye candy and gives such manly vibes; i support LOL
This series really makes you question your morals and how you would react if you placed yourself in their shoes... the human instinct and selfishness is very complicated; so I couldn't exactly say I hated any of the characters for acting the way they did (ahem sangwoo smh).
All in all, Squid Game was incredibly good, I'd certainly like to see more of it. The cinematography is beautiful (they understood the assignment alright), the music was such a great contribution, and the casting was the icing on the cake. Great film overall, I highly recommend watching!

Willie Wonka Run Amok
Oh that beloved Willie Wonka, inviting kids on a great adventure in a colorful, magical playland with the promise of a wonderful lifetime prize! And if terrible things happen to the other kids, does that stop the fun? Does everyone insist they be allowed to leave immediately? Do the parents resort to violence to save their children from a possibly terrible fate? Why no! There's a prize to be won and the terrible fate is only possible, not certain. Besides it's the other guy who's most likely to lose.

And thus, Hwang Dong Hyuk pays homage to a treasured children's tale and turns it into a gory story about beleaguered, debt-ridden adults in Nightmare Joseon who receive a golden ticket (actually a business card, because, you know, adults) to play in a game that could forever change their lives. Like the kids at the Chocolate Factory, the Squid Game contestants sign a contract with murky fine print and the fun begins. It doesn't take long, however, for the players to stop playing against the house and start playing against (and preying on) each other. After all, the rich and powerful can never be rich and powerful enough to allow the unwashed masses play against them indefinitely. By sheer numbers alone, the unwashed would eventually become the conquerors. In order for the rich to continue to win, they have to ensure that the masses turn on each other. And the masses do. They always do. Even in children's games.

Seong Gi Hoon is a ne'er-do-well chaffeur from a small town who has had a hard time at life. A failed marriage and failed business ventures have left him a middle-aged, debt-ridden, deadbeat dad who has no qualms about stealing money from his hardworking and sick, elderly mother for a day of betting on the horses. When his luck at the racetrack goes pear-shaped and he learns that his mother needs surgery, it is only with the most minimal modicum of shame that he demands that his remarried ex-wife give him the money he needs. His ex-wife's new husband acquiesces with one small caveat: Gi Hoon can have the money only if he agrees to stay away from his family (including Gi Hoon's 10-year old daughter). Drawing the line at losing access to his child, Gi Hoon refuses the money then meets a mysterious stranger in the subway who invites him to join the Squid Game.

The other contestants (both friends and foes) in the Squid Game have sad and sorry stories similar to Gi Hoon: an old man dying of a brain tumor, small-time loser gangsters, embezzlers, fraudsters, desperate immigrants and pickpocket defectors from North Korea. Whenever one of the contestants dies from the rigors of the game, they are placed in beribboned coffins that look oddly reminiscent of the last-minute gift from an arcade claw machine that Gi Hoon gets for his daughter's tenth birthday (the present inside the gift box is a nice little foreshadowing touch as well). Although the brutality of these games hearken to the Hunger Games and Stephen King's The Long Walk, these contestants are here totally of their own free will (as are the contestants in another dystopian/art-imitates-life classic, ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"") and all of them can stop the games and leave at any time if the majority of the contestants vote to do so.

One of the flaws of this story is that the contestants have nothing more than the masked host's word that the winner will actually receive the cash prize. Unlike with Willie Wonka (and other dystopian tales)--where the media and the public were aware that a major prize was involved so that there would be some accountability--the contestants of the Squid Game are whisked away to a private and secret location and don't even know who their host is. Even the gun-toting Oompa Loompas at the funhouse are masked. The contestants don't even know if the money they are shown in a giant piggy bank is real money, or if the stacks of cash are only blank sheets of paper with real legal tender only on the outside. They are willing to put their lives on the line simply on the Squid Game's host's word that they could win a life-changing prize.

Another flaw is the incredible stupidity of some of the players, even in a game where they have bet their lives. In real life, people can make some incredibly poor choices, but some of the choices the contestants of Squid Game make are beyond the pale. Trusting your opponent when it is clear it's his life against yours, annoucing your game strategy to all and sundry, being fine with killing a whole bunch of people one day, hesitant to kill a solitary person the next. Some of the players obviously have a code, it's just really difficult from game to game to ascertain what that code is. There are no heroes in this extended voluntary death match, which is why it is so strange that the screenwriter is so determined to make it appear that there is one.

The imagery in this series is impressive: the bright, primary colors, the children's playground, the baggy costumes of the guards that evoke blindly obedient Oompah Loompas, the maze of staircases the contestants tread to each new game. Behind the colorful and child-like facade the brutality of the games is revealed and the hardships began. The contestants are given adequate food at the start of the games, but with each subsequent game the food becomes less substantial. The area where they take their rest literally shifts beneath their feet and becomes dangerous and hostile. Bit by bit, the contestants are stripped of provision for their basic needs, peace and security and eventually their humanity.

There are traces of Snow Piercer and Battle Royale in Squid Game as well. Westerners, rich Americans in particular, are portrayed as effeminate, obnoxious, sex-obsessed VIPs who bet on the games and desire to make Asian men their bitches. The acting abilites of the men who portray these VIPs is terrible (as is the stilting dialogue) and I am not sure if they couldn't secure better casting for these roles or if they wanted to portray Westerners as incapable of competent acting as well. Nevertheless, the message of contempt for the West is not subtle.

The eventual winner of the Squid Game becomes disillusioned with money and the workings of the world after his victory and in possible foreshadowing, adopts a hairstyle and hair color strongly reminiscent of Batman's violent counter-cultural revolutionist, The Joker. He learns more about the game as he prepares to take an important journey and once again, the Squid Game changes his life. In subsequent sequels, will the victor find out that like Willie Wonka, the master of the Squid Game was manipulating his life all along? Or, as in Snowpiercer, will he outsmart, outplay and outlast long enough to view the Squid Game as a lesser evil for the good of society and be chosen as the new master of the game? Will elements of another dystopian tale, The Watchmen, factor into future sequels? After all, as today's billionaires show us daily with their ability to circumvent laws and achieve what only the gross natural product of whole countries could heretofore do, money is the new superpower and without it, the rest of us are just desparate contestants in a never-ending, Everlasting Gob-stopper of a Squid Game.

Utter madness....
Holy hell this bgame show was really madness!

Gambling with your life, killing friends, taking lives, all just for a dollars?

The games were utterly wild and there a couple of games i remembered playing but after watching this makes me see the games we played in a whole new light.

The show it self was really good and different, was enjoyable, the players and games were well set up.

A couple of surprises towards as too who the people were behind the masks.

The ending a bit of a disappointment, in the sense he played the game came out the winner and yet he lived his life unchanged, i get going through all of that will take it toll and you would probably need counselling after it, but i do feel he could have been a better person or helped the people he knew.

Overall not something i would re watch in a hurry. But definitely a good show

Worth the hype :)
I wasn't sure at first that this would be for me, I'm usually more of a romance based story lover, but this really surprised me. Squid game has no romance, and I wasn't bothered in the least about it. I was just an interesting story with morally grey compelling characters.

I'm a bit confused about the ending. I'm not sure if they did it that way so that there could possibly be another season or just to make the viewer think? But overall, this kept me very engaged and I really liked it a lot!

If the creators were to do another show set in this world, I would LOVE to see more about how it started, how the workers are chosen and just more about the frontman. The frontman had the potential to be a really interesting character, the story just wasn't focusing on him. I just want to know why he chose to join the game maybe even (SPOILERS) see what his original game was like and ultimately led him to abandon his family and become a major part of the game.

Again I was very excited for this drama because it reminds me of the j-drama Alice in Borderland which I really liked. I binged this in 2 days as well.

It was interesting to see how the games were inspired by children's ones although some of them were better than others and two of the games seemed really boring to me as for a viewer.

The characters were realistic and I was really happy to see the Indian actor there who scored quite a major role in the drama!

I rate Squid Game 8/10. It left me with some unanswered questions and the latter games weren't that interesting but it was still a wild ride to watch in a good way.

Pretty average
Not so impressive but it's a decent watchable series, the main thing that i felt was its too dragging except when your not in the gaming situation. The story didn't emotionally connected to me. Comparing to Alice in Borderland this series lacks in many factors.

The whole situation not look very serious or intense in so many points, it makes sense only after the episode 7. Everything was predictable may be not in the case of that 2nd cameo also the things that happening in the finale Episode. Not much edge of the seat moments whole things looks nothing new. E08 was my favourite, i only got tensed in that episode, the 5th game was really exciting. It not necessary to forcefully make love, that intimate scene looks not apt to the situation.

I don't know why but i kept comparing this to Alice in Borderland throughout the whole series, may be i expected something different. And the finale Episode was the most irritating one.. its dragging like crazy. Definitely left the gate open for a new season no surprise for there but need to improve a lot if it renewing it again...

strictly personal opinion,

it was heart clenching and gut wrenching and simply devastating. it's devastating how on point it is. how the rich controll everything. how it has always been like that and always will be.

it was devastating to see someone lose their friend. it wasdevastating to see someone lose their spouse. it was devastating to see someone lose their new-found gganbu. it was devastating to see someone lose their sister. it was devastating to see someone kill their brother. it was devastating to see how much someone has to do in order to survive.

I'm sickened and saddened and just out of words. and it's not only because I witnessed so much acted suffering, it's because it's real. because it's my, your, our reality. and there's no way of changing it.

a Must-Watch 2021 Series on Netflix
The Squid Game series, as per the summary, is a harsh test of morality and humanity. It’s a pattern we’ve seen time and time again. Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of ‘Squid Game’; however, gave viewers a unique narrative making sure viewers can still relate to it.

Imagine that individuals in desperate need of money are given the opportunity to compete in various children’s games. They accept the bizarre invitation in the hopes of winning easy money, oblivious to the horrors that will cost them their lives.

Predictable storyline saved by exemplary production value and acting
Truly on-the-edge of your seat production. While it's not difficult to predict what'll happen in Squid Game, it's the journey that makes this show such an enjoyable watch. The games themselves are suspensful and keep your eyes glued to the screen; the characters are well-done and three-dimensional. Personally I didn't see too much philosophy and discourse on the social gap that the games address (on-screen), but like another review I've read online say, you can engage in this show in whatever level you're comfortable with, whether as a superficial battle-to-the-death or a more in-depth analysis on the social state of society.

PROS
❀ Action was well done, cinematography was on point, and in general the production was top notch | I think this is the highlight of what makes or breaks a familiar storyline that hinges on emotion and action. The camera work allows the characters' faces (and subsequently, emotions) to shine, and the sets and costumes are attention-grabbing. I'm especially a fan of the green tracksuits vs. pink solider outfits, as well as the stairs that model Escher's relativity.
❀ Cool easter eggs that keep you guessing | I love that the writer/director (I believe the same person) added little hints throughout the episodes that watchers can latch onto. It keeps us engaged despite using predictable plotlines as we keep watching to find out if those hints we found had a basis. (The feeling of victory when you had the correct guesses>>>)
❀ Characters... wow | I think the acting took the cake in this drama. I like that we see both familiar faces (like the cameo from the crowd popular Gong Yoo as well as Lee Jung Jae as the MC), as well as rising stars (Jung Ho Yeon that became a fan favorite as well as Anupam Tripathi - a win for South Asian casting in S. Korea). It felt like each player gave it their all and you really end up cheering for them. Personally I liked every player - even the underhanded ones like No. 101 and 218. Each of them are on the spectrum of morally gray whether it's their background, personality, or both that galvanized them to join the squid games. I also enjoyed No. 456's journey from ep 1 to 9; he does have a little of that protagonist glow/armor going on towards the latter episodes (as well as the mentality of a shounen anime MC), but I like that it gives a bit of light to an otherwise rather morose and dark show. The hopeful note the show ends on (as well as the hint of another season) can only be met by such a character.
❀ Music that fits the scenes SO well | I'm in love with the soundtrack. Even as I'm typing this, I'm listening to dubstep remixes of the Pink Soldier theme. The OSTs are paired perfectly with the eerie roboticism of the workers, secret motives of the players, and mysterious powers of the frontman. This ties in, again, with the excellent production and attention to details that the cast and production team focused on.
❀ Tight writing that doesn't drag despite being more character-focused | I think the writer did an excellent job in keeping Squid Game concise yet emotional. We go through character backgrounds, but those scenes are a help rather than a hindrance to the story as we begin to empathize with them. For characters that got less screen time (ex: the player with the nose ring), their acting/actions were more than enough to make them grow on you. Anything more would have lessened my engagement.

CONS
✕ The plot is a lil been there, done that | When it comes to human psychology and the huge wealth gap, the show doesn't offer too much to the conversation. (Interesting exception: pointing out the injustices of foreign workers in S. Korea, which is a topic I've never seen in media before.) Otherwise, like I mentioned in the title of this review, the messages aren't shocking or revolutionary. No. 456 goes down a familiar path that well-liked MCs have gone through before while sustaining his humanity and a (generally) positive outlook on society.

OVERALL
Not going to lie, I was sweating buckets while watching some of the episodes. Squid Games is suspensful, well-produced, and features a diverse cast of characters that'll grip you from start to finish. One of the best parts is that season 1 is relatively short (9 1-hour episodes) and once you start, you won't want to stop. (It took me 2 weeks to even start after prodding from friends and family, and after the games started I was all in.) Recommended for a thrilling watch with a little gore, a lot of death, and the characters that really make the show shine.

(Note: My rewatch value is set to 5.0 always as a default as I'm not the type to rewatch dramas EVER. Thus, I do not take it into account when calculating overall score.)

The Childhood of Your Nightmares
I usually don't watch things like this because well.. i'm a chicken LMAO but from episode 1 it really got me hooked and I couldn't stop watching. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, the deaths were definitely shocking once they initally happened but then in a way you get desensitized when it happens the second time, if that makes sense. Some deaths hurt more than others because of the attachment i grew for some of the characters and others I either thought were an epic way to go out or didn't for at all cause of who they were. Won't say too much else but the plot twist was definitely something and the end in general just annoyed me. The soundtrack definitely helped set the mood. After this, I'll definitely won't be able to think of certain games without thinking of Squid Game. Everything considered , I still recommend it.

I surrendered to the hype. As I started only airing dramas, I had the time to finish this one pretty quick (I mean one day) and I have to say that I understand the boom that I talk about in my last post. Although it isn't the kind of drama that I frequently watch, is undeniable that this production is amazing and is not from thin air the success that we can see involving this now.

""Squid Game/Round 6"" tells the story of Seong Gi Hoon (Lee Jung Jae), a broken man who lives with his mother and has many debts to pay because of his addiction to gambling. The life of Gi Hoon changes when he met a man who presents an opportunity to earn a lot of money participating in a secret game. What Gi Hoon didn't know is his life and the life of others 455 people would be at risk because of that.

We can see a lot of references in this drama, as ""Matrix"", ""Saw"", ""Hunger Games""... I read a lot of reviews telling about copy, but I don't think this is the case. It's impossible to talk about survivor games without reply some aspects from other productions, but ""Squid Game"" has its particularities, which I can't mention here because it is a no-spoiler review. I was a little hesitant to start this because I heard so many bad reviews mentioning the violence and wrong ideas that I was scared, but now that I finished I really don't understand these critics.

Of course, is a violent drama, and the age-rated is the point that confirms this, but if you watched any other horror movie or even some heavier action movie (John Wick sent his regards), you won't be impersonated at all. It isn't the kind of k-drama that the romantic ones who just watch dramas because of their sweetness and softness would like. It is heavy, but nothing absurd to people above 16 who have a clear mind at the moment. So, if you are passing through something heavy in your life and don't feel comfortable watching violent scenes or a dystopic story, save this for later or for never. I just watched because I was feeling okay, but I would wait for sure if it was a few weeks ago.

I'm doing this review more like an alert because the internet is full of reviews and comments about it. My considerations are: The story is amazing. The performances are incredible. I don't know if I want a second season. If you have children, don't let them watch it. Even if your kid is pretty mature, that are some things that they don't need to watch, and the age-rated is made for this.

This is a chosen one (★ ★ ★ ★ ★★ ★ ★ ★ ★) for sure, and now I'll come back to my silly romances until the blood dries out of my brain.

See you soon!
XOXO, Mari.

Disturbing? Yes. But I just know we're all simping for Sae-byeok.
If I was just going off the title and didn't see the poster, I would be so disturbed by this show that I wouldn't be able to sleep for a few days.

Let's dissect the story. I love how it not only quickly introduces the main character, but also briefly brings up the other few main characters all within the first episode. It is fast-paced, and it brings about a new 'topic' every few episodes -- though not disconnected. The one thing that prevented it from having a 9/10 was the ending. It is the typical Netflix Original ending, as with Love Alarm, Extracurricular, and Vagabond; it gives you that unsettling ending that makes you long for a season 2 or explanation.

Let's now talk about the cast. I didn't really like the main character, but mostly because I couldn't relate with his character. His actor, Lee Jung Jae, did an amazing job portraying his desperation and poorness. As for all the side characters, I think I really fell in love with Sae-byeok and Ha Joon. Sae-byeok's role and her scene with Ji Yeong really made me cry; I always remember scenes and characters that make me cry. As for Ha Joon, I was just always a fan of the actor that played him. Unless there is a season 2, I don't really get the significance of his character at the moment though.

Overall, I would RECCOMEND this drama--but do not watch if you are looking for wholesome or romantic content.

Squid Game?? More Like Death Games
Squid Game was truly something else. I expected a bunch of games, but did I expect everything that happened during and after the games? No, definitely not. This obviously needs a season 2 since the ending was kind of crappy. Don't get me wrong, the beginning and the show in general was excellent. However, I wish the ending was a little more developed.

Seong Gi Hoon was an interesting character. He was naïve of a sort, even though he was been through a lot. Even after what happened at the end, he continued to live his life the way it was before. Cho Sang Woo honestly did not deserve to last so long in the games. This man was dangerous and we couldn't even detect it. Kang Sae Byeok was the best character, hands down. She faced everything head-on which is something I want to do whenever I'm in the middle of a situation. Hwang Jun Ho was pretty irrelevant in my opinion because his purpose was to only find his brother who went missing. The hot thing about him was that he always used the words of someone whenever he was ""violated"". There's no closure about him, which I wish did happen. Hopefully in season 2, we'll get closure about him. Ali was too innocent in this drama. All he wanted was money for his wife and kid, poor guy couldn't even get anything, but he left his family a good amount. Oh Il Nam...I don't know, I have a confusing view about him. He treated the guys so nice, but at the end what he explained was messed up. Ji Yeong was also badass, her ending is undeserved, she deserved a second chance.

There's a bunch of other characters I would have reviewed, but meh it's whatever lol

WOW!
The show was AMAZING! the way I was crying for characters I have only known them for 1-4 episodes is just crazy cause this is the first time it has happened to me. The way they have developed the characters even if we don't know that much about their background other than gi-hun but honestly, they never tell us anything like why he debt or any other information, so it's crazy how i started crying, this also just proves how the acting is just amazing and i loved the cast and they fit so well with the roles and the chemistry with each other was amazing too! Also, i was so happy seeing a south asian character because it's not very common to see them and even if you do see them they are small roles no main characters so I WAS VERY VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT me being an indian myself. The music was also so good, the song matched the vibe so well such as when they played happy songs in bad situations it really matched well with the children's game theme or the pink soldiers song gave such an eerie vibe but i kept wanting to listen to the song even though it kinda freaked me out a little. Lastly, i loved the story so much but if I'm going to be honest, the story was pretty basic but it was still so addicting and i binged the whole show in one sitting so i still TOTALLY RECCOMED WATCHING!

i love this show so much and I'm SO HAPPY FOR THE SHOW AND THE ACTORS FOR ALL THE INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION THIS SHOW IS GETTING AND OTHER KDRAMAS SUDDENLY GETTING AFTER SQUID GAME... LIKE THE STORIES ARE SO GOOD THEY DESERVE IT!! YAYYYY!!

Why would a Goodie do-Gooder go back to the sloutherhouse?
Normally I don't watch romance-less thriller kdramas, because they almost always suck. They are often full of immersion breaking sloppy writing and have many incredibly silly scenes. I feel that Squid Game certainly has them both. The characterization of the ML and of quite a few other contestants had some major problems. Personally I always hated it, when a random moron wins against smarter, more motivated opponents in a setting like this, however the ML's actions often felt arbitrary, beyond just an idiot's actions. Then again the whole thing is FULL of plotholes at the fundamental level, so the players frequently acting out of character is not even the biggest problem here, although Cho Sang Woo's death is just ridiculously stupid. All that he has sacrificed to win, for THAT to end up happening, well done! (evilME would have just thrown the knife for W45.000.000.000) Also what's the deal with the policeman's plotline, is there really a point beyond giving mental demons to his brother in season2?

The ending is trash of course, the minor cliffhanger is so bad that it's difficult to put into words. The final post-game twist is almost intelligence insulting too, especially considering how I went back and looked at what happened before frame by frame and it just doesn't make any sense. (pink solder raised the gun > the camera moved out of sight > boom > back in sight > man seemingly down) This is a preproduced drama and all the episodes were released on the same day, so the assumption that the audience would just forget about past details is just wrong.

The base ideas behind the show are pretty good, I guess the creator took Liar Game as the main inspiration & borrowed some ideas from Hunger Games and other Battle Royale titles. Mixing all that up with Korean children's games worked a lot better than I thought it possibly could have.
It's rare that a Korean TV show has one person as the director and the screenwriter. Hwang Dong Hyuk may have done a pretty bad job as a writer, but as a director I can only praise him. It's incredible how he succeeded to make the MOST BORING GAMES EVER exciting on TV. I found the tug of war game especially impressive. I have played tug of war many times & also I have seen tug of war on Running Man countless times, I have never thought rope pulling could be this exciting..

The best things about the show are of course the incredible sets, the symbology, the OST and the incredible cinematography.
I think the art director may have contributed more to this show's success than the director/screenwriter himself. I may have disliked many things about this show, but there were moments here and there, when I felt almost astonished at what I was seeing on screen. I do understand why Squid Game has become a worldwide sensation.

People talk about this show being the big hit it is, because of the human side of it, due to all the social interactions the contestants had with each other between the games. I'm not sure if I agree, most characters could not have been more two dimensional. Though certainly the actors did an excellent job showing a wide array of authentic emotions.

-
Most English speaking characters were cringeworthy as usual. They could have done much better in that regard, considering it's a Netflix production. The silly dubbed accents were not even the worst part, but rather the whole VIP member commentary in the last 2 episodes could not have been more out of place.
--
If we consider kdrama a genre, not just ""korean made TV drama"", then Squid Game is not a kdrama. It breaks several kdrama taboos, such as it has a Hollywood like explicit sex scene (not counting the gay foreigner thing), a lot of blood & most importantly the main characters are not astonishingly beautiful people. Personally I don't particularly mind, I'm just a little surprised by it all. I guess this is a real Netflix production with the western audiences in mind, perhaps Korea only embraced it, because it has become a huge worldwide sensation.

THANKS FOR PLAYING WITH ME
Squid Game was an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. It's definitely something you could finish in one day if you were willing to give up that much time, but I think you'll find yourself getting sucked pretty easily into this cutthroat death game that also serves as a critique on capitalism.

First and foremost, I need to talk about the characters, or more specifically the participants of the game, because they were definitely a driving force in this story. Even though the time spent with each character varied, I still thought that most of them were really well-written and were able to provide a huge impact on the overall story. Each one had justification for participating in this game and I didn't find any of their actions to be overly forced. I found myself rooting for a majority of characters, and when each of them was killed off, it definitely struck an emotional blow. These are definitely not the usual 2-dimensional stock characters that are written into survival stories that we often see today. It was also really interesting to see how the different characters changed over the course of the game due to moral decay, or in some cases, didn't change at all, which helped to further the show's illustration of capitalism.

This then brings me on to the next thing I'd like to talk about, which is Squid Game's stance on capitalism. They pretty much nailed their argument against it, which basically boils down to: there is no equality under capitalism, and the poor will always suffer for the sake of the rich. The people who were running the game kept on stressing that the rules for each game were created in order to be fair for everyone and that every player would be given an equal chance to win, but it's also important to keep in mind that the reason these games were started in the first place was for the entertainment of the rich. There was never any equality to begin with because it was their poor status that placed them there in the first place.

The characters were also supposedly given the option of participating or not participating in the games, but in reality, just like with capitalism, there was actually no choice. Even though the people who were controlling the game insisted each player was there because it was their own decision, we're actually shown that these characters have literally nothing to lose. Nothing could be worse than the hellish situation they were placed in because of their debts under capitalism. It was only an illusion of free will, and ultimately, the choice was already made for them. This is an exceptionally well-crafted representation of how capitalism works. You have to participate in this rotten system in order to survive, and if you don't, you're basically deemed as having little to no value and are seen as less than a human being and basically become forced into poverty.

And even if you think you have a chance at beating this corrupt system, it doesn't come without a cost. No one becomes a millionaire or a billionaire without stepping on other people. There is no ethical way of achieving that status of wealth. Squid Game brilliantly illustrates this point by setting up the games in such a way that you can only win at the expense of other people's lives. Every dollar that was added to that heinous piggy bank represents the value that was attached to the life of every player who died. Specifically, players who were poor and impoverished and were only playing this game in order to pay off their debts. Capitalism strikes again by forcing poor people to compete with each other in order to survive and make a living, all the while the ultra-rich get to kick back and enjoy the show. There were lots of moments that were truly sickening to watch, but unfortunately, they are pretty accurate in regards to how a capitalistic society functions. The poor stay poor and the rich get richer.

Okay. Rant finished. I'd like to point out that I also highly enjoyed the production, acting, and music of Squid Game. It was all extremely well-executed and helped to add to the intensity of the show.

However, I did not like the ending. It felt like the writers were really building up to this big, grand conclusion, but instead, we were given an ending that was underwhelming, and quite frankly, didn't make much sense. It also seemed to undermine a lot of the character's actions from beforehand, so I was pretty frustrated with it.

Overall, I still pretty much enjoyed the show up until the ending. I kind of went into this with pretty low expectations if I'm being honest, so I was pleasantly surprised. If you're looking for a good show with lots of action but isn't mindless and cheap in the slightest, I would definitely give Squid Game a chance. It definitely deserves all the attention it is receiving since its Netflix release, and I hope that it can really help to pave the way for people to reconsider their beliefs about capitalism as we know it, as well as to help encourage Western audiences to branch out more when it comes to the kinds of media they consume. As director Bong Joon-Ho said while accepting an Oscar for his film Parasite, “Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."" I think Squid Game's popularity will help more people realize the meaning behind this sentiment.

Suspenseful
Oct. 2, 2021

Squid Game is one of those dramas where humans are in such a desperate state that they have lost their ability to have human compassion. To be honest, I really love the first half of the series. I am assuming that there must be a plan for a second season as the ending implied it unless they really wanna fk us up and give that ending with no sequel.

For the characters of the Squid Game, I think that the writers really gave us a huge variety of personalities and perspectives through each ones. Though, there are some characters that I absolutely despised and thank god they are gone. But I fking hate those VIPs. I need them dead, I don't think I will be able to rest and I will not continue to shut up unless those mfs get their deserved karma for using people for their fking entertainment.

With all these, I did feel a bit underwhelmed with the latter half of season 1. I feel like the writing has become sloppy and that it kinda fell into the constant repetition that made it a bit harder to finish the series. I did skip multiple scenes in the latter half as it seems uninteresting and unnecessary. I did cry for all the characters that I loved since they all really just died. Like damn, that hurt like a bitch tbh. I wished they kept my girl like come on. But oh well, it is what it is.

A strong impact on audience
** Note : I've already watched them 2 or 3 weeks back . But , I'm just writing the review because I was pretty free and suprisingly not having house chores . **

As I finished Squid Game last weekend I saw that it was # 1 on Netflix. On my tiny little island of all places. Just a couple of years ago people scoffed at me when they found out I was watching kdramas. Squid Game is basically just a korean movie that has been extended to 9 episodes and in many ways I think it is a very typical gory and violent story that you often find in Korean movies. Something that has been slowly finding its way into Korean television in recent years, especially with shows produced by Netflix. And it is clear that a lot was put into this series from what it’s visuals, to the choice of actors and the budget etc.

As I said Squid Game was a bit of a typical story from this type of entertainment that you often find in movies from countries like Japan and Korea (like Battle Royal) and for me it was not that original with them and neither did they do something new with this type of narrative. Which may be why there was very little to the story that actually surprised me. even if I really enjoyed watching it. I found it a bit typical and it mainly just reminded me of other such stories that have come before it.

The violence is not for everyone. I can stomach quite a bit of it without it bothering me. I often think the violence in this type of stories goes a little too far but there is a purpose to it in some ways and the story puts a lot of pressure on your endurance as a spectator, because that is the purpose of it. It’s hard for the characters, it should be hard on you. You can hardly look away even if you want to and that is one of the traits of these types of stories. And in that Squid Game is very successful.

The story starts off with a bang, but after that is does take it’s time to find it’s footing but when it manages it toward the middle part the show becomes really binge-able, before taking a slight dip towards the end. The theme of the effects of late stage capitalism and it’s grip on our society and the situation that has created among us is very interesting and the story does a good job underlining that.

Really good amount of suspense going on there and some good character moments in between them, although I thought the story never really took full advantage of it’s characters as it spent more time on other aspects of the story. It was also a little too noticeable to me that this was written by a man based on how some of the characters were written and it bothered me a bit. I think the choice of actors, who are all great, made the character more interesting than they might be.

I felt the ending was a little too empty which slightly made the ride on this roller-coaster of a story slightly less thrilling. It didn’t leave that much behind. I felt I was missing some emotional payoff from the story. I felt like the personal journey was a bit lacking in the end so it didn’t stick the landing. And I didn’t feel like enough questions were answered in the narrative. It was as if the story was relaying little too much getting another series. And I appreciate kdrams for giving me complete stories in one season.

This is a nine-part gory Korean film. It really felt like it was made with that sort of target audience in mind; those who really enjoy this genre of Korean and Japanese films (as this is one of the most popular genres of Asian films in the west, which I sometimes find a bit sad but I also understand the appeal). It’s good gory entertainment and I can see why it is as popular as it is. It’s thrilling, violent and addictive while it’s going on but it didn’t leave me with much in the end except maybe blood and gore.

Great start and mediocre ending
The ending of the kdrama kind of felt meh compared to the rest of the episodes. Rushed explanations that were unsatisfying (regarding the old man) and the delayed help that GiHun should've given to the family members. There are a lot of plot lines to still develop, the police story line and GiHun trying to take down the operation. It's clear that they wanted to make a season 2 with this show. But that may have affected the quality of the ending for this season.

Nevertheless, it's an interesting dive into the morality and extremes that humans are willing to go for their own survival and desires. At what point do crossing those lines become too much? It had compelling side characters as well, SaeByeok was my absolute favorite with her backstory and characterization. I'm sad about what happened to her. The subplot with the police story line was most intriguing and I look forward to that development in the next season the most.

This series was an okay one. The type of series you'd want to binge rather than drag watching because every scene was immersive. I really enjoyed watching it and at the same time, I'm so nervous every time they would start playing the next game which we'd have to guess what. The production was huge and well-prepared. The characters, aka those staff of the game, were really unique looking with their masks and outfit. The acting was also effective; I really hated some characters and sympathize with some. I just don't know what's lacking in this series for me to say that it was quite enjoyable but not a favourite. Overall a good watch though. If you're looking for a thriller k-series and wouldn't be bothered with brutality, then this one might be for you.

A Recommended Watch - Especially for the Acting
This series has a little bit of everything - good and less-than.

I think the premise is relatively standard. It's a survival horror/death game type deal, however, with the participants being there of their own free will. Yes, even after the killing starts. The team does a very good job of building the tension during the first half, but as the number of participants decreases, so does the coherency of the plot. I think this drama could have used a couple of more episodes, maybe 2-3 more, to progress and conclude the plot better. There are a lot of the participants who have interesting backstories and possibilities for torture. What about the married couple who had decided to join? There could have been plenty more scenes showing the pain characters like them would have felt. The husband is forced to kill his wife in one of the games, and we see nothing of it? How can you leave something like that out? What about Mi Nyeo who has a baby? It's mentioned twice and never addressed again. The doctor harvesting organs? What was that about?

The story gives a lot of focus on the main three characters, but even that isn't a lot. But how can you give any more depth when you have so little time to do it? Gi Hoon and Sae Byeok definitely get the most development. Sang Woo is rather quickly made out to be a manipulative villain, and it never goes beyond that. Gi Hoon and Sang Woo's past seems so dishonest when you know how SW is. SW's betrayal feels genuinely weak, because the viewer already knew what kind of person he was.

At times, I feel like the production team was so obsessed with making this big story, that they sacrificed the plot and characters along the way. Everything just feels rushed and sort of incomplete. There are certain times where an incomplete story works out really well, but here it just seems lacking. Sure, there are some tragic deaths in this, but they just did not have the impact they'd have if you knew the characters a little better. The B-plot, even with it's lacks, was actually a lot more interesting to me than the A-plot.

Of course, I can't leave out the things I liked: The casting and acting is AMAZING. I love how the different characters interact with one another, and how everyone bond over their shared situation. But they were still different from one another. Some are in debt because they're shitty people, and some are just trying to save their loved ones. It makes for an interesting dynamic. The actors go all out, and I love it. Especially Mi Nyeo - I love how unhinged she is. Big kudos to the amazing actress. Everyone is great in this, no matter their role.

I also want to mention the set design. I normally hate the survival game genre for how boringly realistic it can be. However, I adore the visual theme that was used for this drama. The bright colors, and the focus on children's playgrounds really emphasizes the disparity between the basic premise of the games, and what actually goes on in them. I mean, the people betting on the players are supposed to be having fun, so of course the surroundings should be fun looking!

As I said in the beginning, this series has it's good and not-so-good sides, but I definitely feel that they are worth living with. I do recommend watching this series, especially for the characters and acting. If there will be a season 2, I'll be looking forward to see how some of the unanswered questions are dealt with. If there won't be a continuation, I won't be disappointed. I'm content either way.

I NEED A SEASON 2!
Squid game was amazing. I loved how the characters progressed along the way. I honestly haven't cried like this, never. Especially because of a series. Episode six was pure hell tbh, I got to see people's true colors.

The acting and cast was awesome too. They really chose the best actors :')

Music was nice, yes.

Def going to rewatch it!

Overall, this series was amazing. I can't wait for a season 2, I hope they show how the workers started working there too! I loved the ending, we got to see some humanity. Although it was sad that he didn't see his daughter, I think that sacrificing something for the greater good is awesome.

Average for it's genre.
Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty decent show. But at the same time the ending didn't satisfied me at all.
It ended like this in order to have more seasons ofc but idk... for me it lacked smt.

Survival movies or tv shows are never a concept i find revolutionary, so i think it's pretty funny how of all the kdramas out there, this one is the most watched on Netflix. Not only that but it's the TOP2 most watched shows on Netlix of all time.
I understand everything and all that, but if i ever survived such a crazy hell i would either end up killing myself regardless or just really living and doing everything i've ever wanted. Might as well... what's the worst that can happen?

yeah. Worth the hype.
I wasn't wowed by the first episode of this drama, nor entirely enchanted by the second. But by the end of the second episode I thought... dang, okay, fine, I guess I want to keep watching. And I'm glad I did.
The most thrilling and emotional parts of this show took place within the game itself. The games are simple children's games, but are games that don't necessarily require skill. Most of the time, it's luck; which number you drew, which shape you got, that sort of thing. The game purports to be 'fair', but it's only fair in the way that real life is fair. You're stuck with the cards you've been given. The poor characters take part in the game because the real world is so terrible for them that the game is the best alternative they've got. Sadly, some even think they can win, despite (as we've discussed) the games being largely luck-based.
The characters are mostly pretty decent in this. The main character, Gi Hoon, is initially kind of a piece of trash, but you realize that he's a gambling addict, and this leads to him hurting the people he loves. He's not an inherently bad person who wants to hurt others, and you see that come out in the game, where he's one of the kinder people there. The rest of the cast are also great, not a weak performance in sight. I'd say the cop's plotline and character are mildly confusing and vague and you're just not that emotionally invested in it compared to everyone else. The show continues to get better and better as the games keep going and people die.
People die in very emotionally impacting ways, and I think they did all the character deaths very well. They often feel different too; whether it's because it was accidental, somebody cheated so they lost, or just bad luck. And the deaths can weirdly almost feel like a part of their character arcs. I don't know how the writers pulled it off but they did it well.
tl;dr it's really worth watching because it's not just trashy fun, it has so much to say about the unfairness of the systems in this world that keep poor people down. I'm not sure I'd rewatch it because it's so emotionally overwhelming at times but it is super good.

Desperate Times Call for Desperate Measures or do they?
I really liked how this showed some realities of the lengths that people would go for the allure of money. Yes, even risking their lives despite not knowing much of what would happen with each game.

Each game really kept one at the edge of their seat or hugging a pillow as I did for the most part of this show. I think a reason why this is a show that is really trending is not just the story line which is really well-written by the way, it is also because of how the different characters are portrayed. You see their backstories and understand the desperation that fuels their drive to complete each game. Kudos to the actors who really did a good job at making us love or hate their character!

Something I didn't like though was how they made me think differently of the waltz that I used to dance to. Hehe. All in all, it was a good show although I don't think I can handle watching it again unlike with Alice in Borderland for some reason.

Current rating is spot on
I don't normally trust the rating here in MDL because we all have different preference but this time i do agree that this series is good but not so great.

I like the first episode. It left a lasting impression similar to the Titanic movie where the band kept playing while the ship was sinking. It was captivating and sad.

The story is like building a matchstick tower, there's a feeling of fear and excitement as you build up hoping that you'll be able to use your last matchstick without it collapsing. But the storyline were not able to hold its standing. It eventually collapse in the end and did not meet the expectations of a good ending. The main game was ruined by too much talk and less play time. Well, good luck to season 2 where matchstick building will start again.

The main lead is too much, his acting is OTT and you can't feel his sincerity. Whereas Park Hae-Soo and Ho Yeon Jung played their role brilliantly.

Cinematography and music are in sync to the storyline. Overall, its a good watch but except for the first episode, i don't think i will watch it again.

“Winner!”
Synopsis: A story about cash-strapped contestants competing in children’s games with only 2 outcomes - either $38M in cash or death in a flash.

If you’re browsing audience reviews to decide whether or not to watch this Netflix exclusive then my quick answer is, “Yes, go for it!” If you want to know the reasons why then read on:

1. Ranked # 1 in the list of Netflix’s most popular shows in 90 countries.
2. Insane plot initially conceptualized in 2008 but rejected several times for more than a decade eventually turning into a worldwide phenomenon, is enough to stir up anybody’s curiosity.
3. Brilliant multitasker Hwang Dong Hyuk was both the writer and director so nothing was “lost in translation”, enabling the storyline to be directly translated into actions and emotions just as it had been intended by the original storyteller.
4. Superb acting all around, from the lead characters to the supporting cast, even the cameo roles. It did not matter whether they are seasoned actors or rookies, superstars or not so well-known. Their acting talents were all at par. Their competencies were same level. And just how impressive were they? Well for one, Ho Yeon Jung, a first-time actress with a following of 400K on Instagram pre-Squid Game era is currently the most followed Korean actress with 23.7M followers, and counting! If her acting was lackluster or lame then these 23 million new fans of hers wouldn’t have clicked “Follow” on social media. *Note: There is an exception to this praiseworthy acting group which is explained below.
5. Captivating set design and enthralling art direction with minimal use of CGI for a more realistic and riveting effect.
6. Gruesome, grotesque and gory scenes are not really my thing but somehow the treatment of these scenes was done in a creatively tricky and insidious way so they did not make me shut my eyes in fear nor give me nightmares at night.
7. Bizarre oxymoron with the most extreme contradictions. How can seemingly harmless children’s games be played with blatantly harmful results? How can an innocent looking doll cause carnage or a whimsical playground transform into a bloodbath? Quite disturbing, nonetheless, impactful.
8. Genius musical score using familiar classical music to tone down the shock factor. Instead of hearing suspenseful tones as a warning that something dreadful is about to happen you hear soothingly nostalgic melodies such as “Fly Me To The Moon”. Weird, but somehow it worked brilliantly.
9. Not annoyingly commercialized with no glaring product placements nor subliminal endorsements. Even the actors’ length of screen time was not exploitative. Those in the superstar level like Gong Yoo and Lee Byung Hun had minimum exposure, while neophytes Ho Yeon Jung and Anupam Tripathi were highly visible. The creators did not have to heavily rely on A-listers to gain widespread popularity.
10. In spite it being a purely Korean presentation there were ironically no communication and cultural barriers which brought about its global appeal. It vividly showcased how human frailties and imperfections bear no nationality.

Now for the constructive criticisms:

1. Illogical instances when the players were demanding the guards to implement fairness and show compassion such as allowing them to use the toilet during bedtime or stopping contestants embroiled in a fist fight. How can they expect civility and morality in a place where wanton killings were casually occurring on a daily basis?
2. VIPs’ contrived dialogues; the fake and forced delivery of their lines made me cringe and wonder if the reason why they were wearing elaborate masks was to hide their identities with all that shameful acting. The otherwise meticulous Korean director should have hired English speaking advisers who could have provided him with feedback as to how unnatural the foreign actors sounded.
3. Unrealistic ending where the protagonist suddenly became pious and honorable after a lifetime of wayward and contemptible behavior. After all the trouble (and near-death experiences) he went through, he decides not to savor his reward. Spending $10 out of a $38M jackpot did not make absolute sense!

Final verdict: 10 positives versus 3 negatives is still a WIN.

You need to be a zombie to enjoy this
Whew! Watching this is like doing an unwanted chore. Such a waste of opportunity!

After saving it in my to-watch list the first day I saw the trailer on Netflix, I cleared my Friday night schedule to binge all the episodes, prepared my popcorn, (and beer) popped the first episode and I'm hooked! The first episode was compelling and was such a gorefest, I thought it is exactly how I want my horror show. The very first attack by the school nurse was heartstopping and showed a lot of promise. Sadly, after the 3rd episode, I am snoozing like a baby, drools and all.

My expectations are low when it comes to horror. I come to be entertained and have a good time, and the more gruesome and the more bloody the better. Having said that, I have set my bar even lower for this series because I know it's teen-centric and I just want to enjoy and not nitpick details. This show, however, exceeded in delivering mind-numbing foolishness, and it's so easy to hate almost all characters that you can't stop wishing all of them would just be bitten.

The story is simple enough but could have been a goldmine of ideas and exciting scenarios. Instead, they dropped stupid and repetitive scenarios one after another. The character's eyes keep popping like a light bulb every time they think (or they think they thought of) of brilliant ideas to outsmart the zombies. You just can't help but cheer the zombies to finally have a go at it and just kill the characters:
1. One of the most frustrating is the way they handled Ohn Jo's father, they were building the story for him to be the big rescuer, and that he will do everything to save his daughter only to die minutes after reuniting with her. We were shouting at the screen when that happened cause they all clearly have a path to get away from the zombies, especially right after when he threw the first flare because it seems they can all go safely, Then, he unnecessarily threw the second and third flares. Very anti-climatic for his arc just to create the drama.
2. Seems like they were intent on just unnecessarily killing all the adults alive in the school to keep the narrative that the teens are on their own.
3. The vlogger was just a nuisance. I don't understand his importance to the story cause he did nothing at all.
4. Do I need to mention Chiong San's mom? What about his dad who mysteriously disappeared?
5, The police force. My goodness! I love Lee Kyu Hyung and even if his character here was almost the same as in Happiness, he is still also one of the few bright spots of the series. However, the whole Hyosan police force was just a dimwit bunch. Did you see how easy it was for the zombies to overrun the friggin police headquarters? The guys at the school put up a much better fight than these weakling cops. They got the main culprit -the brain behind the virus and they know the virus is spreading and you interrogate him like it's a normal crime? Has no one there thought of coordinating with the other agencies, and telling them that they have the crazy scientist, turn him over and make him do the antidote or something. No, they all panicked when the zombies attacked the police station, no one even thought of maybe finding some weapons because just maybe there are some because THEY ARE IN THE FRIGGIN POLICE STATION!
6. What about the assemblywoman? What's her actual contribution to the whole story?
7. Did you see how the teen mom tied her hands with that ribbon, to keep her from eating the baby? She's a zombie, not a gift box, that ribbon looks so thin that when she became a zombie she could have snapped it easily. Oh but that ribbon is made of steel and it held her overnight. And that baby? It must have superhuman powers to survive that long without milk.
8. The bullied girl in the rooftop. I was thinking they'd give her a recovery arc, but no, she is just as self-centered as her bullies. She was so happy to announce that she SET THE SCHOOL ON FIRE, but girl has to check that statement cause all she did was burn the papers in the office, nothing more. Hasn't she seen the fire sprinklers working? A fight between her and GwiNam could have been epic.
9. And OMG that bullied guy. I kinda understand why he did what he did on the rooftop, but then he was at the camp, met this girl, and he tells him I want to eat you, and then he just let her. That scenario alone could have opened a lot of possible chaotic scenarios inside the camp. I was kinda expecting the zombies to spread there, but no, nothing of that sort. It's like the guy's existence is just to make the abandonment of the kids in the rooftop climatic, which by the way is not.
10. I would like to mention the countless stupid ways to escape a zombie apocalypse but this is already way too long.

They even spent almost an episode literally talking about shit. They complained about thirst and hunger but didn't bother to find food and water and yet they spent quite some time teaching us how to do the number 2 during an apocalypse.

What makes it sadder, is that I find not a single character to latch on to - not the drama queen, not her puppy best friend, not the pretend goody goody jock, not even the smartass who could have been their gifted savior. What they delivered instead was a puke-invoking bunch of whiny pimpled teenage characters who can't stop talking about their silly crushes and quite a few useless adult characters who makes selfish and terrible decisions.

There are only two characters I didn't hate- Gwi Nam is a scary psycho and the funny delinquent Mi-Jin. Had they shifted the focus to these two, they could have created a witty frightening gore. I just have to add that my favorite part was when they were on the rooftop and singing cause that felt sincere.

I can't help but wonder why this show got a 12-episode order as opposed to Kingdom which has 6 per season and Sweet Home which has 10. The show could have used a lot of editing and maybe it will feel better if it was just 8 or even 10.

I recommend having a go at it using your mobile device, that way you can change the playback speed, otherwise, if you're watching on your smart tv just have the remote ready and just feel free to skip the boring parts. I promise you, you won't miss anything. Hard to rewatch, unfortunately.

Dying is easy, surviving is hard
All of Us Are Dead is adapted from the serialized Naver digital webtoon entitled Now at Our School, which was written by Joo Dong Geun and published from 2009 to 2011. I haven’t read the webtoon but it reportedly consists of only nine chapters. Therefore it would probably stand to reason that the live-action adaptation has expanded on its lore, especially when Netflix is involved where the potential exists for a series to be renewed for a second season, depending on the success of the first season.

The drama is co-directed by Lee Jae Gyoo, who won a Baeksang for Damo and directing honours for Beethoven Virus, and Kim Nam Soo. It is based on the screenplay adaptation written by Cheon Seong Il, the screenwriter for Chuno and The Pirates. Principal photography took place from June 2020 to February 2021, which was prolonged due to the Covid-19 outbreak during filming.

In a nutshell, the story revolves around a group of highschool students who are trapped at their school, the ground zero for the onset of a zombie virus outbreak. The drama depicts them fighting to survive both the zombies and virus infection while waiting to be rescued. The rating classification for this production is R-18 and aside from the expected zombie action and gore, certain trigger warnings are present in the form of bullying violence that even borders on sexual assault.

In a recent interview with director Lee Jae Gyoo via the online presentation of the production in South Korea on 26th January, he had intimated that this drama would be uniquely distinct within the K-drama zombie genre that has become commonplace in recent years. According to him, All of Us Are Dead features thought-provoking themes that add a different meaning to a zombie apocalypse, where the focus is on the choices young students make at the boundary between life and death. In addition, the story also provides a satirical take on South Korea's educational system and school space.

What I Liked

I love the K-drama zombie genre and anything closely or even remotely associated in the form of mutants, monsters and the like, complete with the horror, action, adventure tags whether in contemporary, sageuk or fantasy settings. As much as I’ve enjoyed the recently aired Happiness, my preference for zombies leans towards the more feral variety with hordes of them rampaging through the populace annihilating anything and everything in their path, in the mould of Train to Busan (which gets a shoutout in this drama), Kingdom and Rampant. Call me sadistic but I’m all for epic levels of productions with economies of scale in delivering the exhilaration of the action, thrills and suspense, along with all the emotive aspects of human drama as well. Based on what I’ve seen of the depiction of zombies in this drama, it manages to convey all of the above, and has successfully fulfilled most, if not all, of my expectations.

A co-production between JTBC Studios’ Film Monster and Kim Jong Hak Production for Netflix, the quality of the technical execution is beyond doubt. No effort or budget was spared as even a huge four-storey set was constructed as the setting of the fictional Hyosan High School. The money was very well spent indeed as the production design looks top notch with all the nitty gritty details providing an intriguing backdrop to the zombie outbreak. The zombies themselves are deftly manifested in terms of the makeup, special and sound effects, as well as the blood, gore and contortions which complement the extensive range of expertly choreographed sequences.

The cinematography is deserving of praise with the crucial aspect for productions of this nature being the calibre of the camerawork, which for the most part does not let me down (or induce nausea). The well rendered scene transitions are testament to the standard of editing as well, where it’s worth mentioning that the chaotic scenes at the cafeteria and library involving 200 or so extras are reportedly the result of a single-take shooting.

As far as the narrative is concerned, the premise of a school-based zombie outbreak is refreshingly new to me. Some viewers may associate elements of Dark Hole to be of similar vein but personally it really isn’t despite the comparable vibes. While I wouldn’t consider the overall plot trajectory as particularly inventive or groundbreaking, what distinguishes this drama from most others that I’ve seen is the storytelling approach.

In addition to the multiple POV perspectives of the main characters, the screenplay takes its time to explore the origins of the zombie outbreak and motivations behind the actions resulting in the said virus being unleashed on humanity. The depiction of characters dealing with the tragic circumstances in the aftermath certainly elicits an emotional response as well.

True to the director's word, this drama tackles both existing and hypothetical societal concerns which provide added dimensions to the storytelling. Among the thought provoking themes incorporated into the storytelling - unchecked and unmitigated school violence, the ingrained hierarchical social order within a society segmented by wealth and power, the deeply polarised mindsets of the local government and communities in the event of an apocalypse or the aftermath of a mass casualty event. The role that technology plays in binding all these themes together is tackled as well in the form of the ever increasing reliance on and abuse of social media as an outlet that fuels the dissemination of actual and fake news.

The infusion of a number of side stories, character arcs and a narrative that steadily evolves as the drama progresses helped to allay my initial concerns of the story sustaining its momentum over 12 episodes. The dynamic between characters giving rise to various forms of conflicts, teen angst, and even hints of romance contribute towards preserving an atmosphere filled with tension and suspense. That said, I do think the drama could have been slightly shortened without adversely impacting the storytelling.

The main cast is made up of young actors, some of whom were prolific child actors and even critically acclaimed talent as well. Park Ji Hoo, Yoon Chan Young, Jo Yi Hyun, Park Solomon and Yoo In Soo portray the highschool students who are caught up in the ensuing chaos. Featuring roles of varying capacities, these youngsters provide a decent account of themselves through characterizations that are adequately written, for the most part. Lee Yoo Mi is particularly impressive here following her brief appearance in Squid Game, given her experience of being the oldest actress portraying a student and for her captivating portrayal of the antagonistic Lee Na Yeon that actually steals the scenes from the protagonists at times. Meanwhile, I would consider Park Solomon’s affable Lee Soo Hyuk, Jo Yi Hyun’s stoic Choi Nam Ra and Ha Seung Ri’s heroic archer Jang Ha Ri as my favourite characters amongst the students.

The supporting cast come across as being more familiar, where we get to observe Kim Byung Chul (Sisyphus, Doctor Prisoner), Lee Kyu Hyung (Happiness, Voice 4), Lee Yo Mi (Squid Game), Uhm Hyo Sub (King of Tears, War of the Son) , Bae Hae Seon (Happiness, Inspector Koo, HomeCha), Jeon Bae Soo (Stranger, Lawless Lawyer), Kim Jong Tae (The Veil, Sisyphus), and Yoon Byung Hee (Hot Stove League). The more nuanced acting in the drama is provided by these mostly experienced veterans, especially Kim Byung Chul as science teacher Lee Byeong Chan. Utterly intense, sinister, and convincing, unsurprisingly the best performance in the entire drama comes from this award-winning actor. Jeon Bae Soo gets to play the hero this time in a memorable performance as firefighter Nam So Ju.

What I Didn’t Appreciate

When it comes to K-dramas and school students, bullying and violence are par for the course - they’re never far away and will probably remain as a staple trope. It’s infuriating and disturbing to watch at times and seems to be escalating in brutality these days. The scale of the savagery seems to be higher than the actual zombie action itself but it’s something that all viewers of K-content will need to accept and get used to, unfortunately.

The main villain of the story is featured through the gangster wannabe and low-life bully Yoon Gwi Nam, played almost too well by Yoo In Soo. This despicable human thrash has the typical clichéd story arc that stretches far too long, in my opinion, before eventually fizzling out as a mere afterthought.

As mentioned earlier, I think the storytelling would have been better presented if it were slightly shorter, perhaps with 8 or so episodes.Despite the multiple POVs, too much time is allocated to the teen drama at school than is perhaps necessary. I would have liked to have seen Kim Byung Chul’s character more fleshed out in real time rather than merely as a series of flashbacks. The same goes for Jeon Bae Soo’s firefighter who is desperately trying to get to his daughter.

There are numerous annoying characters in this drama, some of whom supposedly supplying the usual ill-fitting comic relief that appears very much jarring to the senses.The tough girl wannabe and her whingeing companion, the cowardly police sergeant, and the bickering couples, to name a few. I think generally the boys are better written than the girls who come across as petty and physically abusive towards their male counterparts, as far as the youngsters are concerned.

Final Thoughts

All things considered and despite its flaws as well as the overly dramatic ending that has the potential for expansion either as a sequel or a side story, I had a great time mainly because of my love for horror and zombies. We honestly do need more zombie stories because there is too much romance, rom-coms and melodrama in dramaland already and simply not enough of the macabre flesh-eating, blood-sucking undead. All of Us Are Dead is not the best in the genre, where Kingdom still reigns supreme, but as a one-time weekend watch it definitely fulfils my insatiable hunger for such content, albeit temporarily.

ZZZZZombies
I've been waiting for this drama to air for an obscenely long time, I cleared my schedule today to fully binge this and I’ve got to say, I’m disappointed. There's a lot to be said and I’m sure some people enjoy it, but there's just very little to redeem the story and its ridiculous rabbit holes.

STORY
There's really nothing special about this story despite the fact the very idea of a zombie outbreak at a school gives a lot to work with. The writers stuff so many different plot points and social issues into the script and they're never fully elaborated on. But the worst thing is the fact the writers don't have something to say. Instead of the perceived problem of the message becoming too preachy, in a way common to the genre, there just seems to be no message at all. They touch on bullying, teen pregnancy, harassment, etc but there's nothing to be gained from it, you leave the viewing experience underwhelmed and slightly annoyed (especially because of the ending). There could've been many explorations in this story, a dive into pure human nature, an interesting perspective on strength, a deep look at grief. Instead, there are plot twists that make no sense, random characters and stories that have zero effect on the story, death without meaning, and repetitive plot points that leave you bored and exhausted. Some characters are interesting while others are one-note, with most characters having disappointing wrap-ups to their arcs/lives. Every aspect of the story is a complete letdown. It feels like the story writers missed an English class in 5th grade and forgot that every story needs to have a theme, subject, and message... My frustration really cannot be expressed properly, it is genuinely a shame.

ACTING
I'm going to link this acting and these characters together because in all honesty most of these characters are completely flat, we follow them for over 10 hours yet somehow know nothing about them or their motivations. But the cast! These kids are all wonderful, some of the side characters are uninteresting but even then their bonds with the mains and each other seem real and interesting, The main cast, especially Yoon Chanyoung, Yoo Insoo, and Jo Yihyun, are truly amazing, often showing up their older counterparts with the depth they managed to bring their characters. The true strength of this show is based entirely on how the actors managed to bounce off each other and deliver spectacularly when the camera decided to point at them. The show would be much worse off without this cast.

MUSIC/OTHER
I'm not an ost person so music has never had much of a deciding factor, the instrumentals were good if forgettable. I'd actually like to talk about the choreography of the fight scenes and visual effects. They were INCREDIBLE!! There were fight scenes in every episode and every one made use of beautiful staging techniques and were a delight to watch. The zombies ere really terrifying to see and the ever present threat was only heightened by the lovely special effects. The dance choreographers and VFX designers really delivered.

REWATCH VALUE
Like I said, there's really nothing of merit in the story and I feel like rewatching would make that even more pronounced.

OVERALL
To be honest I really wanted to love this drama. with everything in me I really did, but the plot and its meanderings are just really hard to bear... I really hope it does well though because this cast has some really special talent and id hate to see it go to waste.

Promising Outbreak but Questionable Ending
The premise of ""All of Us Are Dead"" like the korean title ""지금 우리 학교는"" or ""Our School Now"" is centered on students who tried their best to stay alive from being trapped in their school through zombie apocalypse. All of Us Are Dead has 12 episodes with 1 hour long duration. Some viewer might find the story dragging, but I didn't at all. How and why I find this drama fun and engaging? Mostly because I got to watch the story from several different perspective, desperate teen survivor, detective and his framed science teacher, also military and political government.

[ Promising Outbreak ]
Unlike most of zombie series that started with main character's everyday life and the sudden zombie outbreak, All of Us Are Dead began with the background story of the virus itself. The starting plot is around a student who get bullied and how this character developed the virus from his science teacher father who helped his own son from death. It is then unfold from his laboratory room and how the infected bring their zombie virus from inside and outside the school. I appreciated how the writer put the issue of school violence into the root of the zombie virus. The emotional story from the parents of surviving student was also my favorite. I always love how South Korean included 'heartwarming' family plot onto their series and ended it harshly for tearjerking scenes.

The story is shifted from time to time but it is all still connected into one because the school background setting is labeled ground zero for the outbreak. They blend the detective, military, and the political side into the story pretty well. We got to see the view on characters who truly wanted to help surviving people, who just wanted to save the non infected citizen, and who wanted to save their own ass on status seat even in harsh condition. Back to the main characters and their zombie battle at school. The main characters here are the surviving Hyosan Students, that funnily were all in the same class. What is the possibility of you and your classmates to survive together in zombie outbreak? This drama writer be like, ""Hell yeah, 99%. It is fiction so of course there would be impossible events, what would you expect?""

[ Questionable Ending ]
It wasn't an ideal one but I didn't know a better way to end this drama. The drama has an open ending like our real life Covid-19 situation, there is no light to see the end. I must mention i noticed there is some reference on ""Sewol Ferry"" accident in episode 12 where the survivors are being interrogated. If you don't know about it, try google search. It was heartbreaking real life tragedy of high school students who was abandoned by the official staff and government by leaving them drowning on sinking ferry. The student victims trusted the adults too much that they had to die in the end. So the dialogue ""Why did you abandon us?"" and ""I won't ask adults ever again, don't ask us to cooperate."" hit me in the feels. Not a perfect ending of course, afterall especially in our pandemic situation, which government have done a perfect job on taking care difficult problem? None.

But, how about the fantasy side from the virus and zombie? Yeah like when Nam Ra jumped from high school building, they once again left us with cliff hangers. I didn't get bothered by it, but I just wished to see more depth into their characters before the ending. What I find disappointing was how they started the 'virus making' well but they unfortunately leave the 'mutant making' with full of hanging reasons. There was definitely a chance for them to show more of background stories from Half Zombie characters ""The Bully Guy"", ""The Sexy Girl"", and ""The Students Pres"". Unfortunately we didn't get them until the end and we only could imagine and assume by ourselves.

[ Characters... Are Dead ]
I personally really hate the romance between main characters. It is as if they tell us, we have to crush on someone to be the main characters. Will it be okay without it? of course. If only their focus is more about friendship than love story, I think it will be more moving and affecting in a good way. Like my favorite scenes from the farewell between Cheong San and Gyeong Su, On Jo and Yi Sak throwback, and also Na Yeon character development story. I also find the supporting roles are more interesting, the two archery ladies, crybaby Na Yeon, chicken part timer wannabe Gyeong Sang, the realistic Ji Min, 2nd rank student ( i forgot his name ), the brother in law guy, and more! In comparison, the four main characters are more bland than the supporting characters to me.

Is their acting good enough? At first, both female lead actress looks awkward in my eyes, but they get better each episodes when they are mourning deaths and countering difficult situation. Male leads chemistry are the best, I like their bromance and I wish to see them in other projects. All of the supporting casts and the minor roles have amazing acting and they delivered their emotion admirably. I must mention the zombie stunt are perfect, plus point on cracking bones acting.

[ Zombies... Are Alive ]
Instead of creepy or dark atmosphere, All of Us Are Dead zombies are more gory full of blood ripped flesh and average people would find it disturbing. Most of them are executed on VFX and negative side we can actually notice it because the overall bright cinematography. There would be some plot hole in their action scenes and some people could get bothered by it. Like how the heck those zombie didn't get killed from third-floor fall but immediately died from a single arrow, but I personally didn't mind it because it was all for ""plot armour"" and just passed it by. I myself hardly get scared with zombie genre and I find most of the zombies here are hilarious. Believe me, I laughed a lot on suitcase, traffic cone, scissors, and kindergarten zombies. I repeated their scenes for comedic relief.

[ Music... Are Splashed Everywhere ]
I don't know what to say here. I don't remember any single background music in All of Us Are Dead and I just remember all the special sound effect of tearing flesh, splashing blood, and purking. But that is what made me focus on their action and dialogue between characters.

[ Overall... Watch it When You Are Alive ]
One you can expect from south korean zombie series is their focus on survival. I like this show from episode 1 to 12. It is a fun experience to see all perspective of students victim of harsh accident trying to get into safety in school area. There are a lot of cool extraordinary action scenes when they tried avoiding the zombies. The thrilling moments and in between relief of breath are exciting for me. The overall cinematography are also excellent, they have this green color grading perfect for image's depth, contrast, and contour to support the story's atmosphere. The behind production team is top notch. I didn't read this drama webtoon because I didn't want to get disappointed like I did with Sweet Home. That was my choice and I think that was the best decision for me. Because in the end, I mostly enjoyed All of Us Are Dead from the beginning until the end.

Is it more than your regular Zombie drama?
Zombie dramas have its own fan-base. You either like such gore dramas or hate them. Of-course it is the story that matters at the end of the drama. I feel that the suddenness of a zombie popping out of places you least expect from and the survivors instinct of the dramas cast makes it thrilling for the viewers.
Coming back to the 'All of us are dead' drama. I was waiting for this drama for a long time and I binged watched the entire drama as soon as it came in my country. Even though the drama had its fair share of plot holes and a not so likeable Main FL the drama was a one hell of a thrilling ride. And what I loved is its long list of good actors in it. At points the decision made by the student may seem immature but we have to keep in mind that they were only high school students. It is thrilling to watch them trying to stay alive between a horde of zombies. The drama started as your regular high school bullying drama but it quickly changed gears. The story was pretty fast moving too and it never felt dull at a long interval. I feel that the first half of the drama was far better than the second half pf the drama.
Between all blood and death also there were some nice characters to watch. Namely Lee Cheong San, Song Jae Ik [Detective], Jang Ha Ri and a few more characters. I personally didn't liked the FL. Even though she was a good actor.
At the end I would like to say is that it is quite a nice watch for the Zombie lovers out there. I am giving it an 9 rather than a 10 is because I think something that makes the drama wow is missing from this drama and I personally didn't liked the end that much. Hopefully we get answers about it in the future.

Frustrating Female Lead and Unlimited Plot holes
All of us are dead can be said as a high budget series with beautiful shots and gory details and props, but for me that was the only good thing about the series. Well, I can also add that most of the actors are really good too especially the veterans than we mostly recognized immediately in episode 1. It is enjoyable to watch in the sense that we can see that the production team did spend a lot of money for this series, the camera angles, the blood and the realistic entrails was fascinating to watch but that was all for me. The actors acting was wasted by the story line, all of the lead actors did tried their best to deliver their characters well and this is the problem, the female lead become frustratingly useless and stupid and all throughout the series I was exclaiming to my sister that she needs to get her priorities straight. I mean how stupid can you get if she keeps on whining about her crush instead of prioritizing her own life to survive and then telling your oldest friend that everyone that you hold dear in your life is either a zombie or missing ( girl best friend and crush) so she didn’t want to live anymore. She needed to be reminded about her father who might be worried and doing all that he can do to save her before she realize that she still has someone waiting for her to live. Aside from that she was useless and weak compare to her other classmates and there are so many side story that in the end wasn’t particularly necessary to have.

There is also a lot of plot holes that was so funny to watch that my sister and I keep asking each other if we have miss something because that wasn’t possible to happen. One of those is that magic towel that seems to materialized in the roof top, where could have they gotten that one when they have nothing on them when they were running towards the roof top and the inconsistencies of the “Hambies” power. The difference between Gwi nam, Eun Ji and Nam ra’s abilities were so unfair and I know they are zombies but Gwi nam keeps on reviving everytime when everyone else just die after a major blow to their bodies. There is also the fact that it wasn’t establish what sets them apart from the other zombies, I refused to believe that the will of the father and mother of the male lead and female lead isn’t as strong as the will of Gwi nam to get revenge on Cheong san. Overall, if you just want a good ol’ gory horror film with a lot of meaningless deaths and stupid decision this can be a good series to watch if you have nothing to watch.

All Of Us Are Dead; A Brainless Gore Fest, Or A Brutal Survival Story?

The increasing popularity of the zombie genre in South-Korean media since the days of Park Joo Seok’s ‘ Train To Busan’ (2016) has exceeded no bounds. Indeed, Netflix’s latest venture into the world of zombies, ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’, enjoyed making several ironic and passing popular-culture references to the heavily influential zombie flick . Nevertheless director Lee Jae Gyo and screenwriter Chun Sung II’s zombie survival series , ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ , delivered a grisly and somewhat niche insight into the world of zombies, teen-angst and everything in-between…

Based upon Joo Dong Geun’s popular and original webcomic ‘ Now At Our School’, the twelve-episode Netflix series begins on a rainy rooftop in the fictional South-Korean province named Hyosan. A group of high school bullies ( “ iljins”) are shown to be relentlessly tormenting their fellow classmate, Jin-Su. Yet as their punches and beatings become notably more savage and violent , Jin-Su’s reactions to the conflict gradually change also. The gentle pleas of the meek teen suddenly turn into savage and animalistic snarls as Jin-Su’s gentle attitude soon begins to mimic an untamed and feral beast.

After the aftermath of the violent fight scene, viewers are left shocked but aware of the gradual domino effect as revelations and further mysteries are soon brought to light.

A time-skip forwards to the beginning of a new school day at Hyosan High School, brings forward the viewers’ attention towards Kim Hyeon-ju (Jung Yi-seo), an inquisitive high-school student , who unknowingly becomes patient zero to the mysterious zombie virus. Unsurprisingly, it is only a matter of time before there is a sudden snowball effect of rising infections throughout the school.

Caught up in the maelstrom of pandemonium and hysteria, the remaining survivors, including Chung-san (Yoon Chan-young), On-jo (Park Ji-hoo), Nam-ra (Cho Yi-hyun), Lee Soo-hyuk (Park Solomon), Yoo Gwi-nam (Yoo In-soo) and Lee Na-yeon (Lee Yoo-mi) , are left to grapple with unimaginable horrors, sacrifices and truths along the way…

‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ isn’t a series for the lighthearted. Bloodthirsty and brutal from beginning to end, Chung Sung II’s screenplay was gratuitously gory, disturbing and not afraid to delve into some darker subject areas either. However, whilst gore and bloodshed is to be expected in a storyline revolving around the flesh-eating undead, ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ often felt somewhat distracted by its own investment into grotesque and shock-value carnage also. As a consequence, this notably presented limited opportunities into enforcing pathos and sentimental value for viewers towards its wide ensemble of main characters.

The acting range of ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ was a slight mixed-bag. The main cast, specifically Cho Yi-hyeon, Lee Yoo-Mi and Yoon Chan Young, were undeniably dynamic and brilliant onscreen. On the other hand, certain performances from particular costars could feel somewhat inconsistent due to a mixed range of line deliverances and acting abilities also.

Nevertheless despite some arguably questionable moments of implicit violence, ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ did surprisingly offer some crisper moments of respite also. Heartfelt interactions and teen-angst allowed golden-opportunities to exploit the unspoken realities of teenage shenanigans- bullying, social hierarchies, blackmail, peer pressure and sexual assault were notably addressed and touched upon within the drama’s social commentary. However despite certain commendation being deserved towards Chun Sung II and director Lee Jae Gyo‘s tackled subject areas , the attempt to tackle copious amounts of different topics take on against a dystopian zombie apocalypse backdrop, often led to a somewhat ham-fisted approach towards potentially impactful and prominent messages and critiques. In particular by the finale of the series, the overindulgence of subject areas began to slowly slip through the cracks and gave way to the sheer pandemonium of gritty teen-angst.

As for the delivered pace of narrative, Chung Sung II’s screenplay was notably fast-paced and adrenal-infused during initial episodes. However after the fanatic chaos of initial episodes, screenwriter Chung Sung II began to notably downplay chase scenes and conflict in order to draw further attention towards the setups, dilemmas and scenarios of the plot instead. However, this screenwriting decision did present a double-edged sword for the narrative; insightful moments focusing on the storyline did allow opportunities to explore the scope of characters and subplots, whilst also being heavily burdened by a repetitive pattern of storyline events in later episodes.

In particular this became noticeable the following setup; the ragtag team of teens would become wary of one another and drift apart, an external conflict would force them to band together again as a team, a member of the team would decide to embrace their inner-messiah and self-sacrifice themselves, before a teary and angst-ridden resolution would turn the mood somber as the characters remembered their fallen classmate, and then repeat.

Nevertheless, director Jae Gyu’s eye for detail was admittedly fairly commendable within the chosen filming techniques under his directing reign. Whilst the single-camera setup was admittedly a minimalistic approach to filming, Jae Gyu’s usage of changing gradients, darkening tones, angles and key and unobtrusive focus upon the characters and scenarios will truly immerse viewers into the events of the series. The usage of an OST was notably comprised mainly of instrumentals- hoping to draw attention in particular to a synchronic usage of music and imagery, rather than lyrics alone.

‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ offered viewers with a bloodthirsty and angst-ridden zombie drama which whilst certainly delivering an impactful bite into social themes, brutality, imagery and tension, the series often felt as though it but off more than it could chew at times within a lacking scope of character development, writing opportunities and divergence. The ending of the series was notably an unexpected twist which highly delved into a notably more somber tone. Whilst the finale may differ for viewers dependent on expectations, the conclusion certainly did leave some intriguing food for thought also. Overall ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ is a pacy binge-watch; notably without its questionable flaws, repetitiveness and tropes, but tense enough to keep viewers hooked upon shock-value and adrenaline also.

How far will you go in order to survive?
""All of us are dead"" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.

As the drama consists a very high number of brutal and gore scenes, in addition with bulling and sexual harassment, it's not for the lighthearted. The drama's extreme violence made the drama at times really disturb and difficult to watch. If you know you can't bear it, then avoid it.

As for the drama's pace, the first episode is slow but the drama in general is very fast paced because it contains many action scenes. As the drama is very suspenseful and stressful to offset seriousness, and make the drama easier to watch, at times it has some comic reliefs. Thus, every episode is good watching experience. As it's a 12-episode drama though, it's difficult to binge-watch it right away.


The Story

""All of us are dead"" is based on a webtoon by the same name, written by Joo Dong-Geun. The original run of the webtoon was from May, 13th 2009 to November, 9th 2011. The story mainly revolves around the struggle for survival of the students who were trapped in the ground zero for the zombie virus, the school.

Webtoon comparison

The drama adaptation has many differences with the original story that gave it some advantages and disadvantages. I will analyze some of these changes below.

1. The beginning
Unlike the original story, which starts straight away, the drama invests some time to set the characters background. The advantage of this change was that the viewers had the time to get to know the characters so it was easier later to understand their motives and empathize with them. The disadvantage of this change was that the first episode was slow and it may be boring for some of the viewers.

2. The center of the story
In both stories the center of the drama was the school, but in the drama, we see a lot of subplots outside the school that originally didn't exist, or they weren't fully developed. That way, we see a more global picture of the events that took place under the zombie apocalypse. For example, the overall government's response was more carefully written and seemed more logical and comprehensive in drama.

The disadvantage of this change was that some of the extra subplots were completely unnecessary (and illogical) and that could easily put off some viewers (which in my case happened).

3. Characters & relations
As the drama consists of many extra scenes and subplots, some of the characters are extra too. Apart from this, some of the original characters have different storylines, deaths and relationships from the original story. As for the storyline, the actions of a lot of characters changed but their personalities remained the same. As far as the dead are concerned, the only thing that changed was the cause or the timing of their death. This change was neutral for me as the results were the same as the webtoon.

4. Action
The drama is filled with a huge amount of action scenes and almost all of them aren't part of the original story. On the one hand, the action made the drama a thrilling watching experience as some of them were pretty amazing. On the other hand, as far as the story's events are concerned, due to the action ""overdose"" the story got draggy. This affected the characters also because, even though they had better and more complete background and relations than the webtoon, the necessary time for them to develop through the episodes, wasn't given.

5. The virus' origin
The virus origin that causes the zombie apocalypse is different in the drama. I can't analyze this in detail because I don't want to spoil it. What can I say is that in the drama they tried to make a full background of the virus and support it with sci-fi biology elements which was pretty convincing for someone who doesn't know about biology. Again, this was an advantage for the drama.

6. The ending
Both endings have many similarities but the webtoon ends while the drama may require a second season. As the webtoon has ended, the second season of the drama will be completely unrelated with the original story. The writers don't have elements to base a second season on, so it's unsure if a second season will be released or if it will end up being a good sequence of the story. This change may be a big disadvantage for someone who doesn't like incomplete stories but at least the story has a closure so maybe it's less frustrating.

Conclusion
The drama and the webtoon have countless differences which have both negative and positive effects on the story. We can say that the drama's story is loose based on the webtoon as it just kept the story skeleton and created a new one. In general, I think the adaptation can be considered as a good one.

My overall impression of the drama’s story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.

The production & Acting

The greatest thing about this drama, it's its production and directing, they were just amazing. Maybe ""All of us are dead"" has one of the best productions a Netflix original kdrama has. From the VFX to the zombie’s make-up, to the choreographed action scenes, to the scene’s shots and transitions, everything was perfectly and meticulously made. The music on the other hand was the weakest part of the production as it wasn't so memorable to me and it felt a little off from time to time.

The acting in general was okay. As I've said before, the drama mainly had action scenes so the actors didn't have enough to work with and create multi-dimensional characters with complex emotions. Some actors, though, manage to shine and catch my attention as a viewer. These were Yoo Chan Young, Jo Yi Hyun and Park Solomon.

Overall

""All of us are dead"" was a drama with a mediocre typical story about zombies. It doesn't have the touching story of ""Train to Busan”, the mysterious aura of ""Kingdom"", the uniqueness of ""Sweet Home"" or ""Happiness"" but it has one of the best productions of zombie action scenes which makes it a very decent and solid zombie drama. So, if you're looking for a drama for zombies with impressive action elements, watch it for sure. You won't be disappointed.

Namhyeok supremacy
I have to start this off with my favorite part of — Suhyeok and Namra, who totally stole the show, both individually and together. I just loved Namra's character arc in particular, and though romance is by no means a main focus of this show, their scenes are the ones I keep going back to rewatch.

With that being said, I think it was really good that romance wasn't a main focus, and yet it was there in certain light-hearted moments, reminding us that these characters are still kids who deal with crushes and first kisses and butterflies. I think both of the main relationships were done absolutely beautiful and we got just the right amount for them.

I think my main criticism with this is just the massive amount of unnecessary characters there are. I liked the two main groups for sure (although I admit some of those characters felt extra — it was as if they were to die in case someone needed to be killed off) and some of the peripheral characters like parents, and I anxiously awaited moments where their paths would cross. But other than that, there were a lot of other character groups and arcs that took up time and got incomplete arcs like the politician, the livestreamer, or the pregnant girl; I either didn't care for those or were downright annoyed with them. Even some of the characters that were more relevant kind of had their character development swerving off-kilter in a non-sensical way.

I also felt like the last episode was really rushed; I felt like taking out some of those unnecessary characters and spending more time with the main group could have given the changes in the last episode more screentime — I also wouldn't have been opposed to having this be a full 16-episodes so we could see more about the aftermath and maybe get an ending that was more satisfying. It currently stands a bit bittersweet and I have mixed feelings on that.

In conclusion - watch for Suhyeok and Namra.

Highschool of the Dead ?
Are you dead in this zombie year? ?
IF Not, I think every zombie lover and no lover should watch this mainly because of its top-notch VFX.
Though I find some of the acts are little sloppy but the overall story is well executed. I waited really long for the first season but it didn't disappoint me. I wish there is a second season.
But why are zombies are so sensitive to sound in every movie or series?
Some people just don't listen to what others had to say on the other hand some don't speak up for themselves.
I think Covic turn us into some kind of zombie that's why I like this series very much.

Entertaining enough, but no real likeable characters
Likes: As a fan of the zombie genre, I thought the production was pretty good. The action scenes were tense and nicely done. It was entertaining enough that I don't regret watching this.

Dislikes:
- There were no real likeable characters. No one stood out. And because the characters weren't fleshed out enough, I didn't feel a connection with any of them so I wasn't really rooting for anyone that strongly. Nobody really left an impression.
- I especially didn't like the character of Ohn Jo. She was so dull (as with most of the female characters for most of the drama) Having one of the main characters be so dull was a wrong move.
-Lack of clear leads. I wasn't sure half the time who were supposed to be the main leads. Is it Cheong San/Ohn Jo? Or is it Nam ra/Soo Hyuk? I think if the drama had focused on the Nam ra/ Soo Hyuk arc , fleshed that out a bit more and also the hybrid changes that Nam ra was going through, the drama would have been more interesting.
-Lack of depth in the story arcs. Like what was the purpose of the detective, his partner, the baby, and little girl? They added no value to the story. And the whole arc of Ohn Jo and her father was kind of a let down. And the purpose of introducing the arrow shooting nuna so late in the game?
-Draggy moments. Not gonna lie. I did FF a little in the draggy parts.

Overall disappointing? Yes, but I was still entertained enough mainly due to my love for the zombie chase. Would I watch this again? No. Would I watch another season? Yes, esp if they concentrated on the zombie hybrids and have cool action scenes.

All Of Us Are Dead review
First, the whole production is on another level as expected of netflix korea! the whole cast really did well, there were some parts that are kinda lacking but overall I really like Cheongsan and Suhyeok’s chemistry especially when they’re fighting the zombies! Also I like Namra’s character, she’s so badass and cool. The bullying issues and the way the school tried to cover it up resulting to the science’s teacher’s experiment to make his son stronger so he can fight those who bullied him. The sacrifices each character made was so tear jerking :( they’re parents and friends turning into zombie was so sad. Tbh I was so mad at Gwinam why can’t he just die, he had to bite Cheongsan and poke his eye (this part was so heartbreaking) then one by one they’re getting bitten, maybe that’s reason for the title :( but the ending got me so hanging like yeah kdrama usually end it like that but hopefully there’ll be season 2 cause I don’t want Cheongsan to die like that :’(

A treat for Zombie Thriller lovers ....
(Non Spoiler Review)

No matter what, always stick to the orginal content, there is no compromise in the story and its very brutal, Netflix Orginal drama doesn't disappoint us these days. Every month they brought something really worth for time. All of us are dead probably one of the best zombie thriller i have had watched in recent time. The concept of zombie is now become a cliché, even though this whole drama was a different experience.

This is a webtoon adaptation with same name, the episodes numbers were increased which was unusual for a Netflix Orginal drama also some episode length were little bit high. Some people may feel little dragging in the middle and its understandable because they slowly making this whole atmosphere more and more intense. The making was one of the key factor. Its just unbelievable every time when you watching a zombie thriller. The performance of all those zombie looks scary, here also it's insane.

I didn't felt much of a dragging in the screenplay as i already mentioned they slowly developing the seriousness of the situation. May be we can predict almost every scene that coming next but still some breathtaking moments were there, which gives you a different experience for sure. The performance of the leads was good especially some stories like this, there is always have one or two annoying character who gets all attention, that feels super cliché. But eventually you get annoyed and that's what the makers want.

The emotional scenes, Friendship, little bit of romance also little bit of love triangle, everything was good and perfect fit. Overall all of us are dead is a must watch drama if you are a zombie thriller fan. Every episode is thrilling and engaging till the end. Try it

ZOMBIE thriller and forget the rest
Trust me on this one. The Netflix drama is thrill watching. Forget about the cast and jump into it. From the beginning to the end the drama holds you to your couch. The production is just too good. With nice VFX and zombie action to sound effects just take this one to another level. I don't know much about other Zombie K dramas but this has become my new favorite. Train to Busan was my last zombie movie.

DON'T compare this drama to any other piece of work. Just go with the flow, the story takes place in a high school and the rest you will get to it. The supporting characters maintain their pace and run the plot smoothly. Believe me, the zombie attacks were well executed and opened a new window for more such scenes. Whatever be your expectations please watch it one go. It will give you excitement for more without thinking much.

The plot was concise and completed in season 1 itself. As a typical Netflix show, there is a slim chance for season 2.
For the zombie drama lovers, I know you will not be disappointed and will quench your thirst from this.

Excited to start your week with a fun and thrilling high school zombie flick? Then this isn't it.
I was very excited about this one. In the pictures, it looked so good. The trailer was well-made and was hype material. And it's gotten quite popular as well. I couldn't wait to binge this since I have seen Kingdom, Train to Busan, Sweet Home (Not exactly zombies but monsters/survival type) and thought maybe they're good with these themes. But I was mistaken.

The problem with All of Us Are Dead is how stereotypical it is. The main character is the childhood friend of the female main character and they also have two other friends with them. There is the ""Hot Oppa"" type of character who is very righteous and very strong. There is the quiet class president who's the topper of the class and is very smart but no one likes her because they all assume that she doesn't like them as well. There is also this annoying girl who's literally annoying for no reason at all. I can go on and on. These characters feel like I've seen them before in so many different media. And a major problem is how they act so stiff. It doesn't feel like they are real characters making real decisions. It's almost like the series itself wants these characters to stay between a set of tropes and never do something different.

There is this one character (who I will not specify for spoiler reasons) who stays true to their stereotype in almost all of the episodes. And almost an entire episode was dedicated to their character, we get to see how they are finally starting to change as a character, and right after that moment, the character dies. My question is, why? What was the point of wasting that much time over that character if they were gonna die with zero development? Unfortunately, this series pulls this so many times that it majorly affected my viewing experience.

If that wasn't enough, the plot is just so predictable. When you can literally tell what event is gonna take place in the next few minutes, the series is not doing a good job in the storytelling department. There were some moments I could automatically tell who's gonna die next. And no, this isn't something that's common for horror-thriller or zombie-survival types of movies, because to my memory, good series like Kingdom or movies like Train to Busan was never like that. You couldn't automatically tell what's gonna happen next because the story is being told in a perfect way and the events felt sudden like it was supposed to.

Characters often make decisions that are so stupid that I actually don't know if they are even a human. For example, one of the characters died while trying to push a zombie away with their fist. You are in a zombie apocalypse and instead of protecting the place where you could be bitten easily, you choose to push a zombie away with your hand right next to their mouth when you literally have other objects you can use to push them away. That isn't the only instance of dumb decisions. The choices these characters make in the entirety of this series are so bad. Sometimes, I couldn't help but wish all of them had just gotten bitten already.
I was more entertained watching the detective's perspective and that one Seoul University guy (Not Sang-Woo) and that one stupid vlogged. Then it would turn into a zombie comedy but at least it would be entertaining compared to whatever this is.

The series spends more time explaining how to make an emergency toilet than explaining how the zombie mechanics work and why some people turn into half-zombies and some people don't.

They also had to include so many characters, some of them end up having zero developments and are left uninteresting. Later on, the series just kills them off in true Korean drama fashion.

Sound and production are not impressive enough to write home about. The cast is overwhelmingly big and some characters are terribly written. The main female character, On-Jo's acting was so stiff sometimes. She has only one expression throughout the entire series.

If you think you should still watch this and see for yourself, go ahead. Just a warning, it's 12 episodes long and each episode's duration is almost an hour. So when you round it up, it's a 12 hour-long series.

If you think that this series isn't worth your time, and if you are okay with some spoilers explaining how ridiculous some moments were in the whole series that just ruin your experience, refer to this comment of mine:
https://mydramalist.com/59449-our-school-now#comment-8593081

Well, that's the gist of it. You are still free to be adventurous and watch this series, as we all perceive media in a different way depending on the person, you might enjoy it. But I won't recommend this to anyone. Not only is it very long, it just wastes time with useless moments that don't contribute to the story later on.

This ain't no Train to Busan!! Skip it!
I am a huge zombie movie/ drama fan and this show was a waste of 12 hours of my life. Poorly written, poorly acted- the only reason anyone is watching it is because it is a Netflix production,
Unnecessarily includes sexual assault (which isn't in the original story) and nudity of a minor. If this was necessary to the arc of the story I would understand ... but it isn't so it seems to have been shoved into the story for shock value and probably some misogyny on the part of the director. Then the end game for this bullied student is SUCH A WASTE.
Same goes for teenage pregnancy and a girl with no sign of being pregnant seemingly and with no issues gives birth to her baby in the toilet and after this is good to go and run around town ... how is this relevant to the story? Who knows?
Poor character development and no one makes you want to root for them- in the end you hope all of them will be dead ...
Such wasted potential for a zombie drama set in a high school ...

An unconventional zombie series : apocalyptic devastation with high-school shenanigans
What would happen if your school was attacked by zombies? Netflix’s latest hit K-drama, All of Us Are Dead, attempts to give us a solid answer to this question, as Hyosan High School turns into a fast-sinking ship when a science experiment gone terribly wrong results in a virus-induced zombie outbreak.

For a few years now, South Korean entertainment has been pushing the narrative boundaries of the zombie genre. They have deftly used it as a vehicle to explore not just present-day political and social issues (#Alive, 2020), but have also inserted the undead in their period dramas (Kingdom, 2019).

However, what makes All of Us Are Dead stand out amidst this growing list of K-Zombie content are the central protagonists in the series. The motley crew of survivors are not your gun-slinging, machete-wielding, adept zombie-killing protagonists, these are teenagers who quite literally have to grab the object nearest to them and hastily fashion a weapon out of it.

This is also where the show finds its sparingly lighter moments. Friends dole out advice on dealing with high school crushes as bloody zombies snarl in the background (!) But beyond these interactions, the series takes a massive departure from the traditional route of keeping a zombie apocalypse setting somewhat comically chaotic. Instead, directors Lee JQ and Kim Nam-su choose not to shy away from tackling the emotional weight of death and mayhem.

The best example of this is seen when the show deals with the zombification or “turning” of humans. A shot usually reserved to fulfil the horror quota is turned on its head to play out poignantly heartbreaking scenes. In place of a hastened transformation, we get a drawn-out process, in which the horror stems from the now-undead zombie reconciling with the loss of their humanity, often right in front of their classmates.

The directors do not whiplash the audience back into zombie-infested reality; instead we sit with the students in numbing grief as they lose their friends, classmates and teachers, over and over again. The heavy storyline doesn’t feel misplaced, as writer Chun Sung-il richly fleshes out these teen characters to carry forward the complex tale.

Nam On-jo (Park Ji-hu) serves as a narrative protagonist who bands together with her childhood friend Lee Cheong-san (Yoon Chan-young), her crush Lee Su-hyeok (Park Solomon), and the aloof overachieving class President Choi Nam-ra (Cho Yi-hyun) among other classmates to fight zombies and school bullies alike.

Director Lee JQ’s choice to cast actors “unfamiliar to the audience” pays off masterfully.

The makers also ensure that the layered storytelling does not come at the cost of high-adrenaline action scenes, jump scares and well-executed VFX gore. Mirroring the title sequence, the directors slowly descend the audience into a zombie-filled reality, and the series conveys the same visually. What starts off as a brightly-lit, vividly colourful school, eventually transforms into a nauseatingly dull place with the colour saturation dialed back, as the virus spreads.

When required, the filmmakers also immerse us into the zombie experience. The cinematography during the zombie-human confrontation scenes moves fast, never quite fixating on a single character, which makes for quite unsettling viewing. It is havoc heightened for the students, as well as the audience watching, as we learn along with them, who survived and who didn’t.

Another unconventional directorial choice comes in the form of how the show is paced out. With 12 episodes, each almost an hour long, the story stretches out the events of each day over multiple episodes. The material to fill this time comes from the pockets of survivors it creates throughout the city.

Though the storyline follows a core group of students trapped in high school, we are also given glimpses of a politician scrambling to escape her office; a social media influencer trying to farm the crisis for viral content; and two police officers, mismatched in their levels of courage, racing to retrieve the antidote.

These different dynamics are crafted for the series to also address multiple systemic issues. With the origin of the zombie virus itself rooted in a history of bullying, the school becomes ground zero for the show to explore social class hierarchies.

Additionally, for the senior students of Hyosan High, the zombie apocalypse does not even figure as a priority stressor. With the university entrance exams looming over, Park Mi-jin, a student, laments, “It’s impossible for me to get into college even if I live,” while practicing her zombie killing techniques.

The dynamic between how the State handles this crisis and its effect on students also serves as a microcosm for how authorities react to apocalyptic situations. Unfortunately, this is also where the plot wavers a bit. The series often attempts to pack in too much, as it stretches two separate storylines involving teenage pregnancy and sexual assault across multiple episodes. Not enough time is spent on either narrative to create meaningful conclusions or provide these characters with a kinder, more humane ending.

Ultimately, in a genre teeming with Hollywood’s undying need to provide the perfect post-apocalyptic male-hero zombie killer tale, South Korea has bravely put forth a story of survival. Oscillating between the alive and the undead, the show makes an impact by centering the fact that endurance doesn’t always mean strength, sometimes it is born out of repeated acts of kindness.

Not good enough
I understand they are young actors, lets put that acting aside. I have only one complaint, all the characteristics are annoying, stupid, dumb and impulsive. The story itself feels like what if i am tenager in the zombie apocalypse by a adult. They had so many chances to escape and save if only they properly coordinated with each other, but what did they do, all they did was complain, discuss love, and bunch of crazy stupid things.

I can only say it's an okay watch. Some people saying there will be a season 2, please don't if you don't have tight storyline.

A succession of gore and betrayal
I’ll start by saying that the production is very good, but it’s not a surprise as there is nothing less to expect from Netflix. All the actors did a great job.
They tried hard to come up with a fresh story about zombies. In brief, the drama Is the typical survival race against zombies with a mix of gore & korean school issues such as bullying, teen sex, etc.

From the origin to the virus to the end with Nam-ra & “others like her”, it is poorly explained and doesn’t really make sense.
The drama could have been good, but unfortunately, It is overall a disappointment. The characters aren’t developed and it became a succession of unfortunate events, of useless fights between the characters, of human beings at their lowest points, etc. It feels they tried so hard to go against cliches that they just made the worst happened to “surprise” you.
Some characters & scenes are useless to the story & it feels that some scenes were added to add length to the story but definitely failed to add depth. The teenager who had a baby. On-Jo’s father who spent 10 episodes to look for, but died after 1,5 min he reunited with her, The bully that stays alive (but we don’t know how) & spent all episodes to run after ML to finally gauge his eye out and died with him. Etc, etc...

It reminded me a lot #Alive but with schoolmates rather than neighbours. The drama format was issueless and they could have made a movie out of this story, it would have probably avoided all the unnecessary added scenes.

Watch if you can stand loopholes, idiocracy and unserved justice
Acting is great not gonna lie.
The main issue i have with this drama was how they presented multiple themes/backstories but left them all hanging/unsatisfiable.
Seriously, the bullies’ outcome aint equivalent to what they delivered to their victims.
Also, there were quite a few unnecessary sacrifices, omg, all the character development for them to be written off so badly..
If you can stand illogic, stupid and selfish decisions made by the survivors, do go ahead!
Brace yourself to take everything lightly if not this show will seriously give you anxiety and hair-pulling moments.
(Think i've gotten myself high blood pressure from screaming at the screen whenever the survivors do something WITHOUT common sense.)

Nevertheless, its pretty fast paced and addicting.
Also, KUDOS TO THE ZOMBIE CGI!!!
The choreography of the infected turning into zombies is so beautiful and creative!

Fun watch that’s Bloody and Action Packed throughout, even if the concept is not groundbreaking
I really enjoyed the show. I’m usually very critical with shows like this because this is really one of my favourite genres and even the western shows that I watch usually fall in this space. All 12 episodes were action packed and fun with good characters and that’s what matters to me. It’s not a totally new storyline or concept for sure, may NOT be everyone’s type if they’re not looking for some bloody, gory and great action scenes but I’m very satisfied with what we got.

Performances were weak by good amount of the cast, but the characters were likeable and took realistic decisions at times. Not every ‘evil’ character is given an unnecessary redeemable story as well, which I do like while some who faced tough situations broke down understandably. Through some of the characters could have been provided a better background. There was overall a good depiction of humanity as well.

You do have to drop logic when you watch shows like this but if you don’t have to face unnecessary romantic moments (they were definitely there but again, these are High School students so some of the behavior makes sense *shrugs*) or don’t continue watching just because there are some pretty people you want to look at throughout. Not to mention they didn't overuse a concept you'll get to see at the middle of the series which other dramas definitely would.

The drama also takes bold decisions to keep us engaged, though, some deaths felt unworthy. There is no unnecessary music or soundtrack throughout, the background music is fun and doesn’t overlap any of the scenes either, which I really liked. The scale of the show was clearly big, considering they made good use of the sets and the streets and it didn’t feel monotonous or boring in terms of the setting. They brought back so many actors to perform as zombies even in the last few episodes, meaning the whole team was really dedicated to it, not something we’ll see usually.

Overall, solid 9/10. If you wonder why the overall rating is good while I haven’t rated other aspect on MDL that well, it’s because the CGI, Sets, Action/Choreography were very good especially when you consider it’s a K-drama, so the overall rating does shoot up.

This is how you write and direct a zombie TV series
This is way far better than all The Walking Dead seasons combined. Highly recommended for both who likes the zombie genre and those who doesn't like it.

This isn't your usual, ordinary, zombie show. It's full of character development, real life and realistic drama, and lessons in survival and life itself.

In this show, they truly captured how high school students would have acted and think. While maybe, some characters and situations were annoying, you would realize that's how you and your classmates would have been at that age of your life. They also did not shy away from showing the very difficult task of making decisions, and best of all, how in the middle of fear, uncertainty, and death, humanity still can trust and support each other at the end of the day.

It's not all running. There are stories behind every episode, every character, every scene. Something you don't see in majority of zombie films and TV series.

Reskinned Sweet Home?
I'll keep this review short.
If apocalyptic movies and dramas are of your taste, you've probably watched many of the popular ones out there, including Sweet Home (which is also getting a S2 very soon). While watching All of Us are Dead, many of the scenes had me thinking back at Sweet Home's plot. The plot is so overused and repetitive ;-; I would just recommend that you go watch Sweet Home if you haven't yet/if you're looking for a good apocalypse drama, cus this isn't it. The casts carried this drama imo, esp the male lead.

TLDR
If you're looking for a good drama, go watch Sweet Home instead. They invested way more into that drama and the CGI is insane. Not up to par to this drama.

I have one request
I won't talk much. I want a second season. We want a second season. Chaebaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal <3
School-based zombie story is amazing but the future of those students is not clear. So a second season is mandatory.
The ending was amazing and exciting at the same time, you can't leave us hanging like this.
There are many after stories that can feed a great epic second season and I will be the first to watch it. I finished the whole drama in one day and a few hours and I still wanna watch it again but I want a second season, please.

All of Us Are Spread (too thin)
It's hard to review a drama that I generally really like but cannot help get hung up on its numerous flaws. In order to explain this conundrum, I will go into HEAVY SPOILERS. Avert your eyes unless you watched all 12 episodes or, like myself, are spoiler junkies.

SPOILERS in T minus 5...4...3...2...1...LETS GO!

Half plot armor, half cop out...but worse than either

Like any genre, zombie genre has cliches and that's perfectly fine. They exist in storytelling to move the story forward cause stories aren't real life. So once in a while, a character will have to do something stupid to change the status quo. Also, all stories that put characters in peril will bestow plot armor on those whom the story needs to hang on a bit longer. These characters will survive the unsurviveable situations, while the ones without the plot armor won't, even though everyone should have been dead by that point. This is fine too unless it's used to an excess, which this drama does.

That leads me to the concept of ""halfbie"". This is a portmanteau for half zombie but it really means half plot armor half copout. It basically breaks the universe - a bitten character doesn't become a mindless zombie but keeps human appearance and intelligence, gets super powers (abnormal strength, enhanced hearing and smell, fast healing, basically hard to kill) and, if Mary Sue or Gary Stu, is able to reign in hunger for human flesh. You can see from the very description why this sucks and doesn't fit in the universe where there are living and the walking dead. It's a cliche created to spare writer's pet (in this case Nam Ra) and make existing villain more intimidating (in this case Gwi Nam). However, the effect is opposite. Gwi Nam, aka the Evil Plot Armorie/Cop Outie, became an unintentional comic relief. You could get really sloshed if played a drinking game every time he survived a fall from the rooftop, snapped his bones back and muttered ""f***er"". Nam ra, aka the good Plot Armorie/Cop Outie, mostly stood on the sidelines gazing into nothing unless her love interest was attacked by the Mullet'd Cockroach of a villain (since he kept coming back like a roach) and occasionally would hear zombie footsteps about 30 seconds before the herd swarmed the safe place. But in numerous instances when the gang hit the hard-to-break locked door (another drinking game that would get you hammered in no time!) , she would forget she was abnormally strong. And given that zombies cannot distinguish between themselves and halfbies, she could have safely run errands, which would have saved lives, but never did. Basically, the whole point of her ""evolved"" status was for romantic purposes. Her love interest defied his friends because he trusted she wouldn't harm anyone, while she repeatedly saved him from Mullet'd Cockroach. That's really all there is to this plot device. Romance enhancer. No real consequence for the plot. Just something for shippers to drool over. Ooooh, he tied them together with the red string of fate! Oooooh, she was about to bite him but he said ""do it cause then I will be like you!"" and she kissed him instead! SWOON! :insertvomitemoji:

Spread the butter so thin til there's no butter

Another problem with this drama is really a typical K drama problem - too much filler, too many sideplots and characters that don't add up to the whole. Two cops and the baby and a little girl added up to nothing. It was a bathroom break. Ditto Youtuber subplot. Ditto Assembly Member subplot. Even On Jo's father's quest to reach his daughter could have been scrapped. 12 episodes spread the story too thin. It worked when it was focused on the highschool survival. It came to a screeching halt when it was about outside world and characters. It could have made the point across in half the running time.

Bromance and womance >>>>>> romance

As is always the case in dramas, romance is the inferior relationship. This drama has a love quadrangle in its center that is just there but doesn't actually impact the plot. Cheong San is motivated to protect On Jo, who doesn't reciprocate his feelings, but he also protects all his friends so you could have the same story without unrequited love. In the end, he would have sacrificed himself for everyone because he's that kind of a character. Love interest or not.

On Jo is in love with Soo Hyuk (who is in love with Nam Ra and vice versa) and that's it. Again, it adds up to nothing. She is stoically tolerant of Soo Hyuk/Nam Ra romance right before her eyes, is supportive of both, so that she is in love with him is just a throwback reference. Kind of like, this character has no real personality we might as well give her an unrequited love to stand out.

Soo Hyuk and Nam Ra romance fares a little better cause they at least had the enemies to lovers thing going when she became a halfbie. But since they are side characters to leads Cheong San and On Jo, there was no real impact there. And, weirdly, the ending forgot about it, so when the gang reunited with Nam Ra, she and Soo Hyuk didn't have a moment together. Instead, she had a moment with On Jo. :facepalm:

But on the bright side, bromance (Woojin and his ""brother in law"", Cheong San and Soo Hyuk - get a room you two! , and any combo of boys) and womance (Mijin and Ha ri) were excellent. I also enjoyed Jae Ik and Seoul Student banter even though they were in a bathroom break filler.

A Star Is Born

Park Solomon aka Lomon aka Soo Hyuk lit up the screen every time he was in and it wasn't even close. He bursts with genuine charisma and charm on top of amazing visuals. And he has range. I found acting to be a mixed bag but he was consistently strong.

That Ep 3 twist - Aigoo!

Really have to commend the drama for how Geong Su got infected. My jaw dropped on the floor and I still didn't pick it up. Wow!

Some really well directed set pieces

The library fight and escape from zombies with falling book shelves was OTT but so memorable.

Hit me in the feels

Deaths packed the punch as did reunions between the living and the dead (Cheong San and his zombie mom, nuff said). As is always the case with survival dramas, the choice of who died is controversial. Did Woojin have to die? No. His death added nothing so he should have stayed alive. Did Cheong San have to die? If I had my way, I would give him the halfbie arc instead of Nam Ra. He was the lead and his unrequited love would count for something if On Jo realized she loved him but they couldn't be together because he was a halfbie. Oh well.

Namra Sue Spin-off or Will there be Season 2?

If you read I Am Legend and/or Girl With All the Gifts, than you know that halfbies (any human-zombie or human-vampire hybrid) cannot be trusted. In the end, they choose their kind over humans and go as far as to exterminate humans so that they wouldn't be hunted by them. Even if one of them likes a human or two. So whatever the gang saw when they look down to where Nam ra jumped, disturbed them. It cannot be good. Genre rules prevent coexistence.

That said, the ending felt too much like a set up for Namra Sue spin-off which I have no interest in. The appeal of the drama was in ordinary teens trying to survive extraordinary circumstances, not in zombie X Men fighting each other.

Overall

Plot armor cannot protect from simple pleasures of this drama. You'll be engaged, emotionally wrecked, you'll laugh and cry with characters and feel many deaths. Warts won't go away but they aren't all that is there.

Can justice be served in a unconventional way?
This is my first 10 since joining MDL december last year and that says a lot. I so loveee these types of series, gritty, dark, and suspenseful but school, youth, and coming of age. *chef's kiss*

This review took longer than usual because I wanted to savour every episode and try to understand every nuance without rushing. Don't get me wrong this show isn't perfect it has minor errors such as annoying characters and plot armor but not making a section for it because it's forgivable.

I've seen a lot of reviews here and other sites how the pacing is terrible, but I disagree. Even though promoted as a school drama, the minor things happening in Hyosan was necessary and compelling for the development and plot of the show.

These are the things I've liked about All of Us Are Dead

Social Issues
Even as a zombie series there are lot's of lessons we can think about as a society. Such as how bullying is a serious problem especially in korea or the school system and it's wrong priorities. Honestly many more as you decide to watch.

Plot/Story
The story was phenomenal for various reasons and can be interpreted depending on who's lens is watching. Personally, I was heavily in favor of the origin of the virus but not at the expense of other people's lives. As we progress, seeing the one's that are left behind I changed my mind. And honestly that's the beauty of it, but for spoiler reasons I'll just leave it at that.

Premise
AOUAD is trying to tell us that life is short and we shouldn't take it for granted. Furthermore we should tell the one's we love how much we love them because tomorrow or even later is such an uncertainty.

Actions
Props to every single cast performing the stunts of the series, especially the male leads. They performed it with such intensity that levels up the series.

Technical
The sound effects we're amazing. Saw Behind the scenes of how the zombie sounds were created, and I must say that I the dedication and effort was mindblowing. The set design such as the cinematography was amazing as well, it perfectly shows us the gore scenes which is good for viewing experience but bad for my stomach.

Screenplay
This is what kept me engaged outside the action and thrill, therefore props to the writer. The dialogues are so realistic like they are actually high school students because that's exactly how me and my friends act minus fighting zombies.

Acting/Characters
This also goes hand in hand with the screenplay, having good screenplay bad acting and vice versa really isn't ideal, but here we get both. The way the actors and actresses speak and their mannerism waaaaaas perfect like seriously perfect. I've seen Solomon in sweet revenge but thought his acting was lacking copared to Hyanggi but he redeemed himself here. Chan Young is someone I've never seen before but thought he was also amazing here, performed the actions scenes so well that even I am tired for him. My girl Jihoo deserves this break, saw her in the film house of hummingbird and in the drama beautiful world beforehand. She's the maknae of the cast but honestly the performed the best, Onjo had soo much emotional scenes and she perfectly nailed them all. Lastly the cuteeeest and my wife CHO YI HYUN. WOW she just made a 360 turn from her 2 recent drama's. From the cute and clumsy Jiwon to the mysterious and quiet class president Namra, versatility indeed. I loveeeeed the love and friendship of all characters in the show and how it doesn't solely focus on the apocalypse but also human connections and the one's left behind. The antagonists we're as good they successfully played their role and add thrill to the already thrilling series. Also successfully made my blood boil.

Parallels
This is a small detail but I had to include it. In our main group the male characters are always the one's protecting and leading the others. In comparison to our secondish group our two females are the one's leading, planning, etc. Smqll detail but sooo loved it because it removes the cliché that woman cannot survive an apocalypse.

****************************************************************************************************
Overall
To anyone that loves zombie and thriller movies, I surely do recommend these. For people saying that they are sick of zombies, I'd still give this a try. Because it gave new substances to the Zombie genre whilst remaining the gore we normally see in them. If you have any questions about it please do let me know and I'll try to answer as best as I can.

bittersweet ending
I had a lot of expectations and have been waiting for this drama since the teaser came out esp when I saw the cast because I was so excited that they finally have their main roles but when I watched it, I didn't absolutely love it still, I enjoyed it. there are a lot of familiar faces in the show and the cast did a really great job in portraying their roles.

but honestly wished that they cut this into like 10 episodes only, I feel like there are a lot of unnecessary scenes, and do I need to mention the frustrating and annoying characters.

I really don't get why they included Cheong san's mom scene of her going to school to save his son but when she got there she immediately became a zombie sklsjjd there are a lot of wasted characters!! ++ the half zombies esp. gwinam and eunji, I wanted to see eunji fighting w/ gwinam like she should've taken revenge on him. they built eunji's character like she's gonna take revenge but didn't instead they made her break phones and ride a bike. also, namra's character has big potential in the story but I feel like her character as a half-zombie hasn't been given much attention. I feel like out of all the three half-Zs, namra is the powerful one because of her knowing how to switch it on/off. but also wished that she fought with gwinam more or smth.

Overall, when it comes to zombies, S.Koreans really never fail. no need for S2 unless the next season would be focusing on the half zombies or smth but tbh Nah. One season is enough. anyways, love the bathroom team!!

if we are gonna be in a zombie apocalypse, the only zombies that I have a chance of surviving living with are the walking dead zombies. definitely not the WWZ, train to Busan, kingdom, and this. lol

Waste of time
In the beginning, I thought that the first episode was okay, but I was waiting for the characters to develop and the plot to become more interesting. However, it did not work for me that way.
The characters are bland, the acting is very stiff and did not make me feel any emotion other than annoyance. (especially Nayeon who was extremely irritating from the beginning) The main character even if she is showing some 'range' of emotions, I could not feel the emotions with her.
I did not find one character that could be likeable in this show, other than Chung San's mother. All of the characters in this series are extremely stupid... like: ""we have a good place to hide - let's go somewhere else now!"". The ones who survived managed to do this only by luck and (unnecessary) sacrifice of others.
This show was (in my opinion) exhausting to watch.

All Of Us Are Dead review
South Korea isn’t new to making zombie movies and shows. They have produced quality ones over the recent years so there’s a certain expectation from them in this subgenre.

I binge watched All of Us Are Dead upon its release. To put it simply, it’s about a group of students striving to survive in a zombie apocalypse. Sadly, half way through the series I already got bored. I wished they shorten it. There are so many scenes that don’t add much value. One thing to describe this show is ambitious. It wants to tackle several issues and cover everything resulting it to fall flat.

PRO:
I want to commend the camera work esp when all hell breaks loose. I like the continuous take in cafeteria scene. They showed the chaos from all sides, didn’t follow just handful of people. I also like the scene when the two policemen were running through town.

CONS:
I have no problem with characters even main leads dying. But meaningless deaths are irking. It came across as trying so hard to make an an impactful emotional scene. The build up is weak. It also has repetitive unnecessary sacrifices. It’s basically showing dumb ways to kill a character.

I’m bothered by some fight scenes because the locations of stunt wires are obvious. When they get kicked or do “some” stunt, it’s doesn’t look natural.

I’m not impressed at all acting wise but I had no problem with it. They’re just not ripe yet.

The ending felt abrupt and unsatisfying. Maybe it’s them calling for a second season. But to be honest, I prefer it to end properly in one season.

Overall the story is disappointing.

That being said, I think you’d still enjoy this if:
- you don’t mind a lot of plot holes
- you don’t watch much zombies films and dramas so you won’t have a point of comparison
- you are into high school sub genre

I really wanted this to be good
Coming off of shows like Sweet Home and Happiness that did survivalist horror so well, I had expectations for this. They weren't that high and I wasn't expecting another Sweet Home out of a traditional zombie apocalypse story, but I was anticipating a fun, off-the-walls zombie flick that would keep me entertained for a few hours. And it did! At first. Let me explain.

The drama starts off great with some well-shot, high-action scenes and a lot of unabashed gore and really gets you into it. You don't really know much about the characters other than a few facts thrown at you, but hey, it's zombies, most of them won't survive anyway. So I got really into it at first. The mystery surrounding the source of the virus wasn't all that interesting and immediately felt like a half-baked origin story, but it was good enough for the B-horror I was expecting.

Problems stemmed when time started to pass. The initial mayhem was brilliant but after a certain point, when the characters start talking about being hungry and thirsty, issues arose. The characters explicitly explain to one another what would happen if they didn't eat or find water soon. Then, well. They don't find any. What would normally be an important plot point in other zombie shows becomes a moot point here. They drink some rainwater at some point, each takes a bite out of a candy bar and that's about it. They talk about being hungry but show no signs of getting weaker or being malnourished, and their only goal throughout the series is to get rescued, never to find food or water.

The show has a LOT of B-plots and side characters that never have any satisfying conclusions. They introduce a bunch of characters that you think will be fleshed out or explained later but never are. And there are a LOT of plot holes. For instance:
1. The pregnant student is shown heavily in the first episodes. Her identity isn't explained and we know nothing about her aside from her giving birth and tying herself up with ribbon (just ribbon, yet somehow she doesn't break free) to keep from hurting her baby after she turns. That's it. She was there to add drama and tension but she wasn't added with a plot or reason. Shock value, at most.
2. On Jo's father is keyed up to be the man who will save the day. In early episodes, On Jo talks about how her father promised to be there for her if anything happened to her, that he would save her, and throughout most of the series, he does everything in his power to see that through. Most of the scenes we get of his character are him making his way to her school, so naturally, we expect the reunion to be a big, key point in the series, right? They've built it up that way. But no. He dies about 7 minutes after reuniting with her. In fact, their reunion is used as the big cliffhanger for one of the episodes, only for him to be turned into a zombie at the very beginning of the next. It was one of the biggest letdowns of the series and leaves a sour taste in your mouth when you realize that his entire purpose was just to build up tension. To add insult to injury, his 'noble sacrifice' was unnecessary. After he threw the first flare, the zombies ran to it and cleared a path for everyone to escape safely. Throwing more and not escaping was pointless.
3. The bullied girl had no character arc. She is one of the few intelligent zombies we get throughout the drama and so I expected something big to happen with her, but she just wandered around on her bike after trying and failing miserably to burn down the school. Then when I saw she reached the quarantined zone, especially after she bit her schoolmate, I expected all hell to break loose there. Nope. She was subdued. The whole point of her was to show the military that asymptomatic infections were a thing so that they would abandon the main cast at the school. Great storytelling.
4. Cheong San's mother. They had her do a little rescue mission only for her to fail at every obstacle. Her entire role was to leave a vehicle for the policemen to use (they could have just had one there from someone else, there was no reason to use a character for that) and to get to the school so that her son could be sad that she was a zombie. That's it.
5. Gwi Nam as the main antagonist of the series worked for a little while, but he got old pretty quickly as he never did much of anything. He'd show up, attack, they would 'kill' him and he'd come back after healing only to find they'd moved. Not that big of a threat, really.
6. The police officers, especially Song Jae Ik, were a great addition to the cast. I thought. Jae Ik was there from the start, saw Byeong Chan, and had the task of finding the laptop, so I naturally thought he'd be one of the few adults in this that would actually help the kids. Nope. Not what happened. He saves the baby and another random little girl, sure, but the moment the military saves them, he just dips out of the story. You see his face once or twice after that and that's it. He had fewer scenes and yet a better role in Happiness.
7. There was literally no point to the streamer. At all. Why was he in the story? He did absolutely nothing. Not one thing. And then he disappeared with the police officers.
8. The girl (I don't remember her name) who used her handkerchief to infect another student. She escaped, hid away in a storage room, was having a change of heart and was going to bring supplies to the others (and hey, that would have helped with that one plothole, wouldn't it?) and then she's killed off randomly. I didn't like her and don't care that she died, but if they were going to do that, they could have just had her die right away in the halls.
9. When Gwi Nam bit Nam Ra, she became an intelligent zombie. Everyone else he bit became regular zombies. How does that make sense? The strain that's passed on should be the one that he has, so logically, everyone he bites should become an intelligent zombie. What, is the virus prejudiced?
10. When Byeon Chan turned, he didn't look like a normal zombie. It looked like he became an intelligent zombie. This is never addressed, and we never find out either way. Maybe they just did it that way for dramatic effect? Not a good move.
11. What was the point of the assemblywoman? Why was she in the story at all?
12. In the end we see Nam Ra seemingly well-adjusted after being out on her own for a few months. How? How is that possible? When we last saw her, her hunger was so bad that she tried to bite On Jo and left because she could no longer hold herself back. So how is it that she's perfectly fine around them now, and that her eye has healed? It doesn't explain anything about that. It just leaves it off trying to make us think she's a cool badass zombie-fighter now, but I'm just left with questions.

I know I'm missing some, but you get my point.

Most of the plot was jumping from one closed-off room with no resources to another. A few ideas they actually do have are foiled by what's going on in the outside world, like phone lines and the internet being cut off. It was fine at first, but the kids never got any smarter and never adjusted to the zombies, so that's all we ever got. To the very end, they had absolutely no control over the situation, which isn't what you want to see in a zombie series.

I have a lot of gripes with this drama, to the point that it negatively impacted my viewing experience. But like I said, it was fun at first. I do recommend at least watching the first half because some of it is a lot of fun, but don't expect anything more than a few good scenes and some light comedy in the first few episodes. After that, decide for yourself if you want to suffer through the mess that is the second half.

A struggle to watch
All of Us Are Dead is South Korea's latest entry into their increasing array of zombie productions. The hype surrounding this drama since its teasers and trailers was real, further proven by the amount of enthusiasm shown by worldwide viewers as the drama was finally released on Netflix. I, myself, was among those who were excited for this drama's release, but after watching the entirety of its episodes, I found it disappointing to say the least.

The main problem I had with this drama is its writing. It has major issues— full of plotholes, repetitiveness, inconsistencies and wasted potential. I was most disappointed with how they didn't utilize Nam Ra's abilities as a half-zombie well enough. Instead of letting the group face the same pattern of finding a safe place to hide, having them argue with one another and moving to another safe place over and over again which eventually got really tiring to watch, they could've made room for a more dynamic plot by having Nam Ra use her abilities to help them escape the school earlier. This would've allowed some extra time that can be used to further develop the characterizations which fell shallow for some of the characters. Until the end, I wasn't able to sympathize with a lot of these characters despite having went though 12 whole episodes full of tragedy and loss alongside them. I had a big problem rooting for the female lead in particular due to her general blandness. Her character wasn't interesting nor engaging enough even compared to several of the supporting characters, such as Jang Ha Ri and Park Mi Jin.

There was also a lot of pointless plotlines throughout the drama. To name a few, Gwi Nam's revenge against Cheong San (did he seriously think the police were still going to sit behind their desks processing reports when the entire city has gone to hell ?), the assemblywoman who served absolutely no purpose whatsoever, the hunt for Lee Byeong Chan's laptop because he claimed it contained the key to finding a cure when it turned out to only be a recording of him saying there was no cure, and even On Jo's father's dramatic yet HIGHLY PREVENTABLE death.

The drama also tries to address real life issues such as bullying, sexual harassment, academic and social pressure in attempt to create a woke statement of some sort but it doesn’t add to much. It’s just there to be there. I think having Eun Ji epically stand off against the bully, both as half zombies, would have helped in this aspect, as little as it might.

It wasn't all that bad, though. I enjoyed the action sequences. It's obvious they spent a lot of effort and budget into creating those scenes. The props, makeup, and choreography for the zombies were amazing. Though having some noticeable mistakes and inconsistencies, the action was gripping and suspenseful enough to push you to continue watching. Characters such as Nam Ra, Su Hyeok, Cheong San, Ha Ri, Mi Jin, detective Jae Ik, his partner, and even Na Yeon at times helped made this drama more lively.

The acting range of this drama was mixed. As expected, it was a total delight watching Lee Kyu Hyung's onscreen performance. Several of the younger actors did a great job as well, namely Jo Yi Hyun (Nam Ra), Yoon Chan Young (Cheong San) Yoo In Soo (Gwi Nam) and Lee Yoo Mi (Na Yeon). The rest were either okay or lacking.

The finale sort of picked up the drama a bit. It's because they finally utilized Nam Ra's character properly, having her fight in the frontlines instead of standing around in the back.

All in all, All of Us Are Dead is quite mediocre. It was a fun watch to kill time, but nothing more.

Zombie genre overdone: Long and Boring
After watching trailer, I thought it was going to be an entertaining and different as it involves school but it had the same troops like other zombie movies.
Good points:
1. The production value is great. The scene where the students burst out of the windows while the girl was trying to commit suicide was highlight shot . Even during bomb blast thing, the zombies gathering was amazing.
2. The acting of all the actors were quite on point specially antagonist did a great job.

Bad points:
1. Why was it 12 episodes? It just dragged the whole show with unnecessary things added. The editing is to be blamed.
2. How can students turn into superman while fighting and even old firefighter father can do that kind flips? Moreover, the small baby survived without milk for that many days. Even the students had that much of energy without eating or drinking for days. That's so unrealistic.
3. There are countless number of stupid decisions that restricted from building up any emotion towards any of the character.
4. The emotion of friendship between teenagers looked so force from the beginning like On-Jo didn't even called out or searched for her best friend at the very beginning of zombie attack at cafeteria even after they got out of the vulnerable situation but she suddenly feels bad for her at the time when she was converting into zombie. Don't get that thing??
5. The sound track other than the theme song, is so bad. How can you play comic sound track in those intense scenes? And want us to feel the pain of the characters while being chased by zombies.

Disappointing!!

Dam .... I Cant believe I watched this
Okay to say the show was extremely different is saying the least, after squid game I really didn't think I could do a another freaky show, but I was proven wrong.

So this drama I am at a lost for words, because even though It was good in the sense the acting and cinematography was really excellent, and the visual effects were out of this world, I did find that by the time I reached ep 7 I started to get a little bored, mainly because it just felt that the drama was going nowhere, we got to see how the zombies were created and the reason behind them being created, but the whole running away and hiding the fighting between the remaining survivors started to over lap each other. he first episode was compelling and was such a gorefest, I thought it is exactly how I want my horror show. The very first attack by the school nurse was heart stopping and showed a lot of promise.

The story is simple enough but could have been a goldmine of ideas and exciting scenarios. Instead, they dropped stupid and repetitive scenarios one after another. Some of the plots and characters were what seemed to be wasted time space, like the assembly woman what was her reason for being there and the people around her, the vlog guy, he didn't seem to vlog much and was caught on the roof, the police guy that rescued the baby and the child but only to see them get caught and separated. Then out of no where you got a mutation of the some of the characters that just seemed to endless.

This felt like the drama could have been in done 6 episodes instead of the full 12, cuz in the end the military bombed the town up, for me also, I could not get my head around why the commander shot himself after dropping the bomb, there was literally no other way to stop the zombies from entering the main towns, and causing a major chaos, there was no cure or vaccine so why did he feel like he need to end his life?

Overall: The ending has left us all questioning is there a season 2 coming? If zombies and gruesome is your thing then yes watch it, for me this is not something I will watch again, but i did find enjoyable on a 50/50 scale.

This series started in such an exciting, groundbreaking way. If you ever ask me about my favorite episodes in a drama ever, the first few episodes of this show would probably be a runner up. At the start, the concepts were promising, the characters were interesting, and the cinematography was amazing. The cafeteria scene was freaking epic. Now, THIS is a freaking zombie show! I thought to myself. I can't wait to see more thrilling scenes with zombies and action and tension! Well sadly. The show was exciting until it wasn't.

Characters: 3/5
As the series went on I could not bring myself to root for anyone, especially the main leads. They were just very stale. Even Su-hyeok, who I found very charming at the start, eventually became boring to watch too. I think Gwi-nam was the most memorable character. He may not have been one of the, 'good guys' but he was DEFINITELY interesting to watch. All these characters, who we know nothing about like their motivations or fears , a guy with seemingly no desire other than to kill WAS fun to watch. Dae-soo, the archery girl, and the delinquent were likeable, but also lack depth like the others. The detective showed some promise, but he eventually fades into the background. Characters are also introduced despite changing nothing about the story. Like why was the vlogger even there...

Story: 1/5
Now, my main complaint, the story. It was puzzling, that in a show centered around HIGHSCHOOLERS in a ZOMBIE virus the emotional intensity that was portrayed cannot be felt at all. Even if the characters cried, argued, or fought, I felt so detached as a viewer that I just didn't care. Deaths were also very anticlimactic and had no impact. Some were even stupid. Clearly the dad did NOT need to fire a second light for the zombies to go away!! They set up this whole epic rescue mission of the dad just for him to die by locking himself in a court with zombies. Like why!! Anyways, the big chunk of teenage melodrama should also be discussed. I'm not the type to hate those types of stories, but if you don't care about the people involved, it becomes tasking to watch. Arguably the most boring part of the show.

Like alot of things, it's not all bad. I did still enjoy some parts of the story. Nam-ra's arc was nice and I liked how she developed. The scene of their campfire at the rooftop with Dae-soo singing was heartwarming. There were fun parts but the excitement eventually dies down a lot, and any tension that might have been previously felt in the story was eventually gone and depleting in the last few episodes. I have no energy to talk about the ending.

Acting: 5/5
I don't have much to say about the acting. Everyone did great! I'm not familiar with the main cast, but I think that the actors did really well with the script they were given. The zombie extras did great in being zombies. Notably, I liked Yoo In Soo's performance. I'm looking out for his future roles soon!

Cinematography: 5/5
Again, nothing much to say. As I expected from Netflix, this show definitely looks amazing. I like how the camera angles were shot, especially in the cafeteria scene (yes, i really like that scene) and also the library scene. Generally I just think the cinematography is great. Sidenote, I love how they shot this in a 16:9 ratio too. It fits the theme well.

So, the cinematography is great, the cast did amazingly, but the biggest downside is the writing was not well done at all. Anyways, I don't despise this show, and deep inside I really wish it still succeeds. The actors and the crew clearly put a lot of hardwork into this series, and I'd hate for it to go to waste.

Overall, ""All of Us Are Dead"" is a show that could have been something much, much bigger. I feel more sad than disappointed, because this COULD have been a great show. I'm left pondering with a lot of what-ifs. What if this happened, what if they did this instead of that and a lot of other useless thoughts. I really wish this was a show I could have enjoyed.

Rewatch value is also probably a 2/5, because I'd definitely still watch the first 3 episodes again (only).

Enjoyable but a lot of things are questionable
Overall it’s worth watching if you enjoy grotesque zombie scenes but there are questionable scenes from time to time. You just have to shut your brain while watching it.

You can feel how desperate these high school kids to survive. I laugh, cried, got annoyed and felt everything.

Bullying was the first problem in this series that was not properly addressed.

This experience with zombies form friendship and bond between the leads. Although not a good experience but it made the experience special.

Definitely worth a watch if you are not fussy about details.

You'll get annoyed by sooo many characters but you’ll be surprised how some kids can smartly think of ways to survive.

I can rewatch it but might have to skip some scenes.

Overall 7.5/10 for me.

Give it a try, I'm sure you’ll be curious on what will happen next and will keep on playing the next episodes until your done!

Amazing if you like zombie horror
I finished this show in 2 days, and it's been a while since i've done that. But it was deffinetly worth it.

The acting was supreme and so was the story.
The twists and the plot and everything about it.

I was on the edge of my seat with every episode and it was imposible to stop watching.
I have started a lot of kdramas with themes like this but i easily give up on them, here that was impossible.

Some people say this was boring but that was deff not the case for me.

WATCH!

Zombiecalypse nightmare


All of Us Are Dead is South Korea's latest entry into its esscalating body of undead mayhem (Train to Busan, #Alive, Happiness).

All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who've managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse. With 12 episodes running 1 hr long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence, yet it sticks to the basics and delivers a positive outcome, although there's nothing new.

All of Us Are Dead's zombie action is never not impressive. Whether it's giant chaotic crowd shots, massive ensemble brawls, or tricky ""oners,"" this is massively kinetic storytelling that will drain you as emotionally as it drains our heroes physically. Likewise, there are dozens of instances involving astounding body acting.

All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.

My Rating : 7.5/10

I don't really like zombie dramas
I'm aware that zombie dramas will have their fanbase, so let me preface this by saying that I am not part of it.... Anyway, I thought this drama was entertaining enough, but not particularly interesting. Like it is interesting enough to entertain?

About the plot:
? Interesting at the start, I think the main point of this drama is just the action and gore so I'm not sure how I should rate this. I have to say the drama was very interesting in the beginning but lost traction slowly. Many many plot armours, like how do the main characters survive from the most ridiculous things? There's not much plot honestly, there's barely any progression throughout the series. It's just filled with action, gore and thrill. Oh yes, and the occasional (irrelevant) romance? I mean it's a school drama after all, so maybe it was added to lighten the mood a little. I do love the childhood friends stuff going on but ... Onjo randomly bringing in romance and boys like... THERE ARE ZOMBIES EVERYWHERE AND YOU JUST WANT TO TALK/THINK ABOUT YOUR STUPID ROMANCE?? There's a time and place for everything and the majority of the romantic scenes are useless af. Overall, I think this drama wasn't even meant to have much of a plot? (or at least I hope so, if not it's pretty much a bigass failure of a plot) If you just compile the parts of the drama with a plot, this wouldn't be a 12-episode series, it would be halved or something.

About the acting/cast:
The main casts are obviously school-aged kids but the others.. there are ""kids"" who are obviously adults like, no questions asked (even among the main casts' friend group). They look way too old to look the part o.o I'm sorry but On-jo is so freaking expressionless, I cannot fathom how she even got the part? There are side characters who are much better at acting.

About the music/OST:
Appropriate for the scenes.

Rewatch value:
As mentioned, I don't usually watch zombie stuff. I'm watching it to just... find out more about the drama.

Best zombie series
Where do I even start? This series is so good and went above and beyond what I expected it to be. The acting, scenes, and everything was good. I love how they also didn't focus on a specific group of people for the whole series and basically, you get to see how everybody is dealing with the zombie outbreak.

This series is a series where you are on the edge of your seat, you'll cry or feel sad, or you will be angry by the outcome or people in the series, other scenes you will feel relieved. The way the actors portrayed the characters was honestly insane (in a good way), they really make you feel like you are watching them in an actual zombie outbreak. I also love the way everything ties together throughout the series as well.

I definitely would rewatch this series however many times because I'm still not over it yet. If you haven't seen this yet watch it right now, you won't regret it.

awesome start, questionable ending.
I am thrilled by this series, it is great.
I wouldn’t say this would be my 100% favorite zombie series, but it’s worth the wait.
Even my parents was fascinated by it.

Story: 9

This no difference from other zombie movies/series, the plot is kinda mess up but the way
they did the story about highschool students trying to survive an zombie outbreak was kinda interesting.
I also thought this was all about zombies, so I didn’t expect this to be a tear-jerker.

Acting/Cast: 7
I am impressed by Yoon Chan Young/Lee Cheong San his acting was magnificent, he deserves
more recognition he’s the reason why I continue watching but I couldn’t believe what they did to him,
his character was also okay there is no reason to hate him.

My least favorite would be Park Ji Hoo/Nam Oh Joo, I kinda hate her character and her acting wasn’t
that good, but it wasn’t that bad for a rookie. She couldn’t match her emotions to her facial expressions
and can’t even cry. Her character was also annoying, no no not annoying but dumb she moves to slow
which every zombie main character do which I had enough of lol.
However, I do not have reason to hate her I am only giving my opinion about the series.

Nam Ra is also one of the best character.

Most of my favorite characters vanished like Han Kyung Soo, Imagine saving your classmate ass
then you’ll get re payed by someone turning you into a zombie, just evil.
I am glad that she got her karma back, cause Na Yeon girl you deserve it.

The headache I got from Gwi Nam, gosh he’s even more annoying mala cardo dalisay.
I couldn’t stand him every episode he would fall then come back alive.
His acting though was really impressive, deserves a recognition.

I also couldn’t stand Eun Ji and Cheol Soo, I just think that there screen time is a waste.
They are both annoying, though pathetic. I wish they could have Eun Ji and Gwi Nam fight
instead cause wouldn’t that be interesting, so atleast Eun Ji can get revenge.

For the support roles, they did great, some of their actings was stiff but still i love them.

Music: 8

All I remember was the songs Dae Soo was singing so for that I would give an 8, he’s voice
was so good, I am too lazy to even search the ost.

This series is great for binge watching, but I have no intention to even rewatch this.
Too much headache for meeee.

Overall: 8.5

what the hell is this romance ass garbo
ait so i thought it was going to be an alright show by the first two episodes.. there was some unecessary romance but I was like whatever I hope they don't drag this out.
Well, they did!
Not only did they drag the romance out, but they also dragged out ALL THE OTHER SCENES IN THE SERIES! seriously, why are they trying to redeem EVERY single character?? Oh the girl who killed an innocent guy feels bad? let's give her 30 minutes of an episode where she sobs and has a breakdown with BAD soundtrack playing. Don't even get me started on the ass soundtrack, it was SO. SO SO BAD. I know kdramas struggle with soundtracks but jesus christ this shit made me laugh at every death scene. The ending sucks absolute balls. what was that. ?????????????why were everybody shocked???what???what was that suspenful music?

Some people are complaining about plot holes but honestly there was no plot. Literally what was the plot. It didn't make sense. You kill off the most important character in the most anti-climatic way, but still keep showing videos of him.................. what
Btw the scientist could've been AN AMAZING VILLAIN, BUT INSTEAD THEY KEPT GOING WITH THE ANNOYING AS MF BULLY. WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT HIM. ""but a villain is made to be hated"" stfu he was the most boring villain ever, i was sleeping through all his scenes. Watching this series was a whole ass chore and I can't believe I wasted 12+ hours watching it. why. why.?`?!?!??!!?!?

the cast was ait but like, i aint gonna give it a higher rating because of it?????? and some of them were so mehhh on god.

Who's idea was it to make a kdrama off this shitty webtoon anyways? the webtoon's artstyle is ass and I wont bother reading it because the characters and plot suck ass. At least the shitty soundtrack isn't in the webtoon...

this series could've been saved if the villain had ANY personality, if the cringe ass mf romance was removed (omfg that shit made me so mad like idc if yall want to kiss and fuck omfg istg these straights be making me insane), if THE PLOT MADE ANY SENSE AND IF THE SERIES STOPPED GIVING ALL CHARACTERS REDEMPTION ARCS. thank you. dont watch this shit. watch kingdom instead (an actual good zombie kdrama).

WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS????
I'll start with saying this is not gonna be a review just questioning something that happened but didnt see anyone talk about yet. Now if u didnt watch the show yet DO NOT CONTINUE AS THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!

I kept on waiting and waiting but something just didnt add up.
In ep1 , when the first girl that got infected by the hamster, was brought to the school infirmary, she actually bit Ohn Jo but she never turned or showed any signs . why ? is she immune? could she have been a way to get a vaccine or something?
but thats not as important. i went back to rewatch the scene and she definetly got bitten or at least hurt by that girl. how did they just leave it like that?
first of all thats such wasted potential for the plot line but then again why did they add it in the first play . homegirl got bitten and NOTHING happens to her like what?
did anyone else notice that or am i starting to see things????

A fun ride with some inconsistencies
Is how I would describe the experience that is All Of Us Are Dead. After feeling let down by Netflix last few darker K-dramas, my expectations for this were rather low, but looking back on it, I am actually surprisingly pleased with this series.

All Of Us Are Dead is an eye-catching show in many ways. For starters it definitely didn’t hold back when it came to gore and edge. Which I greatly appreciate actually. I wasn’t familiar with the source material but when I originally read the summary, I was under the impression that a highschool setting meant, that the target audience of All Of Us Are Dead were supposed to be teenagers and that the violence would be accordingly mild. Let me tell you, it is everything but. I can’t remember the last time I saw so many heads rolling and guts spilling out. Truly a sight to behold.
Aside from that, I think this series has pretty solid cinematography. The shot composition was visually stimulating most of the time. I think the simplistic single-camera really shined here. The action- and fight scenes were choreographed surprisingly well. Honestly the shows look is at its best, when all hell breaks loose. Suspension was high. I was on the edge of my seat throughout numerous scenes.
I really enjoyed the performance of our female protagonist Ohn-jo. She was my favorite character by far but I feel like I am in the minority here, as I have read countless complaints about her being annoying. I actually can’t relate to that sentiment at all, I found it very easy to root for the female lead. I haven’t watched any of the actress previous work but considering that she is rather young and seemingly inexperienced, I thought she did a pretty convincing job.
I also appreciated the rare moments of comedy (well, most of them, not sure what to make of the two cops to be honest). They didn’t feel out of place to me, instead they were much needed to take off some edge from this dark dark drama.
In the series’ more humane moments, feel like I got to connect with most of the cast and got an idea of their dynamic with each other. In a very weird way, I was reminded of The Breakfast Club, the way our group of widely different angsty teens were forced to work and bond together. Just, you know, with more people dying. A lot more. While you have characters getting killed off left and right, most deaths felt impactful, which is difficult to pull off when your body-count is this high. This for me signifies that All Of Us Dead did a solid job with setting up its characters and making me care for them, even if their screentime was comparably short.

But this show sadly also has its dull moments. I am not going to list every single plothole, for the sake of avoiding spoilers and also because this isn’t Cinema Sins. Also, unpopular opinion, I don’t care that much about stuff like that. This is a zombie series; my disbelief is already suspended. The only real crime you can commit as a story about the flesh-eating undead, is bore me, which this show definitely did not. Still, you have to accept some level of idiocrasy going into this. If logic is terribly important to you, I imagine that you will be frustrated a lot here. Everyone behaves rather irrational but I mean, they’re teenagers. That’s what they do. Still, I can understand where the outcry is coming from, multiple moments don’t make a whole lot of sense if you really think about them for longer than a second.
I appreciated All Of Us Are Dead's attempt of social commentary but I don’t know if it was always warranted here. I don’t think zombie films have to be dumb, if you have something important to say, by all means go ahead. But I think this show tried to say so much, that it ended up conveying very little. Maybe pick a message and stick to that one to avoid feeling like an After School Special. At its best, All Of Us Are Dead’s societal critique felt a bit preachy and on the nose. At its worst it felt entirely out of place and took me out of the story.
The pacing started off great. The plot was developing fast and I was fully immersed in the experience. And then somewhere along the way All Of Us Are Dead got kind of lost with segments that took up way too much time. The last few episodes felt a bit draggy as a result. I don’t mind the typically ambiguous Netflix ending but since we started off so strong and plot-dense it seems like we got a lot of set-up with comparably little pay-off.
I struggle a bit when it comes to evaluating acting- I can vaguely tell what makes a story good or bad. Or what makes a cinematography less or more interesting. I don’t possess the same talent when it comes to performances, it’s even more difficult to me when it’s in a foreign language. But for once I can point at one specific performance and go “Wow that was not exactly great”. That critique goes to the actress of Nam-ra. I am so used to Korean actors doing too much, honestly, overacting is part of the charm when it comes to Asian dramas. Well for the first time ever I witnessed a K-drama actress doing too little, it was honestly kind of puzzling to me. I understand that being stoic is part of the character but Nam-ra’s actress just gave me nothing, absolutely nothing at all. Maybe it’s because most of the time she did not have anything interesting to do, besides saying pseudo poignant things at the entirely wrong time. Her chemistry with her love-interest (who is also a rather bland character) was also close to non-existent, by the end I honestly shipped her more with our female protagonist.
Speaking of romance, it also belongs to the show’s weaker qualities. I didn’t mind Cheong-sans and Ohn-jo’s developing relationship that much, but maybe this is due to my weakness for the Friends-to-lovers-trope. The love triangle???square??? though, felt entirely unnecessary and took up way too much time. It’s incredible that everyone had time for this petty drama while they had all these zombies to deal with.

I sometimes curse the day Train To Busan premiered. It seems like the existence of the movie alone has made it impossible for people to critique any piece of Korean media with zombies in it, without somehow comparing it to Sang-Ho Yeons masterpiece. Even in universe the title has to be somehow referenced, apparently, it’s just unavoidable.
Listen, is this the next Train To Busan? No, absolutely not. But I don’t think it has or tried to be. I think there is an important dissonance between entertaining and objectively great. At its best, All Of Us Are Dead was both but even at its worst I was still having fun, and at the end of the day, isn’t that what really counts?

DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM ⁉️
Summary: Happiness > All of us are dead

I wished they got better main leads, i liked the supporting characters better (Especially the 2nd group of survivors , hari, mijin and the 2 guys) better than the boring main cast. The story was nice but nothing to rave about.
Some characters are just plain stupid like the mom of one of the main guys.
What i hated is that they just bombed the whole city instead of finding a cure.
The story as a whole is just very unclear on how the actual virus started and series just ended like huh? I wouldn’t say it’s a cliffhanger cause it’s not wanting me to see more episodes or another season.

no lo mejor que ha hecho netflix
Nunca escribo reviews, pero enserio ni era necesario ese nivel de violencia para algunas partes y otras entonces fueron muy lame, diálogos vacíos, final como inventado, nada que ver, entiendo que sea de tipo zombie drama pero en los últimos capítulos llegó al punto de ser demasiado incluso para alguien que está acostumbrado a ver gore, sobretodo con el personaje que más me gustaba y su muerte. ¿cuál fue el punto de todo si siempre que llegaban a algo había un punto de quiebre y había que perder a alguien? y hubiese estado bien pero había espacio para mejoras del guión porque la verdad muchas muertes fueron innecesarias, incluso personajes que era mejor que no sobrevivieran, la verdad no entendí muchas escenas, en fin, un desastre.

Got Me Back Into Anything Other Than Books!
I really liked this, especially with my low standards for movies and shows. It's a surprise that not only did I actually enjoy it, but it was a consistent watch instead of me avoiding it for several days.

The problem that lies in All of Us Are Dead is repetition, the amount of times Gwi-Nam gets thrown off of a building is insane along with the build-up being quite lacklustre by the time its finishes (ex. On-Jo's father), but you can't expect much from anything anymore, so I'm used to it.

It's decent and I love Cho Yi-Hyun and her character, Nam-Ra, way too much to hate it in any way. I also loved the character of Na-Yeon and Lee Yoo Mi as an actress as well.

What is the point...?
The premise of All of Us Are Dead is simple: a group students try their best to stay alive while being trapped in their school through a zombie apocalypse. When I first heard about this drama and saw the talent attached to the project, I thought this was a promising story.

After watching it, I feel mostly lukewarm about it. Sadly, most of the developments that don’t sit well with me are major spoilers, so I won’t be sharing it. Instead, I will be talking about what I liked about it and what didn’t quite reach the potential it had.

What I like the most was that I got to watch the story from several perspectives, from desperate teen survivor, detective and the framed science teacher, to military and political government. The different points of view on what to do in this situation was very interesting.

The first half of the drama was very compelling. Its rhythm fast paced and adrenaline infused but also took its time to develop characters and their inner and outer demons. In the final six episodes the story shifts and the drama suffers from it a little.

The acting is a mixed bag. The adult performers do a solid job but it’s the young talent where it flattered. I personally think what is really attracting people to watch this drama, more than the story, is the charming new actors and actresses. Particularly Park Solomon, whom I admit is a find and probably the next big thing. I can see a little of Go Soo in him and that should tell you everything you need to know. Lee Eun-saem and Ha Seung-ri are another two really strong performances. But the most impactful presence is Lee Yoo Mi who demonstrates the meaning of the word range.

The zombie action is top notch, no surprise coming from a korean production. It is gory and blood thirsty. Their origin story, however, it’s one of the things that just don’t sit well with me.

The school violence, bullying and sexual abuse display in this drama is far more disturbing than the actual zombies. I am sure this was the intention, so we as an audience can understand and empathize with the logic behind the creation of the zombies. The adult solution to the problem is anarchy and destruction. From this situation, a group of kids is left to figure out what’s morally correct, ethical behavior, justice, the importance of kindness, and so on. Lord of the Flies: Zombie Edition.

This is the point where I am left wondering if this is what of All Of Us Are Dead is actually about. Is this a gore fest showing me the worst a human can do? People so detached to what others feel, so already dead inside, that everything they do is worse than what a zombie does? Is this a brutal bullying survivor story? But then why none of the main characters were part of the bullied? Or someone who stood up to the bullies before the zombie apocalypse? Or part of the bullying storyline at all?

As I mentioned before, I found the conclusion of this series lukewarm, up in the air, as I am sure it was the intention since Netflix or the powers at the studio who produced this drama are probably wishing for a second season. Or more.

Overall, if you like zombies stories, you might as well give it chance.

A Thrilling Modern-Day Apocalyptic Drama with Emotional Compelling Scenes
This is a drama centering not simply around humans vs. zombies, but themes of team work, love and friendship as well in the face of a modern-day zombie-like virus outbreak that spreads across a high school in the city of Hyosan. It follows a group of high school students as they attempt to communicate with outside rescue authorities and fight for survival. What would you do if you wound up trapped inside your high school rife with flesh-eating monsters roaming the halls, classrooms, gym, cafeteria and field left and right? Among them are your homeroom teacher, that kid who sat next to you in math, and even your best friend of ten years, looking bloody and repulsive, driven by a primal desire to eat you and your human friends up for dinner, making the person you once knew no longer recognizable. A team of courageous and smart teens joined forces. Together they stave off and combat these zombies, along with a number of emotional challenges tied to loss, betrayal, sacrifice and longing. And in the midst of it all, they must put up a fight because the only way out is through.

The gameplan? First, find a temporary base safe and isolated from the hordes of zombies. Next, plan and strategize by considering all accessible and useful tools in the vicinity. Employ logic to skillfully weigh the risks of every move. Finally, at the right moment, execute, and pray for the best, doing all their bodies could withstand to adapt to the unforeseen obstacles standing in the way that could rock the boat.

I thoroughly enjoyed the thoughtful communication style and interactions of the characters. I fully immersed myself in both their playful banter as well as vulnerable heart-to-hearts. Showed that it’s in times of crises such as these that a solid support system and boosts of morale serve as providers of hope. A meaningful reminder that bad moments are plenty but life must go on, so never lose hope. My favorite character absolutely has to be Nam-ra, the class president. Beneath her quiet and standoffish demeanor is a warm and affectionate girl with a level-headedness and quick thinking skills that truly came in clutch and saved the team multiple times in critical, sticky situations.

If you’re one to catch plot holes like a hawk, it’s been made known to me, judging by other reviews I’ve read, that you might as well not start watching since all you’re going to feel is frustration as you attempt to wrap your head around certain scenarios. I, for one, felt like none of the characters had acted out-of-character or anything at any point during the series. I found myself easily able to empathize and shed tears of joy and sorrow with every character. They’re so young, yet strong. If you are like me and are just looking for good, exciting entertainment to get your cardiovascular game on on a calm evening, this is the show for you! Have a snack in hand to indulge in because this drama will keep your eyes glued to the screen for a while. Although a lot of the show does picture grotesque, gorey zombies digging into human insides and (surprisingly well-shot) action scenes, it was certainly not without its share of heart-fluttering sweet romantic moments between the leads, comedic reliefs, and genuine, raw emotions.

I encourage all to give this a shot. It is captivating and binge-worthy.

my thought
this review may or may not contain spoilers .

this show started very boringly to be honest it didn't give any moves till episode .5 it gradually changed and became better with the storyline ,what surprised me the most is their acting i did really enjoy it good actors and actresses .

it is so far my favorite zombie action after (train to busan ) , but the whole gap that it makes is the camera work and music this show lacks music in general that it what made it boring in the start.

i would not rewatch any shows if i dont miss it , and with zombies i dont think i would lol so rewatch value is zero with this one .


overall it could be better but this is good and i love it as simple as that.

A sombre apocalypse
Calling this an enjoyable watch feels wrong given I was holding in my stomach for most of it, either at the nail-biting tension or the exploding moments of gore and blood. But it was an excellent show. It built up the sense of crisis, the hopelessness and through it, the characters. The relationships that were formed were organically done and realistic, and thus made you root for characters sometimes simply because of what they meant to everyone else. This show did really well in highlighting the importance of family and social rootedness because people are stronger when compassion is plentiful. I've always found Korean shows to be thoughtful in the social analysis of these things and this show hinted well at that.

The other thing they did well with was the issue of survivors' guilt. Living on felt very difficult for characters but giving up was a betrayal of the memory and sacrifice of those who died for them to live. I thought the show was beautifully written in that way. The casting was good and there was an innocent charm to a lot of these characters, who ultimately, were just teenagers having a very rotten school week.

The standout character was Nam-ra and her ending was beautiful and deserved. Her struggle for clinging onto her humanity manifesting in that feral shriek of despair at the end really underlined the sheer goodness of her character, her overwhelming desire to hold onto the essence of who she is and not give in. I give the show 5 stars for how it wrote her, she quickly grew into the most interesting character.

The show had some excellent sections. Moments when they were trapped in one place for too long only to escape and get trapped elsewhere within the school and then during the second half of the show when their movement was more fluid and constant simply because staying in one place, they realised, was just delaying the impending doom. The final two episodes of the show blew me away because many things I did not expect to happen took place. Even though the ending was a little foreshadowed, it was a deserved one but everything else during those final episodes left me stunned. In a zombie apocalypse, there are no main characters with plot armour.

There were things I didn't like. Far too many characters had heroic deaths to the point where it sort of lost value. It was more gripping when people are trying to escape but the zombies take them. I think the hero complex was a real problem with Cheong-San. I liked him a lot but I was tired by his need to always elect himself as the sacrificial lamb for the group. I also thought how his death came about was foolish. They were all just standing there while he was slowly getting attacked. it didn't make sense especially given Nam-ra's superhuman feats that she just stood there.

Then there is Nayeon's character. I cannot accept that she purposefully infected someone just to be proven right. Her death was sad in that the group didn't realise she had only died due to her desire for redemption. I was a little annoyed at first before I realised it worked out better like this. It would have been too neat for her to reconnect with them.

My main issue perhaps, is the idea that this virus began because someone's dad got fed up with school bullying and decided humanity was irredeemable and evil. You're telling me that's how everyone got infected? I lost all sympathy with him when he was talking about how the system failed his son because of what he then transpired to do. There were also some payoffs I was waiting for, such as the girl who got videotaped getting her revenge during the apocalypse but the show didn't even hint towards that.

Those were my only real complaints, because otherwise it was an entirely excellent show.

Disastrous show
What to say about this train wreck of a show… I disliked every single aspect of it. I’m a huge fan of korean zombie shows and movies but this drama is just an embarrassment. I don’t understand how it became popular in the first place, as it has 0 redeeming qualities to it.

I’m truly infuriated and disgusted with myself for having even watched it until the end. I guess I was hoping for the plot to deliver what it promised but it was full of clichés, repetitions, stupid useless scenes and characters, anti-climatic outcomes and everything bad a story can have. I’ll forgive the acting (the older actors were good though) because most of these people are pretty new in the game and they’re young, but the acting was pretty bad too. The characters were useless, unlikeable, unrealistic, their actions made no sense and their worries (crushes????like wtf????) were meaningless most of the time. And the inconsistencies with the way the infected acted (how long it took them to turn etcetc) just pissed me off. The way the story was told as a whole isn’t coherent or interesting.

To be fair, it could have been really good if they had wasted less time with irrelevant storylines, if had organized the way it’s presented in a more thrilling way, if they had made the characters and their reactions more realistic and logical… I could go on for a whole hour. But maybe it would have been a decent drama had it been released in 2014 or something. The thing is, especially if you compare it to actually amazing zombie movies and shows, namely Train to Busan and Kingdom, this is honestly just ridiculous.

Zombies are zombies but are they zombies?
So, I'm writing this review in my not-so-usual manner, it's a bit disorganized but I hope you enjoy reading this!
There might be minor spoilers ahead, I hope you could proceed with caution!

To sum up this drama in a statement, it's all about ""Here zombie, there zombie, everywhere zombie-zombie"" and also, an even perfect explanation, let's have our own Hermoine-Ron story or basically, let's kiss with the basilisk around (dead!) (more like zombies here).
Anyways,
to put it simply:
This drama was pretty much alright for me. Though I still believe it wasn't the best zombie drama out there, this still was pretty nice and kept me hooked even though there were a lot of plotholes.
Then, there's something I would like to ask the screenwriter, ""HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF ANTIBODIES TRANSFER?""
I hope they would have consulted some kind of a scientist of somebody of that sort before making up this ridiculous plot-hole of Gwi Nam biting Nam-Ra who doesn't fully turn while others do.
Well, I hated the female lead (On Jo) but anyways, I gave the story and cast and all a pretty okay rating because Soo Hyeok and Nam Ra exist!
It would keep you on your toes if you don't try to invest yourself in it and ask every now and then, was this decision right? Don't use your biology knowledge here if you ever want to enjoy this!
That's all I've got to say for this one! I hope you enjoy it if you decide on watching this and don't regret it if you don't cuz it's not a must-watch.
DO YOU LOVE ZOMBIE DRAMAS so much?
Go watch, THE TRAIN TO BUSAN, it's way better but anyways, this was pretty nice as well! (No hate)

Slightly disappointing
As a zombie series fan I was really excited for All Of Us are Dead's premiere, but I ended up being slightly disappointed. I loved the very first episode, it was a very well paced first episode; even though the CG rubbed me off the wrong way but I'm not going to elaborate on that.
I found the show slightly underwhelming because as the episodes went on, the plot wasn't really advancing in any way; every time the students tried to change the spots within the school, the outcome was predictable.
There's a lot of unnecessary subplots and also quite a lot of plot holes that I can't really wrap my head around, but I've figured they did that as a tool for a second season. I did enjoy the friends' dynamic. Though I wished they actually showed more of that. Like the way they were acting before the virus broke out or some characteristics that would make them more three dimensional and not so flat.
Overall, it wasn't a bad show but I had higher expectations from it.

Run
Run is the word you will hear from the mini series

As usual started calm then all breaks loose, ground zero is hyosan high school and a good thing about this mini series is the director stick within ground zero, story is incomplete and for sure, since it was well received there should be a prequel and a sequel.

Actors and Actress gave their natural environment performance, looks like we will be seeing more of the students in the future, kind of a way introducing the young actress and actors in a mini series, this was done in GTO where the young talent started and mentored by senior actors/actress. hoping to see more of Park Ji Hoo, Jo Yi Hyun and Park Solomon in the future korean series.

Music was just ok, but nothing outstanding bgm, hopefully music will be payed attention in the sequel and prequel

Would i rewatch, yes,
Zombie marathon series during the holiday seasons

Overall it is just good, this cannot top kingdom story wise, potential wise, sequel can take where the classroom leader can jump from the a 8 story building, and prequel can take where the virus was found and why?

If you like mystery and zombie series, add this to your list, the actresses are good and park solomon has a potential to take a lead action role in the future.

You need to step into the shoes of the antagonist to watch this drama and its too unnecessarily stretched. The original niche for the drama includes target audience that expect rom-com in any drama they watch and its delivered in a very deliberate manner. It was unnecessary. I mean they are in a virus aka zombie apocalypse which they call it as. The plot is very poor and its quite clear whats going to happen. To continue the story, they are forcibly moving to other places and doing stuff thats not needed or demanding. I just cant write more coz the entire drama is a mess. Sorry to say, but thats the truth. The origin or the concept of patient zero is not at all touched apart from harnessing concepts like teen pregnancy, abuse, social barriers, etc superficially. Instead of focussing on key issues, they just targeted so many random issues all at once with no depth in acting by the novices. The villian is like undefeatable and wasnt promising at all. The other characters didnt have any development. If I had to watch it through my perspective, there should have been much investment on development of story, how the virus originated, at least should have made it understandable. These observations accounts to only 1 or 2% of the experienced mess. The movie goes nowhere expect for the niche expecting a second season.

So much wasted potential...
I've never written a review before, but this is the most frustrating kdramas I've ever watched. If it wasn't for sunk cost fallacy, I would've stopped watching it at ep 6, but I pushed on only to be rewarded with disappointment after disappointment.

My main issue is with the writing. So before I jump into that, I'll say that the drama LOOKED really good. It definitely had that Netflix budget. Some of the acting was top tier. The zombies themselves were convincingly terrifying. Love a surprise Lee Kyu Hyung appearance. A lot of their survival instincts and plans had believable merit.

Unfortunately, these details could not save the show's biggest flaw: the writing.

I think the reason I ended this show feeling so pissed off was because it had so much wasted potential. All the plot threads for a smart, compelling, satisfying drama were there, but they were mostly left hanging. At points, I felt like the writers were actually trolling us by purposely setting up an interesting character arc only to let it fizzle without a purpose. I'll detail the most egregious ones below:

‧ So Ju (On Jo's father) - Set up from the beginning as one of the main story lines, we saw So Ju fight against all odds to prove that a father's love could overcome anything. He was trapped, attacked multiple times, put under lockdown, shot (don't even get me started on how multiple trained soldiers couldn't shoot one man running without cover), gut-punched by a tree and yet he still made his way to the school. Just in time, he manages to randomly (the guy has been through so much, i'll overlook this incredibly unlikely luck) discover On Jo and her friends in a gym detached from the main school building. He somehow breaks a thick metal chain to free them and unites with his daughter. It's touching, it's a relief, it's satisfying. But not 10 minutes later, despite flares working to distract the zombies, he's sacrificing himself for no apparent reason and sending his daughter and crew off to face more unknown dangers on their own again. And that was that. A fleeting payoff followed by a nonsensical self-sacrifice that probably resulted in more characters dying than would've if he'd been there to guide them further.

‧ Gwi Nam (and the bullying storyline) - Yoo In Soo's acting as a villain was really well done. He was appropriately terrifying and fully psychotic. At some point it turned and became comical how many times he popped back up to be a threat, but I still think he was a good villain in theory. However, his hyper-fixation on Chung San and the forced conflict between them was frustrating when the obvious and much better story arc of Eun Ji getting her revenge was RIGHT THERE. Instead, the sympathy that was built up for the bullied duo was dashed by showing them both to be awful people at their core which sent a really weird message. Also, what was the point of Eun Ji going back to light the school on fire? My expectation was that our main group would find themselves trapped on the roof as the fire spread and needing to make an escape, but instead we got a few lit up pieces of paper and then... nothing. Let's also not forget that there's implication that Soo Hyeok used to run with Gwi Nam's crowd meaning he was probably a pretty awful bully himself up until recently and yet we're supposed to see him as one of the most likable and righteous members of the main group.

‧ The wasted potential of so many fleeting characters and pointless introductions - What was the point of the pregnant high school student? What did that story beat add to the drama? What was the significance? Just to eventually give the cops something to do? Same with the youtuber. He could've been used as a plot vehicle to show the outside world what was really going on but instead he existed just to take up screen time. Now, don't get me wrong. One of my favorite parts of the show was the cop duo. They had great chemistry and Lee Kyu Hyung just brings his A game to every supporting character he plays. Unfortunately, as soon as they left the police station, their purpose in the story disappeared. Better drama?: Following the two cops as they went around saving people. Better plot thread?: Letting them be the ones who retrieved the laptop. The writing robbed them of their one useful job in the story halfway through the drama. What about the assemblywoman? What was her purpose aside from delaying So Ju from saving his daughter? It was mentioned that she had kids so the least they could've done was reveal that one of the main students was her child. It would've made her a hundred times more compelling and it would've given her a deeper connection with So Ju. Wouldn't have been awesome if her child was Nam Ra? Or Na Yeon?! It was all right there and just never capitalized on. I'll just briefly mention the wasted potential of the caring teacher, the brother/sister connection (Woo Jin was given so little development/to do as a character that I didn't even realize he existed until the group was thinned out by zombies), the military commander...

‧ Na Yeon. Sigh. We were absolutely baited by the potential of a well rounded character arc. Like many of the characters, she was just a bad, cruel person for no real discernible reason. Lots of high school students are catty or dramatic or brats, but they don't have it in them to just murder fellow classmates in a survival situation because they feel left out and ignored. But in directly and purposely sending Gyeong Soo to his death isn't the worst thing about her character - it's what happens after that. We see her hiding in the closet, stocked up with food and drinks (let me say here that the lack of attention to the fact that the students haven't had food/real water in days is odd), and she seems truly and emotionally remorseful. Surely, she's going to provide them with sustenance and win a little of their forgiveness, right? No. She hears them talking bad about her and stays put. Fine. Surely they're just upping the drama to make her revealing herself more impactful, right? No. We finally see her snapping out of her pathetic pity party and packing things up to meet them. We get an odd flashback to the teacher (another person who dies unnecessarily because of Na Yeon's selfishness and stupidity) begging her to make amends and do something helpful for the group to redeem herself. If you squint, there's even a potentially possibility that maybe she WASN'T the one who infected Gyeong Soo after all. The set up is there. She'll save them by providing food and water and apologize. She'll explain her motivations further. Wrong. She dies. Maybe. We don't really see her turn for sure so maybe she's alive or turned into one of those hybrids. Okay, writers. Surely, SURELY this means we're going to see her pop up in the future, somehow saving the group or sacrificing herself to give her story some kind of satisfying closure? Wrong again. We get a pan shot of the zombies in a future episode and there she is. So. That's that then.

‧ The On Ju/Cheong San relationship - We know from the very beginning that he's into her. We assume that she's also hiding the fact that she's into him. But that doesn't ever really happen. She seems fully focused on her crush on Soo Hyeok up until Cheong San confesses to her. She responds with anger saying she's now lost him as a friend (which isn't necessarily unjustified) and doesn't reciprocate his feelings. After Cheong San gets bit we see a tiny spark of what maybe could've been, but does she actually have romantic feelings for him or is it just guilt? We never really see any indication that she loves him in any way other than just a best friend. She never learns what 'left' meant. It's all just kind of awkward and underdeveloped when a few small changes could've made it a much more interesting and emotional relationship dynamic.

This drama would've benefited from dropping about 10 characters, developing the ones left over better and pulling in the plot tighter. The potential was all there (which is what made the viewing experience so frustrating). The side plots were so much more interesting and compelling than the main group's most of the time (I've already praised the cop duo but I also thought the group headed by Ha Ri and Mi Jin was so much more interesting and defined and I wish we'd followed them instead). The pacing was off (how could things drag but also feel so glossed over? how much time exactly had even passed since the outbreak started?) and so much time was wasted on things that served no purpose to the story. And then, just when I'm finally on the last ten minutes of this struggle of a show, they introduce a new plot that is actually interesting and fresh (a congregation of a new breed of zombie hybrids with superhuman abilities! lead by the most likable character with the most significant growth and development!) and that's where it ends.

And this is where my review will also end. Because I could go on, but I've covered more than enough. I've never felt compelled to write a review like this and there's definitely been some terrible shows I've watched. But the thing that sets this one apart is that it had so many ingredients to be a GREAT show. It could've really been an amazing, fresh twist on the zombie genre but it just dropped the ball over and over again. One or two pointless plots or underdeveloped characters would've been forgivable, but we were given the bones of a zombie drama without any meat.

Really good but really unrealistic
I mean what did I expect watching a movie about zombies, of course it will be unrealistic!

I found it weird how well the teenagers fought, no teenager is that good at fighting in real life.
Anyways, besides that it was a great show! I loved how they showed different faces of people, what they would do to survive and if they would sacrifice themselves.
It was frustrating though .
To be honest it was slightly overhyped, but I honestly loved it.
it did remind me of Tokyo Ghoul sometimes, with the hambies and stuff.
I was so mad when all my fav characters died fr and almost threw up seeing the zombie mutations and stuff

Why would I re-watch 'All of us are dead'?
Hello! This is my first ever review so please bear with me if it goes here and there at times. I have finished this drama within 2 days of its' release. Honestly, enjoyed watching it so much. There are a few obvious plot holes (come on writers ain't super humas to not have any) but while we watch the series they go unnoticed. I absolutely loved the emotions carried by the cast. The series had me sitting on the edge. The series COULD have been concluded in lesser episodes, at times it kinda feels dragged or maybe slowed down. But again, while watching it won't feel tiring at all.

So, the main question as why I would re-watch it? The BG score was so subtle, at times you just get into the scene and the score won't feel like an extra addition that was forced. This kind of stands out. I watched the trailer after finishing the series and then noticed how well they have composed it. Especially the whistle version of Auld Lang Syne which was by Cheong-San in the series was nicely put towards the outro of the trailer making it extra heavy. That song means farewell indeed. The series had my most favourite characters dying from episode to episode, and I really have complaints against it. My heart sank so much I would re watch it just to see those characters live and laugh on screen once more.

With zombies coming from everywhere right from the first minute, this series kept me hanging on to it even after 5 days of finishing it. I would definitely recommend you to watch it, at least to appreciate the production.

I understand I just had too many thoughts and no proper structure in my review. I promise to get better while I review further. Thanks if you read me till here.

Us All are Dead
Simply there is no plot development, for some unknown reason director choose to make same scenarios over and over through the series. The Sub plot of bullying or teen pregnancy or sexual harassment didn't make any impact on the story line. With nothing much in story, 12 episodes is very long, 8 episodes should have done good. My Big Complain is Writer and Director failed to imagine possibilities of story development. There where so many opportunities where story could have thickened but they choose not to.

My recommendation to people who want to watch, watch only if you have nothing else to watch, even so it in installments, do not worth the binge watch.

A lot of questionable decisions and things that don't make sense
The things I hated :

The characters are probably the worst part of the drama. A lot of of them were either boring, dumb, unnecessary, annoying or whatever. There were just too many and some of them only existed to make the story longer such as the assembly woman, the blogger, the pregnant teen etc. A lot of the story arcs were also poorly done. I thought Eunji was gonna have some sort of hero arc or at least fight off Gwi Nam to redeem herself since they're both half zombies but NOPE. They also made Nayeon seem remorseful for what she did for 5 minutes and then proceed to kill her like WHY???

One of my complaints is with the FL. On Ju is an incredibly boring, dull and uninteresting character. She's also extremely stupid at times. When the zombies were coming at her in the canteen, what does she do you ask? SHE FREAKING SAT THERE AND WAITED FOR CHEONG SAN TO SAVE HER. When she found out her best friend and crush died, what does she say to her Cheong San aka her childhood friend? THAT EVERYONE SHE LIKES DIED. She also almost cause Cheong San to die in the same scene. If it weren't for him saving her, she would have died. BE MORE GRATEFUL FOR GODS SAKE. No to mention her constantly beating and kicking Cheong San in the first couple of episodes. I really don't know what Cheong San see in her.

The romance between Su Hyeok and Nam Ra was super unnecessary and boring if you ask me. Nam Ra also makes some stupid decisions even though she's suppose to be the smart one. She saw Nayeon wanting to murder Gyeong Su and what does she do? SHE FREAKING WAITS UNTIL NAYEON DID IT TO ONLY EXPOSE HER. Why couldn't you have done it sooner and prevent 3 death??? Also, when she heard there was zombies coming why did she have to count how many there were ??? How is that in any way shape or form helpful?? JUST RUN ALREADY.

Cheong San's mom who was literally dumb as hell, not to mention his dad who just magically disappeared??? The police force my goodness, y'all let a bunch of high schoolers beat you ass at survival. The science teacher, who told the police to retrieve the his computer from the school science lab to find a cure but only...THERE WAS NO CURE IN THE FIRST PLACE. Eunji who ""set the school on fire"" when she just sat a bunch of papers IN ONE ROOM ON FIRE.

On Jo's dad also had an unnecessary sacrifice, he could have escaped safely with the group but no, they had to kill him. They also didn't bother to explain how hybrids seem to work, how and why 3 of them are different which left me confuse. After almost 3 days without food except for a piece of chocolate bar, you'd think they'd be tired and exhausted but NOPE they still seem perfectly intact.

The female characters in the classroom group were all so useless. When they encountered zombies, the male characters literally ripped out doors and windows from the classroom to attack and defend. And what do the female characters do? THEY LITERALLY STOOD THERE DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. They didn't build up I-Sak and On Ju's friendship except for a couple of flashbacks so I felt nothing when she died.

The times taken for each character to turn into zombies also didn't make sense. It took the science teacher's son a couple of weeks (?) to turn into zombies. Then when the school got infected, it was 5 seconds. When I-Sak was infected, it was 20 minutes. And when Gyeong Su is infected, it took him like what? A couple hours??

The things I liked :

The bromance between Su Hyeok and Cheong San were amazing. The scene where they were hanging off each other on the window was so cute, really wished there was more moments like that. The cinematography and camerawork was great, the canteen scene when students started getting infected was the most notable one. How they escaped from one room after another was quite interesting as well even though it got a little repetitive, I still liked it for the most part.

MINJI, her existence just makes me happy.

The acting was quite impressive, even though they were given quite shitty characters, they actors and actresses still did a pretty good job portraying them. My favourite portrayal would be Lee Yoo Mi who played Nayeon and Yoo In Soo who played Gwi Nam.

Would I rewatch it? Most definitely as I love to rewatch shows after a while. It was overall okay, I did enjoy it at some part. Not as good as Kingdom or Train to Busan but still not the worst thing in the world.

Netflix Sensationalism With Poor Substance
To quote a great poet ""I expected nothing and I'm still let down"".

I checked All of Us Are Dead out of curiosity: labelled as a Netflix show but with a kdrama more usual format (12 episodes of roughly 1h). I think this is the first time I wished this drama had been shorter like the other Netflix productions.

The Story

It drags on. The main plot of the students can be summarized in one sentence : a dozen students try to survive a zombie epidemic, moving from safe spots to safe spots while having encounters with zombies and see their group thin out. That's....... basically all there is to that main storyline. As the epidemic spreads, we follow for a while other storylines, notably two : that of Captain Song Jae Ik (Lee Kyu Hyung) and firefighter Nam So Ju (one of the female leads' father). While the first brought a well-needed comic relief and some adorable moments of Lee Kyu Hyung adopting kids left and right (and being his usual great self), the other managed to catch my attention more, balanced action scenes with calmer ones better than the school storyline. Maybe I was more receptive to these two particular part of the story because I like the actors involved or it moved quicker than the students' and gave more information to the stakes of the storyline. But, in my opinion, the part outside of the school were just..... better. Which is quite sad considering the main point of focus of the drama is youth in the midst of a zombie epidemic and the emotional impact such epidemic has on them.

In addition, I was really uncomfortable by the scene of sexual assault at the start of the drama which........ Served no purpose and was never really resolved unless punishing and blaming the victim even further was the point.

And generally speaking I'm just very tired of bullying plotlines. This is an important topic that should be addressed but lately it seems it's in every drama I watch and there is only so much I can take.

The drama could have easily been just 10 episodes or even less, but instead we got long boring scenes of the students talking and talking and talking and being suspicious and fighting (plus some plotholes) not to mention two ""love"" storylines that were quite honestly kinda cute but unnecessary imo.


The Characters

Going in pairs with my boredom to the students storyline, I did not really get attach to any of the students. I liked them, the actors did a good job portraying them but they were..... Just there. I did not particularly care what would happen to them and even if some scenes were sad I barely felt anything. It just did not click for me. HOWEVER, once again, Lee Kyu Hyung portraying a police captain trying to grapple with the last shred of hope he can find and Jeon Bae Soo in a desperate father role were two highlights and I was disappointed when their arcs were done (especially Lee Kyu Hyung's which was cut way to short for my taste).

Visuals

The zombies make-up and their choreography was really well done (one of the few positives in this drama for me). They truly looked the part and were chilling at times.

As for the rest... I know this is a horror drama and that gory scenes are likely to happen. But this drama really had me think that some gore scenes were simply there just because Netflix can have them - in a ""in-your-face"" kind of way. Just like with most of their dramas, it seems to me they massively take the route of violent, gritty dramas and just go and escalate what they show each time. I'm not sure why. Is it provocation? Is it cheap shock-value? Is it just to ""buzz"" on social medias and thus receive extra publicity? I'm not sure, but this Netflix Sensationalism is not IT. And it's frustrating because Netflix knows just how to make shows with violence and still have it be a natural part of the story (Kingdom comes to mind particularly) and not...... the whole personnality of the drama.

The cinematography was subpar at best, not that I was expecting anything in that regard.


In conclusion

If you like zombies and have seen several dramas and movies on the subject, you will probably get bored though you might still want to check it out. If this is one of your first dramas, please check out other dramas. If it's zombies you're interested about, Kingdom is right there waiting for you. If it's simply dramas in general, Netflix and many other platforms like Viki, Viu and others have many titles to offer with better stories, better development, better crafting all around.

Zombie Zombie.
I am usually not a fan of Zombie movie but I got curious how they will manage to follow Train to Busan and Peninsula. I thought overall it was a nice drama. The story lack some point or could have been better developped. As for the bully girl, she is here to show that bullied can become bully. I would have loved to see her in a massive fight with Gyu Nam but I can understand the writer point of view. In this drama, the adult are completely useless and it shows that the teenager do not need help. I was sure that not all of the kids will make it as it is korean and no... Not everyone will survive a zombie apocalypse. I am really confused as why Nam Ra is still alive and didn't decided to sacrifice herself in order to protect the other but I guess we might have an answer in the 2nd season. The adult are quite famois actor for people who do know kdrama. As for the kids it depends but I was so happy to see Park Solomon and Yoon Chan Young on a lead role for netflix and I hope it.will bring them more opportunities. Overall, as we were going forward the drama... I had that weird feeling and it somehow got confirm at the end of ep 12. ""You abandoned us"" "" I won't ever trust an adult"". It was a shout out to all the adult that gave up on the teenagers stuck in the sewol ferry that the adult didn't try to save. After watching Birthday with Yoon Chan Young a few years back... I never thought they will reuse similar scene as an interrogation of the survivor like it was their fault. I feel like I wouldhave to watch it again to catch all the secondary point but I will be really excited to see the season 2

A Unique Show With A Zombie Origin
I loved that this show has the zombie origin and has lots of twists that are new to zombie shows. It has a lot of originality and not your typical zombie show. Plus it adds real human emotions which is really possible during a zombie outbreak.

I also like that the casts acted really well, with the guidance from their director. And watching the behind the scenes, they had fun shooting even if it takes a lot of time and preparation to shoot a single scene. I like that the storytelling was good, and the camera shots are meticulously done. It's not dizzying or confusing to watch even with the chaos brought about by running or fighting from zombies

All of Us are Dead builds on and extrapolates the zombie playing field of Train of Busan, and more
If you have enjoyed Train to Busan, you will be drawn in gradually to this series. All of Us are Dead builds on and extrapolates the zombie playing field of Train of Busan, from a 2h movie to a 12h drama series, and from within a train to a sprawling high school campus.

As i am still pretty new to kdramas and not familiar with the k actors/actresses, It was confusing for me with the introduction of many different students all dressed in the same school uniforms in the first episode, albeit the occasional different coloured sweaters for some students. After 4 episodes, i started to wonder how the series can continue meaningfully for another 8 episodes, other than students trying to escape alive from the zombie-flooded school.

The series surprisingly engages as it starts to develop the key characters, connecting viewers to them, and exploring humanity, love, sacrifices and teamwork between peers, teacher-students, dad-family, amidst the relentless attacks by the endless swarms of zombies. See comment for link to life lessons and spoilers. It drags at midpoint, as with most dramas. The introduction of half zombies thereafter beefed up the plot for a 12h series.

Overall, it is an enjoyable and enriching zombie series to watch. While i wont be rewatching this series, I do look forward to Season 2 of this series.

Pretty good but a bit drawn out.
** All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who've managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse.
** With 12 episodes running 1 hr. long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence. It could easily have been done in 8 episodes.
** Some of the characters were a little annoying and the romantic interests felt just a bit silly and somewhat ill fitting.

*** Aside from that it was otherwise reasonably entertaining.

It may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.

different but annoyingly different
just like sweet home and squid game, this was unlike the ""usual"" kdramas, well the zombie apocalypse part, the highschool romance angst was actually exactly like any other school kdramas ;)

for a zombie apocalypse, it's not usually from a teens' pov. and usually it doesn't revolve around bullying.. but that was it's charm..
was it believable? lol of course not.. those kids never ate anything for 3 days straight, and they barely slept, yet they had enough strength to run, fight and hold back zombies who are known for their speed and power (like those chombies showcased, there's no way those kids could've survived that long)


Tbh prez should use her strength more, I mean if it was a guy chombie he'd have carried them all out and saved the day by now.. prez only threw bully off the roof once..

that bullied girl eating bullied boy.. that's not revenge, he couldn't protect himself she shouldn't have expected him to save her.. she needed to take revenge on her bully.. she should've stayed in the school then found her bully bullying the kids so she'd save them and have her revenge
her revenge against ""the whole school"" made no sense cuz as those kids showed most of them didn't know either of the bullies or the bullied..

also with cheong san's mom, he should've shown more disbelief, and also she shouldn't have gone there, also where was his dad?
it's like the mom, the fls dad, the bully, the bullied girl, they were all just steps to get the story somewhere.. but they just mostly needed less eps and less reason to drag it out, like that whole flashbacks sequences..

Cheong San didn't deserve this.. the bully was attacking him and he defended himself.. he did not deserve an eye for an eye


The 2 cops are just adopting any kid they find?? I was waiting for them to run away with 1 kid now they have 2???

Mindless fun
Hello, first of all I want to apologize for any grammatical mistake in the review English isn't my first language and I never took specialized classes to learn it at a somewhat professional level, with that out of the way I 'am kind of new to K-dramas I only started watching them when covid began so please be gentle with me (／≧ω＼).

Story: (6-7/10)

without going into too much details I'll try to stay as vague as I can, there is not a lot going on story wise at least not the first half of the show it's basically as the synopsis says students try to survive a zombie outbreak the first 6 episodes are very slow in my opinion but by the end they did a great job building this sense of urgency and uncertainty it definitely has some common clichés but it should be expected as this is a Drama after all. One more gripe that I have with the show is the lack of development in characters luckily the acting is very good so it's not that big of a deal. Overall the story for what is there is decent nothing groundbreaking but it will keep you entertained.

Acting: (8/10)

This is where the show excels the most, I had never heard of Yoon Chan Young, Park Solomon, Park Ji Hoo and Jo Yi Hyun but they all performed great the supporting cast was one of the best I've seen in a while they do a great job making you relate to the characters and root for them (the zombies were very scary and well played too)

Music: (5-6/10)

Nothing special here I don't even remember one song from the score it does the job and builds the scenes correctly.

Rewatch value (6/10)
I 'am very biased here I usually don't rewatch shows unless I was very touched by it and in this case while the show is good it's nothing spectacular I don't see why someone would rewatch unless a season 2 is announced in a few years

Overall (8/10)
While the show is nothing special if you are like me and like horror, gore and apocalyptic settings this show is good fun, if you are looking for something with a deep story and meaningful interactions this is not what you are looking for.

A little hokey but still entertaining
First of all, I wanted to address something several reviews I've read have mentioned about the story. The thing to keep in mind as you're watching is, primarily, All Of Us Are Dead is focusing on a group of TEENAGERS trying to survive a zombie apocalypse with no help. Those of us that are adults, think back to when you were a teenager? Did you make intelligent, rational decisions? I was considered an intelligent kid and I know I didn't. And that's not with the added stress of a real life-or-death scenario. So I think a little grace needs to be used when nitpicking the decisions that led to undesirable results for these kids.

That said, I will agree that while I commend what they were TRYING to do story-wise (commentary about school bullying, the toxicity of politics, etc), there was definitely too much going on that didn't need the screen time and sort of took away focus from what should have been the main theme. I understand wanting to show the end of innocence and childhood through the loss of a parent too soon but the pregnant student and the subsequent baby left without its mother part seemed redundant, especially when there was so much emphasis put on a couple of the students witnessing the death of a parent or at least knowing for sure that their parents were dead.

The focus on the assembly member after On-jo's father had left the group to find his daughter didn't really seem needed to me at all. And killing him off within minutes after they were reunited seemed like just a cheap way to keep the kids on their own with no adult help whatsoever and made all the screen time focused on him being a badass and trying to get to the school and all his setbacks completely worthless.

Personally, I felt like not enough time was spent on fleshing out the characters and their relationships to each other to make the deaths more meaningful and devastating. Don't get me wrong, it's sad and a couple of them made me shed a tear even (I'm pretty emotional though and tend to cry when I see others crying.) but it never lasted very long.

The only other thing about it that irks me is that the score was completely forgettable. To the point where I don't remember any of it minus the intro music. I feel like with the use of a better score, I would have felt a lot more connected to the story and characters like I did after the rooftop singing scene.

Despite all that, I still found it incredibly entertaining and I'm interested in what they might be planning for a possible second season.

TLDR; Not the best drama ever written, but not the worst either. In my eyes, worth a watch if you're into zombies and horror.

Watch it right now
My first time writing a review, and you gotta watch this drama if you are hesitating to watch it. I watched this with my friends as soon as this came and it was a great. Watching this with family and friends would make it 100 times fun. But I really enjoyed this drama because the story was not too predictable and the acting was great. And am really happy for the actors that they are finally getting recognize. Woooo rooting for Solomon upcoming projects. ( this drama definitely made me a Solomon Stan) ??

It took me some time to decide if i should watch this drama or not, because it doesn't fit in my usual category of shows i watch. After considering it, i said to myself ""just try, get out of your confort zone. If you don't like it, just drop it!"". I Finally decided to watch it. After the first episode i was not sure if i was able to continue to watch, because some scenes were to violent for me. I kept going, in order to give a full opportunity to this drama and because i don't like to drop.

I made it, i watched it all in two days and i do not regret it (and actually i'm kind of proud of myself for watching it all). This Drama is really good, well made. I'm not a person who usually likes and watch horror things, but i watched it and liked it (i had to cover my eyes sometimes, i'm too easily scared ahah). I actually liked the ending, even though i was a bit sad about some losses. I don't know if i'm gonna rewatch it, but i will definitely watch if a second season comes out.

I recommend it.

Modern day Zombie drama of Kingdom
I really like zombie movies created by KOREANs. It always giving me chills, getting up from my chair in some scenes. And this gives me excitement omgggg‼ some scenes I felt sad for they cannot do about their parents has been beaten . And the funny and irritating scenes is that one of the infected student have an UNLI life until they BOMB the HYOSAN area that has been affected with infected people. Somehow I felt pity for those parents, friends and even the irritating batchmates they have. I thought the general who was in charge of the misssion is brave enough, but at the end he did suicide for what he did... Congrats ‼??? to Kdrama Series for making at the TOP again in NETFLIX after Squid Game. Which is talk of the Town again and doing some memes on facebook and twitter.?

It's a normal day at Hyosan High School. At least it looked like it: you learn together, exchange the latest gossip. In between, weaker people are also humiliated who cannot or do not want to defend themselves against the school bullies. But abusive students and nasty students are soon the least of the problems for the young people. More and more people suddenly start behaving strangely, becoming aggressive and biting anyone who doesn't get away fast enough. As chaos erupts around them and everyone turns into zombies, groups including On-jo (Ji-hoo Park), Cheong-san (Chan-young Yoon), Su-hyeok (Solomon Park) and Nam-ra (Yi-hyun Cho) belongs to get out of the whole story alive. But that's anything but easy when the entire school grounds are overrun by zombies...
All of Us Are Dead takes place in a high school in South Korea that becomes the center of a zombie apocalypse. The setting is not new, nor is the content. Horror is crossed with teen drama and a bit of social criticism. But there are already a number of exciting scenes that make it worth watching the somewhat generously dimensioned series.

Very thrilling and reinvent old school zombie
It was really enjoyable after watching All of Us Are Dead (adapted from webtoon). This drama was giving me a vibe of old school zombie that I have not seen for many years since there are not many series or movies that has school zombie so far. This drama is enough decent for you to watch if you like to see zombies in school. All of Us Are Dead's production is quite amazing and it is almost enough to be equally to the Hollywood movies. On another hand, their acting skills are quite good and it is worth to enjoy their acting skills. I personally think it is really decent because all I see are zombies. There is not really make any huge difference in that drama. It's just an amazing production I see in that drama. In addition, I know the storyline is not completed because that drama may not release another season, but worth to eye on it!

Honestly, I think it is worth to watch if you really are interested in school zombies. Just go for it!

Karma is a btch
I have high expectations for this drama after watching its trailer that immediately captured my curiosity but still it is a high school-themed zombie series so that ended my expectations.

The production and its CGI effects are definitely not a cringe-worthy, you could really see the dedication in delivering a worth to be watched zombie kdrama in a Gen Z era so might as well list your survival tips.

Compared with other zombie kdramas, the story is too hopeless. Your survival depends on how you act, it must be good ofcourse. This drama could be a great example in taming ones' human nature in facing a human extinction like a zombie apocalypse. That one should think of the others rather than a selfish survival.

Nonetheless, it was good to be watched for a first round but would not go binge-watch again.

Beautiful story new korean zombie series Teenage version Hopefully with Season 2.
I like this new korean zombie series the story is good but I'm wondering why cheongsan died I know he was second in the main role, and one of the things I liked was that they didn't just focus on the main roles, all the characters had big roles as well as the fire rescuer and the police and the girl sebin and the pregnant student and the bullies were one of the things that made the story better.and not only is he scary there are scenes that will make you cry especially the child who was bitten by his mother and also the mother of cheongsan and the mother of a female student with them one of the ones who made me cry and I don't really expect cheongsan to die because he is one of main roles so I finally dreamed but I understand sacrifice what he did for the majority. but overall the story is good I hope there is season 2.

Not rlly a review. I just want to share my brain juices. I mean, it kind of is a review. But don't take it to seriously.

I was really sad about finishing penthouse because I was trying to take forever to watch it so I could enjoy it some more, however I finally gave in and finished it. Then about 2 days later started watching All of us are dead.

Okay, so I never really bothered watching it when it first came out because I felt like it'd just be some basic zombie show. And at the time (compared to now after finishing penthouse) I wasn't really into all the blood #romancefreak. However, this has definitely expanded my drama needs to the point I will probably start searching for dramas like this. Before I was mainly only into romance (Because I am a hopeless romantic) however somehow, this show, that I finished in under 24 hours, has completely changed my view on everything for what might be forever.

I am seriously in love with Cheongsan that I might cry myself to sleep tonight. The show made me feel a mix of emotions that I cannot describe. From me gripping my chest at the intensity on a Tuesday night, to nearly crying my eyes out to the point I flooded my whole city.

Now personally about the cast, I would like to say they did an excellent job, maybe not as good as what I've seen before, however it was still empressive AND expressive. And ESPECIALLY the actor for Gwinam. I was on the floor shaking. But also, especially with the work of all the zombies. Even if some of it was CGI, (?) I can't imagine all the work it would take. Just imagine all the zombies walking around though. What I liked about the setting of the show is that it kind of made you feel like you were there. I don't know if that is just because sometimes I am very into a show to the point I imagine myself in the show, or if it is just because of the camera work and the use of long shots. For example the perspective of Nayeon when Cheongsan was in the room. And also when they decided to leave the rooftop, it made me want to be there, like experience it. I am a bit off a big horror fan, but I only really played horror GAMES not really watched horror movies other than classics like, i don't know, Annabelle...?

Even though she kind of barely didn't last, Nayeon was probably my favourite character, despite her wrong doings. But to be honest, it made her more likable. Because it kind of separated her from everyone. Like everyone was on one side, except for her. Which I just found interesting. When she died I was kind of upset. Before I started watching the show, I thought she'd be a half zombie, because I just for some reason thought she'd be one so when she died I was kind of upset, like.. I felt like I lied to myself for like 8 episodes. So I had a lot of reflecting. And I was kind of praying that she was just somehow alive in some way, but then when they were going to bomb everything that REALLY? HURT MY FEELINGS? BECAUSE I SAW MY GIRL NAYEON THERE.

Would I watch again? No. I am not putting myself through 12 hours of pain over and over again. Also my attention span is horrible, and near the end, when it wasn't suspenseful as the other episodes, I did kind of get bored and get distracted. To be fair I was speaking to my friend whilst watching it however it was just, not as entertaining as the other episodes.

Honestly I was sad for all the deaths that happened in this show. whether or not I hated them.

I just rlly liked this show

Strong Start
I did NOT expect to watch this drama. The first time I saw the trailer I was terrified and had no intentions of watching it but after my friends pushed me to watch it, I gave in. 15 MINUTES into the drama I was already hooked. The Show was AMAZINGGGG the first 5 episode it was just so addicting. But after that, I guess I could understand why the show was dragging because they had to extend the cast to the military too and less toward the students. I am satisfied by the ending because I thought most of the characters would die and only one would remain but a lot of the characters survived so I was happy about that but some important characters did die and that was really painful. This is a drama you would binge watch in a few days because if you extend it or drag it. It may become boring because this drama starts fast-paced like most netflix thriller dramas. I highly recommend for stress relief because your mind will only be worried about what will happen next in the drama rather than your outside world.

I wanted to rate this with a solid 7.5, because despite me not liking it very much, it was pretty well made. But after thinking about this series for two days and feeling like I wasted my time and I want that time back, I think I can no longer be objective. I HATE THIS. The characters are annoying, the gore is boring and too much, there is no character development, people just die for the shock value like it's common in those zombie apocalypses - but why should I care? The characters weren't likable or relatable to begin with. They gave some characters like the girl's father an important story arc just to end everything in such a pointless way.
So ... the filming is good, the acting is good too. I don't blame the actors for those lifeless characters. I'm pretty sure they were told to act like this. The older actors were pretty disappointing though. I expected more from them. The comment is a mess like my head after watching this pointless series. POINTLESS is the right word I guess.
NOT IMPRESSED.

If you want to start with Zombie apocalypse series you should try this one! ❤️
Well for me, the series is good and interesting. It's not that you'll get thrilled every second. At first I know the title itself will tell the story but it's so hard to believe that the main characters will die ( though it wasn't reveal if it's really true or maybe he is still alive and become 'hambie' ) it's so heartbreaking for me to see how this series end like that.

There are so many questions need to get answer. It's just the series has lack of creative plot unlike on movie World Ward Z, Train To Busan, Flu though most of them were almost a sad ending too but they have the best ending! They find the antidote and find the solutions that will guarantee a HAPPY ENDING for everyone. So I need Season 2 to get clarify on every single details.

What I'm talking about is the story is a typical zombie apocalypse where the character need to survive. But deep inside it will also tackle about the importance of friendships and family, that bullying is BAD! and the real problem of the society.

I really like this since the character is a students cause Im a student too, I can easily relate and adapt to the story, but don't expect this will be good as World war Z, and other popular zombie apocalypse movie, cause the ending still aches my heart million times😭! But I recommend this for everyone

To save the majority, just how heartless do you think you need to be?
Out of all the zombie movies/series I have watched, this has the most substance. It is way more than just the thrill. The messages conveyed in this movie can touch you in ways, you never expected. That's exactly the case for me. And I really love this series.

I have mentioned on most of my reviews on titles related to zombie that I am not really a fan of zombie stuff because most of the time, you know what's the most possible ending, everyone will die. So I am always looking for something that will catch my interest and sustain my attention until the end. All Of Us Are Dead did just that. Having the Ground Zero set at a school is something I haven't seen before. The reason/motivation on how it started is also unique than most vague movies wherein it just started somehow without definite explanation. Every deaths on this movie made me feel various emotions from being melancholic to feeling 'he/she deserve it.' It was more than just becoming zombies. I love how the story focuses on the characters who wanted to survive, how they lost their love ones, how they lost each other, how they rely on each other, how the situation made them grow. The pain, the sadness, the happiness. It delivers a spectrum of emotions I never imagined on a zombie show. There were also parts that are actually light and fun that somehow lightens the mood of the whole series.

Great selection of casts really. The way they deliver their individual characters made the story much more believable and colorful. Most of the times shows that has a lot of characters ended up just blending in together however on this one, all the characters was able to make themselves shine in their own ways. It really felt like a group of students who are friends that has common and also individual identity that separates them from the others.

Honestly, although it left me with a lot of questions and imaginations, I love that the ending was open-ended. It kind of makes me hope that Season 2 is possible. If another season is given for this show, I'll definitely re-watch it. I have enjoyed every single scene of the show and would definitely love to re-live the moments with the casts again.

I'm always saying that I can't watch horror
but I keep finding more and more stuff that
fit that genre. ? This drama appeared in the
top ten in my country on Netflix so I gave it a
try. And overall I was pretty much satisfied.

Although the twelve episodes seemed a little
bit too much (I think that eight or ten would
be sufficient to tell the story), the drama
didn't have bland or dull moments and was
moving steadfast. The groups of characters
were interesting, my favourite would be the
main group, or the one with the archer girl,
she was amazing. ? I also liked the
policeman, who was trying to save everyone.
On the other hand I absolutely hated Gwi
Nam and I can't from how much he was able
to survive, like all that fallings and such. ?

Overall I rate All of Us Are Dead 8/10,
enjoyable but it was missing something.

Actually not bad for Netflix zombie Webtoon series!
So I decided to give the live action a go because I saw it’s No 4 in Ireland on Netflix right now and I found out that it is based off a Webtoon. Yeah it’s not a great art so definitely this was the better version personally! I may not be a fan of zombie themed stuff because they are always obvious and you know wtf was going to happen. I mean, this series isn’t any different from every zombie flick out there but at least it puts some twists and turns to make you interested. I honestly was interested with how the character Na-ra was able to look less zombish and able to jump from the roof like a ninja?! Yeah I am assuming that cliffhanger would be left to s2 or just giving us poor audience a tease to make out what really happened in our heads. Even if the ending was pretty much a very questionable one, the characters, the music and the storyline in a way were entertaining enough. Yes it is clique in some parts with,using recycled horror tropes but again, I really enjoyed it and glad I didn’t bother with the Webtoon…

Not your basic GORE FEST
Overall, this drama is amazing! After Train to Busan, the zombie-gore genre has been hyped in the south Korean entertainment. Reaching the benchmark of amazingly produced TTB, 'ALL OF US DEAD' was an even better in terms of cinematography and production value. The makeup and graphics were on point. At some point, the intensity of the graphics were so high that i covered my eyes even if I am a huge fan of gore.

But is it just the gore? No!!
The strong message of humanity was what touched me. Bullying and torment in such extreme level does actually prevails and it shows how it affects an individual. Parenthood is depicted in a beautiful way as well.
""No parent would want their child to die right?""
On-jo's dad sacrificed himself to save his daughter, Cheongsan's mom came running for her son and the school girl who just delivered her baby, tied herself up to keep her baby safe. It shows that the professor who created the virus was lead by his love for his child.

It also shows how every character is not-so-humane and depicts the character flaw. But, the horryfying thing is it didn't had any likeable character at all. The plot has its focus on each character so we can see only part of each. My favorite character has to be the teacher and the detective!

Overall, great experience. Completed in one sitting and not boring at all! The cliffhangers does its job and where do I even get started about the intro? It's by far one of the best intro i've ever seen. I loved it.

Unexpected story
I usually enjoy the zombie genre and All of Us Are Dead was no exception. The plot progression was good and the musical score helped to improve the intense moments in each episode. There was some well-timed humour that was unexpected but helped cut some of the seriousness of the scenes.

However, the characters quickly became overbearing. The constant theme of ""sacrifice"" showed how immature the characters were. The slow reaction to life-threatening situations was frustrating and the fact that no zombies reached them in the time they were there wasting standing around was unrealistic. I had a great time binging but apart from Su-Hyeok, Na-Ra and Ha-ri, I can't say there was a single character who I consistently rooted for.

If you like gore more than story then this is for you
Just finished the drama and have so much to say, finally we got a zombie show set in modern day after train to busan. It was long overdue and I just believe korea makes the best zombie content like there's no argument there. I liked that the shows backdrop was bullying like highlighting such an serious issue with zombies somehow worked. It also showed even though there are main actors, there's no bias between each character you never know what's going to happen next and that kept me on the edge of my seat.

The visual effects, makeup and acting in terms of being zombies was outstanding. I feel like the actors especially Yoon Chan Young also did a great job in displaying emotion and pain, it had me crying many times. But like people are saying some characters were just not developed enough and i agree. I wish we got more backstory than just them fighting zombies. I also liked that they showed us how the virus was resolved, otherwises most zombies shows or sci fi shows end on the main leads still fighting zombies and trying to survive. Also appreciate that they got young actors to play high school students, you can tell and it does make an difference.

That being said I know the show is getting a of cristimism in terms of its rabbit holes, but I think they still just an great job in creating an decent show within 12 episodes, could there be changes yes for sure, but i think they mainly wanted to make it an zombie show than a show filled with story and in terms of that boy did they deliver or what.

Watched it all in less than 24 hours.
Nowadays it takes a lot for me to get into a show. Whether it be a show in English or a kdrama. My attention span is not that great so if it doesn’t draw me in within the first 30 minutes or so, I usually don’t stick around. But, as you can tell from the headline, I was REALLY into this one. I had been seeing so many ppl on twitter talk about it but I didn’t think much of it. But then yesterday I was bored and decided to give it a try. I was up until 1am trying to finish the show. The story, the acting, the characters had me all HOOKED. So much happened so fast that I felt like I had lived a whole lifetime by the 3rd episode. This drama definitely deserves all of the hype it’s getting in twitter. Now, ofc there were some things that I didn’t like but that’s literally every show.

I highly recommend you check this show out. I promise you won’t be able to predict what happens next bc there’s a twist every few minutes. I can’t wait until season 2!

Watch it! Its awesome
Not everyone likes this type of drama. But if you will give it a try then definitely it will keep you busy watching it. This drama is rollercoaster of emotions. It will make you cry, it will make you angry, it will make you laugh and many more. And i definitely enjoyed this rollercoaster ride. The acting of cast was top notch. They represented every emotion clearly. Believe me i have cried almost in every episode. The acting of people who became zombie was like Oh my god. Its not easy to act like zombie. You will know it if you will watch it.zombie dramas has their own fan base. My favorite thing about this drama was their friendship of cast in drama. Like how they always stayed together and moved forward with each other. They believed in each other and trusted each other.

This is a great drama about friendship and sacrifices. When you will think like this will happen next no this drama doesn't goes on as per your imagination. It fooled me every time. If you are a emotional drama fan. Then this is for you. You will cry your heart out. In some scenes you will get goosebumps. A drama about how can minorities can fight back or else let themselves involve in majority. This drama also deals with problem of mental health. This drama plays with your emotions and mind. And you will let drama play with your mind and emotions.

I really loved this drama. Its Awesome. This drama definitely deserves more ratings. The acting of actors, the zombies, the emotions , the sacrifices and main the friendship was next level. Its best zombie drama i have watched so far. I dont know if you will like it or not but its definitely a outstanding drama. I think i will not get over this drama for like 10 days. Binge it. Its an awesome outstanding and i have no words for it drama

You will watch it for the hype, but is it worthy?
Coming from 2016 Train to Busan and its 2020 sequel Peninsula, 2018 Rampant, 2019 Kingdom, and 2020 Alive, K-Zombie variety undeniably is a top-tier. Molding a story that synthesizes actuality and thrill, K-Zombie films and series are definitely no-skip.

All of Us Are Dead gives you a notion of being trapped in your school amidst an apocalypse and that's it, we are, once again, to take the same route of emotions, human nature, and morale.

In this perspective, multiple altitudes of development and headway await in its potential, but you will end up looking for the main course.

This is what the show offers: nothing is drawn for one purpose, each connects, each counts, each is just a part of a whole another madness.

Its 12-hour sail provides crammed and lengthy subplots, but amazingly delivers a visual harmony and topnotch performances by the actors.

Imagine a teen-oriented popular afternoon show, but there are zombies in it; this is what All of Us Are Dead brings to the flourishing violent and gore, but socially aware and genuine category of Korean Dramas.

Simply Brilliant!
This is a phenomenal series. Sure, it is graphic, raw, and are not afraid to show lead actors/actresses dying. It is a brilliant zombie series that is creative, contemporary, and full of human emotions. The action is fast-paced and full of surprises. I know there are only so many directions you can take a zombie series but this one took new paths. How? By actually making us care both for the humans and zombies. It also gave them a human soul despite them being more dead than alive. I also love the twist between humans and zombies. I thought that was so creative and even scarier than a pure zombie apocalypse. There is a lot of superb acting in this series and some awesome physical prowess by many of the actors and actresses.

A zombie show with an interesting premise, but becomes frustrating to watch gradually.
The show definitely had me the first episode. It has an interesting origins for the zombie virus, and they show you how it starts and how it affects the city throughout each episode. There are different characters, and you see their story and their reasons for doing what they do. There are some characters will you root for. Characters with strong survival skills and logical thinking, and they are similar to Daryl and Michonne from The Walking Dead if you've ever seen it. That's the good I have to say about the show.

As for the bad, this show becomes increasingly frustrating to watch. You're going to wonder why certain characters do idiotic things or wait for bad things to happen. Some characters you expect to fulfill their roles later on. One student is big and strong, he carries a door and uses it to hold off some zombies. In a later episode, I expected him to help bust down a door, but instead they had some of the weaker students try to do it. Logically, it makes no sense. Its very irritating to watch.

Speaking of irritating, one of the main antagonists will not go down. There are plenty of chances for him to die, yet because of the virus (aka ""plot armor"") he just constantly gets back up and gets to do whatever he wants. I get that he's a villain, but as someone who loves well written villains, he needs more. Most characters get flashbacks and a backstory, this one guy does not. If the writers had made him a more relatable, maybe he wouldn't be so annoying. But he's just evil for the sake of being evil.

I understand these are just teenagers, so that may give reasoning for their dumb decision making. However, they make several references to zombie films and are aware of what zombies are. I would think that if they know about zombies, they would know more about how zombies are and how to kill them. But you're not gonna see that for a while, until way later in the series.

All of us are Dead did hook me with the first few episodes, but then it started testing my patience. I really wish they didn't make it so obnoxious to watch in later episodes, and I don't plan on re-watching it again.

all of us are dead :x
as an avid zombie/apocalyptic series watcher, i shall give an objective review on this series..

STORY
i think the story as much potential, tho i wont say it has been fully optimized or put to good development in this series? also not comparing to the webtoon since i had not read it. the typical circle for apocalyptic series are simple: outbreak, seeing the human nature (some are selfess, some evil), definitely some exceptions where they have immunity/ half-mutant and of course sacrifices... The story did touch on these, but i felt it could have been done maybe a little more in depth.

so my opinions is:
1. ground zero: i like that in this show, they did explain the source of ground zero. in many series, we do not actually have a reason or clue why there's an outbreak (e.g sweet home, train to busan) . they key was of course a genius scientist, whom in a desperate attempt to save his suicidal kid, developed some sort of drug? that makes you half dead, half alive, hence zombies. so this is what i like because it's quite a wholesome explanation
2. human nature: and of course, in every zombie/apocalyptic series, there's gonna be selfless people and also ppl who annoy the hell out of you. so of course, the star players will be the main troop: cheongsan & suhyeok + i would say mijin & hari because i love that girl crush duo. annoying ones of course: gwi nam, nayeon and jimin?? sorry it was also borderline onjo for me tho her character was okay because she did provided survival guidance as a fireman's daughter?? just felt that she waskinda harsh to cheongsan at times ...
3: mutants: seriously this was the part i felt that most imagination or development can be put to use? main 3 mutants : eunji, gwi nam & namra.
- first, i get that they are highlighting the bullying culture in SK, hence eunji's character? but other than that , she was kinda useless for me tho? and to me kinda unneccessay since she never met up with the main squad at all? it could have been better if she had used her new found life to help the squad and also revenge on gwi nam? i mean that was the direction i had in mind the moment i realize she was mutant? but the writer didnt made her do that so i dont really know the point of her character?
- gwinam, of course there's gonna be a villian out there and it's safe to say gwinam is one of the main villian? like he is so dead bound on killing cheongsan just because he witness him murdering the principal? to me that quite illogical...? and right it might be cheongsan's character but idk why he had to keep provoking gwinam when really his life and death is at stake?? and for me, him having evidence of gwinam killing the principal? but so what? was it really that important when you dont even know you can survive tomorrow? i mean it's a good arc to have to introduce a villian, but i did not find the reason convincing enough .........
- namra, the only mutant in the squad but wasted potential? like it's obvious she has half human half zombies senses, and was of course helpful towards the crew, but she has more potential of course out of her character? but it did not happen? i mean with her abilities, she could have been better used to help the members, or even attract others of her kinds and eventually be a subject for clinicals to develop a cure at the later stage?? but i realize there were mnay scenes where she really just stood and watch ... so it felt like a waste to me though i really like her character?
4. sacrifices: too much in this series, but acceptable for a survival series. main sacrifices: joonyeong, cheongsan. the rest which i felt was unneccessay was : onjo's dad, woojin
- like joonyeong really selfless outthere protecting mijin when minutes ago he was just quarrelling with her? but he did not hesitate to save her and got himself infected in the end. he then ultimately sacrifices himself to draw the zombies away from his friends for their escape...
- same goes for cheongsan like he kinda like the main hero in the series :( honestly felt his death (??) was not neccessary if they had more useful development for some characters out there :( i am not sure how the webtoon ended but i hope he manages to escape as a half mutant like namra (though unlikely given the explosion, and gwi nam injuring his eyes like wtf). if only there was eunji revenge arc/ namra putting his abilities to better use/ introduction of new mutants to the squad in between...
-onjo's dad: honestly i was expecting more from his escapee, or at least hoping he has an encounter with jaeik and the lackey ?? to form a better crackdown team because the militants have their own dilema in saving those kids i get it. and his sacrifice...wasn't really needed i feel...they should have included him in the squad for a longer time frame :(
- woojin; really love it out there when he saved the other girl, and in the end hari ...it was touching but i actually hoped he had survived..

regarding the loveline: it felt like namra and suhyeok was the main, although it might have been onjo and cheongsan. i wish they hadn't included it at all because it wasnt clearly explained or developed enough? like cheongsan and onjo's loveline was clear, because they grew up together.. but namra and suhyeok suddenly? idk... and also suhyeok didnt make it clear to onjo at the end as well too since she confessed to him? and at the back it seems like onjo likes cheongsan? it's kinda messy for me. basically could have be simple, like cheongsan likes onjo, onjo likes suhyeok (not sure why tho, should have had some flashbacks) but later realizes she likes cheongsan. Suhyeok making his feelings clear to both onjo & cheongsan, and also show some flashback how did him and namra ended up liking e/o?) hmmm..

ACTING:
overall, most of the actors and actresses were new faces to me. but i didnt feel any awkward acting so far... probably some characters were not written well enough? but i personally really loved badass characters like hari & mijin? and also namra tho she could have been written for better use i feel... and of course, cheongsan and suhyeok was great there!!

MUSIC/REWATCH
not much music but since i wasn't distracted by any music, i think it was well directed? hmm probably wont rewatch, but i do hope they sign for a S2/3 because the ending doesnt seem simple? because namra is basically alive, mutated with the rest that is like them? and we of course need a key personnel to put them into good use, developing a vaccine or antibodies (like in happiness) so they can return to human form ? and i hope cheongsan is alive somehow... :|

overall, i think it was a good watch tho i felt the series shouild have been an 8 - 10 episodes long if they removed unnecessary characters or plots that did not contribute to the flow of the show... i will just wait for some news if there's a new seaon, like Sweet Home :D

Second leads carry the entire plot
I said that Kingdom and Happiness are the best zombie drama. I will say All of Us Are Dead is the best zombie drama too but in a school drama genre.

Additional WARNING that Netflix doesn't tell you:
- It contains sexual graphics (a naked girl shot from behind) in one of the episodes.
I think I should write this in case you are looking for information about whether it's safe to watch it with family <3

Pros:
- Cho Yi Hyun is badass af. She carried the whole drama. Been a fan since she's in Hospital Playlist <3
- School-themed drama. So, the origin of the zombies can seamlessly be explained with scientific theories.
- Creative conflict problem solutions that the watchers don't expect
- Good amount of teen romance stuff
- Not too much comedy but it naturally is there.
- Pretty solid plot. Each episode will make you stay awake and aware. The atmosphere is so intense.
- Realistic dilemma choices faced by the students in the conflicts.
- Zombie species is developed well. You won't find this development in any drama before.
-

Cons:
- Some plot holes are there (like why this student faces this kind of problem etc are not explained) but somehow the entire plot can bury those.
- Main leads failed to lead the show. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing. But I gratitude they failed. Choi Namra is a hard carry in this drama! <3
- Production team forgot to explain the details of how to kill the zombies like killing titans in Attack on Titan where everyone must slice the titans' neck. In this drama, sometimes, the zombies die by getting stabbed on the body, getting sliced on their neck, getting shot on their head, etc randomly. The explanation I remember is that they will die when the ""host"" body is destroyed. But, their ""host"" body isn't destroyed until the near end of the drama. So, those high schoolers actually didn't kill the zombies and just stunned them?
- Unnecessary sexual violence scene (a naked girl that has been bullied).
- There is no epic music :(
- Shibal, there is too much cursing. It's much better if you don't understand Korean lang.
- We need to wait for the next season to see how the plot ends.
- The writer is obviously forcing them to get trapped in the school lmao.

Extra:
Why majority of watchers love Namra more than On Jo? I think it's because Namra's role is the key to their survival while On Jo is always crying all the time and seems cannot live without people around her. So, I hope the writer does justice for the main leads.

FANTASTIC
Okk so i just completed this drama and i am out of words
The way the scenes were portrayed and the fact that the zombie scenes were choreographed is just amazing
Amazing acting by all the actors i really like how there were so many characters and everybody played an important role and they were not just their.
The story was the usual story that u will see in any zombie related drama
But there was one thing that i appreciate they actually also showed the side of military and what they are were doing to prevent the virus
Although all the actors were amazing my personal fav was namra and sihyuk they were just amazing and their chemistery is to die for
So now u might ask what is something that differentiate this drama from other zombie drama
So the answer to that is nothing
Lets be practical and think what else they can show in a zombie drama other than surviving,fighting and ofcourse zombie but is it worth watching ???
And the answer is a big YESSSSS
Trust me you will not regret a single min
Although the whole drama was phenomenal and amazing i am not sure what do i feel about the ending though
It just doesn't feel right
So the conclusion is that it is worth watching even though i don't like the ending the whole drama was fullfilling

A bit overhyped but expectant for Season 2
I loved the beginning and the ending, but the in between felt a bit dragging and it was like we were going in circles with what was happening. It's a fun show to watch with friends and family, if everyone's into zombies and gore, but in terms of writing, I think they could've done a better job with the pacing or they could've just shortened it to like 5-8 episodes or just opted for a movie.

I appreciate the morals of it as well as giving the creator of the virus an actual motivation that makes you think about things in a different perspective. It's an okay show but I somewhat think it was overhyped.

The leading characters were also a bit confusing to me. Were they trying to go for something like FRIENDS wherein everyone was the leading character? Because if they were, I think they somewhat failed because Nam-ra and Su-hyeok had more main character energy and presence than anyone else in the cast (no offense though).

But despite all this, I'm definitely sticking around for a Season 2.

Just finished watching this series and wow.
I love Korean products that talk about zombies, this amazed me, it was a mix of emotions. I laughed, cried, screamed, felt sorry for the characters, got upset about some adult choices, and empathized totally with them.
I find it a fantastic product, the relationships between people and the reactions they have really amazed me.
I hope a sequel comes out, I want to see them again.

it is a must watch series
honestly this is by far the best zombie series I've watched
the acting from each artists is amazing, you really start feeling for each character right from the beginning
there is a lot blood so you have to watch it if your okay with watching it. It does highlight like how in some of the schools their are still students who are bullied and the extreme pain they go through. there are a lot of stories taking place simultaneously you really get everyone's character arc. this also show the cruel reality of being a teenager where your neither a child nor an adult. The value of having friends and just to be happy. honestly for me zombies are more worst than ghost because there is no cure other than killing and they are your own loved once.
In the end there is always hope don't lose humanity...

Brutal
This series is brutal, it's not shy on letting the characters experience losing friends and family right in front of their own eyes in the most gruesome manners. Yes, I think there are stupid things that happened, but the story was gripping, and heart wrenching. Score and the zombie makeup were nicely done too.

I think the series concluded nicely, but I'd love to see what they'll bring in season 2 if there's one. Definitely a great watch if you're into zombie flicks and don't mind a highschool drama.

enjoyable watch, could have been better though
i think that as a whole this drama was good, yes there were plotholes here and there, yes some of the characters didnt get any good character development and their role seemed pointless, but despite this i still wanted to watch till the end and i really did like (most) of the cast !

i think that there were areas that could have been explored more eg the archery team members i forgot their names… and i think that onjo’s dad’s plot was poorly written.. the ending also was kinda disappointing but maybe there will be a season 2? idk..

bearing in mind how young a lot of the cast were, especially as it was filmed in 2020 (i think) , i think they all did really well !!

Disappointing
I think a lot of the good talent in this series was underused. The writing was sloppy and superficial in trying to pull the heartstrings of the viewer. They spend much time on less important characters than focusing on the leads. The storyline is everywhere, following lesser characters instead of fleshing out the leads and giving the viewers time to get to know and care for the main leads. People disappear and reappear making the storyline choppy and frustrating. In 12 episodes this series could have been wrapped up tightly and neatly. Instead we got a lot of jerk kids whom we barely knew and didn't much care about.

The main thread of this show is the consequences of bullying. Everything that happens subsequently is the result of the students' bullying of one another. That bullying leads to revenge, which leads to disaster. It was a depressing show with little lighter moments. The stars here really are the zombies. The most frustrating part of this show is the lack of continuity. Storylines begin and then are abandoned to give other characters more air time. Those abandoned characters aren't heard from for several episodes before they come back only to disappear for longer stretches again. It was entertaining, but not well written or gripping as Train to Busan. For all the comparison that the show itself makes to the movie, this is NO Train to Busan. This series is gorier, slower, and not as well written. It leaves you feeling run down, disappointed, and sad in the end.

some of us are dead
i wanted to say, that i liked the more slow paced story at the start. it introduced us to so many different characters and plotlines. some of them were even likeable. however... it got repeating. i liked how they werent scared to kill of characters (like i-sak) even tho they were really close to MC, but when you keep killing characters, it just gets repetitive . some of the deaths were actually super unnecessary (looks at on jo's dad). this had such potential. but i think the main problem was so many plotlines AND SO MANY plotholes.
i also think this wouldve been so much better as a choice-based game, like detroit become human.

jauh lebih oke kalau dibandingkan dengan drama serupa sebelumnya (happiness), alurnya lambat tapi detailnya lumayan oke (dan menurut w ini syarat pembuatan cerita nyeremin kaya gini). emosinya campur aduk banget; greget, kesel, ngeri, sedih, sampe cheesy juga ada. sayangnya terlalu banyak karakter ngga penting yang kehadirannya ngga jelas dan sebenernya ngga begitu dibutuhin; salah satunya ya itu si anak perempuan yang hamil itu. di luar itu memang agak sulit untuk bikin 'pembaruan' dalam pembuatan cerita zombie karna pasti bakal mirip-mirip sama yang udah ada sebelumnya, tapi overall ini oke banget si, enjoyable!

Favorite zombie series ever, ignore negative reviews!
I am sorry but I'm baffled by some of the negative reviews. I want to contrast it with The Walking Dead which is seen as the greatest zombie series.

All of Us Are Dead is very addictive. Makes you feel claustrophobic in the best possible way. The fear factor of the zombies retained throughout the series. It wasn't like The Walking Dead where zombies merely walk and are treated like jokes.

Another way it wasn't like The Walking Dead is that there is never a dull moment on this show. They keep the plot moving and don't spend too much time in sub-plots away from the main scenes. The formula was just perfect.

Yet another way it wasn't like The Walking Dead is that on this show, they didn't turn it into a political game of humans vs humans. It remained loyal to its gripping core, a zombie survival series.

I never watch K dramas set in High Schools, but this was just brilliant.

I wish there's a Season 2 and they stay loyal to their current winning formula.

Do Not Miss This Drama. Must Watch
This drama is by far one of the most entertaining 'zombie' dramas which I have come across. I loved ""Train To Busan"" which aired in 2016 and no other Zombie movie or drama has come close, until now.

All Of Us Are Dead gives us a refreshing perspective of how Zombies are dealt with by teenage students from a Korean High School. One would think that it will be kid stuff. As I entered it's first episode, I found that nothing about the show is 'kiddish'. This is one drama that had me on the edge of my seat right until the last episode. The speed of which human transformed into Zombies was mind boggling and to see the students having to think on their feet and coping with disagreements, friendship, love, sacrifice and even putting their studies to good use, enthralled me, as they kept moving forward to save themselves in throes of un-certainty.

All the teenagers in this drama deserve compliments for their acting especially Yoon Chang Young (Chung San) and Park Soloman (Soo Hyuk). There were nine of them who carried most of the episodes, and their friendship was comfortable to watch. They truly had each others' back.

Regardless of which genre of dramas you belong to, this drama is worth the day and time for you to sit back and make time to watch. The show is well directed, acting met the mark, the scenes well captured and most important, the Zombies performed in perfection. I watched a 'behind the scene' for this show and all the actors took many hours to rehearse their Zombie movement. Such dedication was well reflected and brought much authenticity to the drama.

I look forward to the continuation of ""All Of Us Are Dead"". The show left us in anticipation of what could have happened to some of the transformed students and all other possibilities. I look forward to watching all the savvy, kick ass students coming together in their continued journey to survive amongst Zombies ..... or not?

This series is highly recommended for you to watch. Do not carry a high expectation, in case you get disappointed. Perhaps, just keep an open mind.

Enjoy!

Should you watch it?....
""All of Us Are Dead"" is one of my new top favorites. The plot was scripted very well and the director did a good job overall. I do feel bad for the cast because of everything they had to go through. However, all of their hard work has paid off. Great acting, visuals, music, and storyline. I would 100% watch it again. If you think it looks interesting but aren't a huge fan of zombies, blood and gore. Give this film a shot. I love thrillers, but I have never been huge on zombies or lots of blood/gore. But I really got into this film.

Teenage drama with zombies
All of Us Are Dead (2022)

Likes
1. Cheongsan and Suhyeok friendship. CS always leads and SH follows him. But Suhyeok didnt even cry when CS died but was willing to get bitten by Namra.
2. Joonyeong, Hyeongsu, Wujin who sacrificed themselves to save their friends. Even Isak's death was sad.
3. Onjo's dad who found a way to save his daughter.
4. I didnt like Onjo and Namra to end up with the two boys and they really didn't haha!
5. They tried to add depth to the story but hard when there's too many characters but at least they still tried, even for just the main team.

Dislikes
1. Gwinam won't die!! There's no explanation why he is super strong and recovers fast other than needing to have a villain in the school.
2. Namra was useless as a halfbie. She just served as their radar to detect other zombies. She is supposed to have special strength like Gwinam but during zombie attacks she hides behind and do nothing except in the end. Actually most of the girls were pretty much useless and let the boys do the fighting. Onjo as the lead was a damsel in distress.
3. Unnecessary deaths like Onjo's dad, Cheongsan, Wujin.
4. Unnecessary plot like the preggy girl, Jaeik, assemblywoman, youtuber, little girl.
5. Unresolved issues like Nayeon should have had a chance to ask forgiveness but got killed by Gwinam. Gwinam fighting with Cheongsan instead of Eunji getting her revenge. Aftermath of Hyosan bombing. How to stop the virus.

I still enjoyed this despite the dislikes. Better if they kept this at 8 or 10 eps. Not sure about the ending.

The world is hell with or without the zombies
It's a longer ride than usual, with 12 hours of runtime, it works perfectly to capture how the youths are pretty much exhausted surviving the living hell of a society with or even without the zombies. The Koreans are always good not only on the actions during apocalypse, but they further explores the problematic moral views surrounding it, the societal illness which no one else will ever be able to change the system. Definitely appreciate the immense amount of effort from the production team in designing its action choreography and all the great actors, gifting viewers a lively and beautiful zombie series.

binged watched and... worth it!
let me say... im not one for zombie dramas. they just arent my vibe. but this zombie drama was something else, it always kept me on my toes, made me scream/shout and also cry. i really hope there is a 2nd season to see how their life moves on, there isnt much of a cliffhanger but i still want a 2nd season.

i wish they made it to 10 episodes because there was unnecessary scenes and parts that i skimmed through, and some extra characters that were wasted off. you will love and hate some characters and maybe fall in love with 1 or 2. i would recommend this show if youre bored and need a new drama.

My favorite Zombie show ever
Yes, there are some little plot holes - I'll get to those later - but overall, this was amazing. There were episodes where I was completely glued to the screen and did not dare to move. I've watched many zombie shows and movies but this is now by far my favorite. The drama starts out good, then becomes really amazing and fast-paced, then there's one episode that is slower and less plot-driven, but it is a nice breather before the final few action-filled episodes.

The young actors all did amazing jobs bringing these characters to life. The good characters, as well as the bad, that viewers really really hate. I found On Jo kind of annoying but I guess that's part of her character. I loved that there was no plot armor and anyone could die at any time - major characters included.

I guess the only questions I had are the following:
- Does anyone who gets bitten by Gwinam only turn into a ""Hambie""? The characters assume this, because both Gwinam and Namra, who was bitten by him, are Hambies. And Soohyeok even says to Namra ""If you bite me, I will only turn into what you are."" But then why did Nayeon, who was also bitten by Gwinam, turn into a full zombie??
- If you have Namra in your group, who is immune to the Zombies, why not just let her bite everyone in the group in order to get out of the school? Kind of like a vaccine?
- Did all her friends forget that On Jo got bitten by that first girl who got bitten by the hamster? Shouldn't she have turned into either a Hambie or a Zombie, or be immune to everything? Maybe the second season will reveal that she's got like super-immunity, but why did none of her friends stop and think ""hey, didn't you get bitten?""

Definitely survival of the fittest..
Another take on the zombie apocalypse genre. It's good enough to keep me hooked on the show. I've watched plenty from this genre, so I had high expectations.

I think the show has a cohesive way of story telling. The writers aren't lazy. They provided a plausible explanation for every twist and turn and yet left enough space to maneuver for
hopefully another season.

From the backstory of the main characters to each character development. From highschool bullying to teenage pregnancy. From unrequited love to unconditional love of a parent to a child. From animosity to friendship to selfless love and loyalty. The show ain't perfect but it's good.

Actors were really good too, so many familiar faces.. that gave some heart wrenching moments. OST's good too.. I wouldn't mind watching another season of this show.

Did not live up to the amazing preview, potential and zombie expectations
Amazing preview, potential and the beginning of the series; but once you start watching it further, the potential unravels and stressful angst on what these characters do starts

Life is too short for stressful drama. Why spend all that time watching and be stressed? Don’t our lives already provide enough of that?

Summary of the series:
- an attempt to a great zombie series; series slows after the beginning
- a bit of stress watching it, had to fast forward some due to the many mis-opportunities, zero trust when surviving together (if there is no trust, why stay together)
- added super zombies and of course lets fight them without weapons as much as we can
- bad decision making though out that some time it doesnt even make sense, but need to add it for the cinematography and extend the story (lets all stay on top of a roof where there is no food)
- good zombie cinematography
- some struggles, add bad guys, calamity or miscommunications to cause more drama, stress to extend the series
- cant finish and had to drop it; its not the zombie land which I was hoping for and its very awkward and trust issues

If you are looking for bad decision making and zero trust among the character about zombies, super zombies with gratuitous stress/drama, frequent cringey out of no where throw-in jabs, insipid side stories, then this is for you.

All of Us Are Glad That It's Over
I felt pretty strongly that I wouldn't enjoy ""All of us are dead"" from the trailer, but I decided to stomach it after really enjoying Park Solomon's acting with Kim Hyang-gi in ""Sweet Revenge"". I found his character and acting in ""All of us are dead"", as Lee Su-hyeok, refreshing, and probably most enjoyed the 'bromance' he had with Yoon Chan-young's character (Lee Cheong-san). Though I have to admit it wasn't a standout ""WOW"" performance, his character was probably the only reason i watched to the end and his acting was consistent.

As for the drama overall, my major criticisms are these:
-The writing was unfortunately really flat. There wasn't much of a plot to begin with. The only parts i found really enjoyable was the characters drop kicking zombies, and the minor internal distresses the group had.
-There were too many female damsels in distress who were intentionally written to be dumb, the main FL being a prime example.
-There's nothing to really focus on or hope for with this drama. Even one of the main conflicts with Gwi nam doesnt actually make much sense.
-The acting messed me up, more on that below.

THE ACTING:
-The acting of the main female lead, Park Ji-hu (On-jo), was completely unbearable. Everything about her acting was completely flat: her voice sounded the same whether she was happy, distressed, scared, ""brave"", supportive etc. Her facial expressions were worse-- in her sad scenes I could only tell she was sad by the single tear drop strategically placed on her cheek. Otherwise she almost always appeared as though she was either bored or irritated. To give the actress a tiny break, the character of On-jo herself really sucked. She was supposed to be resourceful, being a firefighter's daughter but instead she was completely useless and only saved by plot armor whenever she actually came in contact with zombies. I skipped a bunch of this character's ""most impactful scenes"" because the acting annoyed me so much. Literally skipped her reaction to her father's death, Cheong-san's death and parting with Nam Ra because i felt her acting literally made the scene worse. I don't know what went wrong and i dont know if i disliked the character of On-jo or the actress's portrayal of her but the outcome is the same-- i would have totally excluded this character if i could, and if she wasn't present i might actually rate this drama's acting much higher at maybe 7/10 or 6.5/10 rather than 3/10.
-What was worse for me was that the side characters did too much of a better job than this main FL, which in my opinion should never be the case. Even the actress for the archer girl Ha-Ri and actress for Mi-jin did a better job and we didn't see much of them at all.
-As a second female lead Cho Yi-hyun as Nam-Ra also did a better job as well.
-The cast's relationship with each other was really fun. If i could separate scores for acting and cast i'd give cast a 6/10 and acting a 3/10.
-I actually enjoyed Im Jae-hyuk's (Dae-su) character and felt he made some otherwise dull scenes slightly more enjoyable.
-I also felt Yoon Chan-young's (Lee Cheong-san) acting and character were decent as well but I might be biased because he was a primary zombie drop-kicker so I don't know that i cared that much about the emotional weight of his character. I still felt his portrayal of the emotional range of his character was decent.



The Good:
-The best part of this drama for me was drop-kicking zombies
-The connection of the cast with each other
-The bromance of the two male leads
-The suspense of them getting out of some situations earlier on in the series
-Letting one person in their inner group become a halfie zombie was interesting as a concept but not executed in the best way
-The camera work was largely pretty good at capturing the action in ways that feel you're right there with the characters

The Bad (just about everything else):
-The acting of the main FL was really stiff for me (i just cant get over this)
-The writing seemed to only care about tying all 1000 extra characters in with the main group of students. It wasn't tight writing.
-Why do they have 1000 extra characters? They should have focused on the main side characters.
-They really didn't need to insert romance into resting moments of the characters, it felt forced
-They wrote the female lead to not use her brain and be useless while pretending she's brave. She was a decent emotional support nearing the end but that wasn't enough to redeem this character for me.
-Killing off characters is only impactful when you know they had to die and their deaths were meaningful. Most of the character deaths were completely uncalled for (ex On-Ju's father, the archer dude, Cheong-san's mother ,the female teacher Na-yeon and many more)
-Childish sense of morality ""you did bad--now you die"" was repeated literally for every character-- even ones not turned into zombies, like that Chief of Defense who (SPOILER) bombed the city then took his own life. Why did they do that to his character?
-The whole Gwi nam hunting for Cheong-san thing actually made no sense, yet it was supposed to be a central part of the plot and climax, why?
-The music was trash. I literally muted some moments to escape the soundtrack at times.


Summary:
""All of Us Are Dead"" was for the most part good for mindless entertainment--you could be a zombie watching it and still get the jist of it. It doesn't strive to be smart (and it isn't), it doesn't strive to be philosophical or deep (and it isn't). It's just a slightly better than mediocre bit of fun and though it wasn't high quality at all, I still moderately enjoyed it for the reason i watched it--mindless fun. Despite my moderate enjoyment I don't actually recommend it. There aren't enough redeeming points to give it above a 2 for me; still if i ever feel like I particularly don't want to use my brain while watching something I might give this a partial rewatch.

total critical rating: 2/10
mindless entertainment rating: 6/10

Fun ride...
I was initially a skeptic when I saw that this would be a series instead of a movie. Because, how long can you drag a zombie apocalypse??

Was i ever wrong! From the very first episode, I was drawn in to the world of Hyosan high school students. The series had a perfect balance of light and scary moments. Comedic lines were properly timed just when you need a break from the heavy, adrenaline pumping, zombie chases.

But what I really liked about this, was the valid reason why the Professor invented the virus in the first place. The viewers were not left to wonder as to why these zombies came about. Unlike The Walking Dead, wherein no explanation was given as to their presence.

I still have a few episodes left, but I am wishing for another season already....

Poorly written, filler characters, unnecessary scenes.
Let me start by saying I'm a fan of the genre, and I really like Kingdom.
I was looking forward to this serie, and was very excited when I saw the trailer.

All of Us Are Dead can be quite entertaining if you just care about the gore and the adrenaline of the characters being chased by pretty fast zombies. But it has a major problem: there are too many characters and groups. None of them are interesting or developed enough for you to get attached and care about them, and there is too much stupidity happening even for a teen-centric story. It also lacks actual action in the killing zombies department.

The ""hero"" is likable enough and active. Some might even find his teenage awkwardness relatable. But I found a lot of his scenes with the second lead, which were meant to be humorous, extremely cringy and ridiculous. Think about this, who the hell would want to talk about ""girls/boys"" while standing outside of a window on the 3rd floor, with zombies everywhere? Survival instinct and urgency seems to slip their minds a lot actually.

Then is this serie supposed to be a comedy like Zombieland?
That's the thing, I don't think it's meant to be a comedy but it ends up becoming one.

Also, if you're a female viewer expecting to see a strong female heroine, I'm sorry to tell you this is one of those that only show women as dumb, useless and annoying. The one female character that has potential is hardly shown which is very disappointing.

I don't want to drop this serie yet, so I marked it as such. But I have doubts that I will be able to complete it.

Commendable yet Forgettable
I decided to drop it after three episodes. The zombie genre has been milked a thousand times before, yet this is the first time I saw an addition to the genre that utterly disregards those before it. It was frustrating just for the sake of it, so things would keep on happening. Plot devices are used numerous times in the same episode with the same results. It is not ground breaking. The cast was phenomenal. But with a questionable script, unless you have anything else to do, you might be better off watching something else. May I recommend Season 1 of Kingdom - a top-tier zombie series.

All of us are Inlove over Park Solomon?
It's actually not that bad. The story was quite amazing, the characters portrays well, and the friendship is perfect


I don't need a season 2 for this drama. It was all so satisfying for me. Perfect in every way.
This is more than just about zombies. This is about social issues, like bullying and prejudices and how social status affects how you are treated by society. It all actually started because of bullying and how it was not given importance by authorities.
In the end, everyone will be equal in a situation like this. Everyone is affected no matter your social status is. Can you save others or just yourself? Will you sacrifice others to live or will you sacrifice yourself for them to live.
Friendship may develop or enemies may be made. The decision depends on you.

So giving a name tag means Let’s date?
Oof Let’s start with this, I was actually excited for this drama -for real. I don’t craze for horror but I enjoy gore which there is a difference. Seeing how creative one can get with zombie gore is what I was looking forward to. In this case I felt “creativity” went out the window. Zombies were just the same as any other and it was unclear the whole time how to kill them, for some it seemed like an arrow or knife to the neck was enough but other times it didn’t work, no consistency whatsoever. The storyline felt like they wanted to tell a little bit of every characters story but none of there personalities got fully fleshed out. Quite frankly, by the end I didn’t even remember some of their names… that is what little impact they had on me. So many missed opportunities in this show too, for example there are a few characters like the girl who was in the room with the food who I felt could have had a really rich development arc and the bullied girl as well, so much potential! Made me wish I was with the script writers and push them harder because really that was what was lacking-editing the story. The way it ended felt more like this could have just been better off as a movie. It really didn’t need to be that long, I could have lived without the false hope of some of the characters outcomes. Very disorganized show, if you are fond of creativity then just pass this one and re-watch train to busan.

worth the wait
i dont really get why so many people are hating on the show in these reviews. i was waiting for quite some time, quite confused about what it would be about, but overall im really impressed. quite a few tears were shed, especially in the camera scene. although, definitely DO NOT watch if you can handle blood, intestines, eye gauging, and overall major GORE. also, my fav character is girl boss queen eunji?so if there is a season 2, i def need to know what happens to her (??netflix kor *wink wink nudge nudge*)

If you liked Train to Busan, You will love this one.
This is a great drama. Don’t listen to people who rated it low. It was clear as glass in the trailer what to expect. I did not give it ten because the romance was really unnecessary. There wasn’t even a need for that. And also they wasted the SML. There wasn’t even a need for his role other than defending his love and kicking zombies. The ML was really good. Both FL and SFL were great too but it would’ve been so much better if they just kept SFL alone because the FL didn’t really have any part to play other than lose her loved ones. The other characters are all likeable too. This is definitely worth a rematch but I hope they will bring back the main lead again because the ending literally hinted it(kinda). So if there will ever be season 2, they can’t really take the story far with SFL alone. This is worth every hype for a zombie show. 12 hours of zombie survival mode???what more do you need!!

P.S. Ep5 is literally best episode in the whole show. 1 hour of intense zombie chasing I’ve ever seen.

Extreme highs and lows without enough heart.
I know nothing about the webtoon, but ""All of Us Are Dead"" being another Korean Zombie story was enough to pique my interest. The story itself feels pretty standard, with the expected tropes, yet still unique. The zombies are well done and realistically creepy, but something about this series disappoints and it was hard to put a finger on why while watching. Now that I've finished I think I understand what stopped me from loving this drama, the convoluted back story, and too many main characters that I didn't like or care about. It's hard to get invested in a zombie story if you don't care if they get eaten or not. Don't get me wrong, I loved the concept behind how the zombies were created, but that part didn't get enough focus, and I loved the school setting, but too many moments in this show seemed to drag out with too many characters that fell flat or were too stereotypical. The main one being Park Ji Hoo as Nam On Jo. Yes, she was a realistic teen, but her salty attitude throughout was more annoying than empathetic. Seeing zombies chase students gets super repetitive when you don't care enough about the people being chased.

Nam On Jo is just one of the main group of students we follow through this fast escalating zombie crisis. There's Lomon as Soo Hyeok the strong and crushworthy, Jo Yi Hyun as antisocial class President Nam Ra, and Yoon Chan Young as Chung San, my favorite character, the classic sympathetic hero. The rest of the classmates are a mix of bullies, clowns, snobs, BFFs, and assorted personalities you're likely to find in your average basic teen drama, but because things escalate so quickly some characters felt too generic to make me sympathize enough. In the middle of the chaos, we are faced with who likes who and who resents who, cliques, classism, bullying, bonding, selfishness, and insane revenge but because I didn't care enough about most of their relationships or feelings, I was left waiting for the next ""event"" to happen to them. I will admit that there was always an epic event on the horizon, often a pretty shocking one that kept me wanting to watch the next episode, but the time in between those events got pretty boring. Maybe I was looking for more chemistry between characters, or a stronger origin story since visually the show does an amazing job. Nothing about the acting is bad, it's just not as emotionally exciting as it was visually exciting. The story itself is definitely heavy on emotional ""moments"" but they left me dry-eyed when they normally wouldn't so I must partially blame the cast. Unforgettable scenes filled with mostly forgettable characters are the result. There is an extremely memorable extreme bully (with a mullet) but the rest of the cast is pretty generic. Lee Yoo Mi as Na Yeon is one of the few characters with a clear story arc, likable or not. Don't even get me started on the baby, or the little girl... too many wasted and unexplored storylines to count.

Would I watch this again, Oddly yes. I think knowing the story and characters better may make earlier scenes better too. It's a shorter series, 12 episodes, which is also a decent binge length. I also probably missed some important key things in some episodes while distracted by the shock of the zombies. This seems like the kind of drama that may make more sense with a second viewing. I would definitely be tempted to skip many scenes, especially the bio teacher's video diaries, but I know there are probably details I missed while bored. I was also satisfied with the ending, although a little disappointed that the zombie mess had no clear resolution and felt rushed to an end.

If you are a zombie fan, then this is worth watching. At least for some good and terrible zombie survival strategies. If you hate gore and violence but love a good drama, you honestly may want to skip this one. This drama is gory and dark and explores survival instincts, trust, loyalty, and is pretty high on lost faith in humanity points, but without a major throughline besides basic survival, the story is the weakest part of this drama. It is suspenseful, but the suspense is based on who will survive and who won't. There's really great 'WTH did I just watch' end of episode suspense to keep viewers hooked, but the zombie lore was pretty messy with plot holes I would have noticed more if I cared more. Some of the social commentary is pretty heavy-handed and doesn't go deep enough to feel relevant, which I think is this drama's overall issue. The Drama ""Happiness"" did a better job of telling a zombie survival genre and social commentary story without being too preachy... shout out for Bae Hae Sun for having to go through Zombies again! lol! Although this time her character seemed more like a glorified cameo.

Overall, ""All of Us are Dead"" is another Zombie drama for our times. Since this pandemic has many people questioning how we deal with a sudden crisis, and Zombie movies are a great way to explore Human Nature and Instincts, the timing of this series is perfect. What I didn't expect was a story filled with high adrenaline-inducing zombies to feel so tedious and I certainly didn't expect to have so many 'rooting for the zombies to eat someone' moments. Arguing, running, fighting, arguing, more running, and more fighting... the fight and zombie choreography is pretty epic, but I wish this drama's emotional moments matched the action. I can definitely see this being left somewhat open-ended for the possibility of a season 2, which I would watch, but not with super high expectations. Not quite overrated, but not as good as it could have been. I just know if zombies come I'm avoiding all teens. lol!

Literally wasted my time
I must assume people who loved this show are probably young teenagers who don't pay enough attention to notice the actual lack of logic, loopholes and pointless characters in this drama. I can't remember the last time I've seen something with so little logic and so many characters who are overly emotional but at the same time selfish, dumb and inconsistent with their actions.
I also don't know why they wasted the characters who were actually interesting and played by good actors (unlike the main characters). I could literally think of a thousand better ways to develop or even kill these characters. I really don't understand this to the point that I'm wondering if someone actually watched this drama before putting it up on Netflix.

Beyond than my high expectations!
When the first trailer of All of us are dead out, I immediately have high expectations for it and I'm glad that it exceeds my expectations heh.

Train to Busan and World War Z - 2 movies that are high on the best movie list and let me say All of us are dead should be placed next to them as well. Its amazing that it has an emotional rollercoaster. It can get you angry, sad, laughing, being curious, hatred towards a character, the intense feeling and all possible emotions you could think of - its like you are one of the students who is surviving and going through all this stuff.

The casts are amazing - the acting level is beyond. Music gets your tenses worked up or leaves you crying the hell out of you.

Last but not least, THE CAMERA SHOTS!!! The camera shots are amazingly well-done. Why? Yes, it keeps you worked up but what is amazing is that - they provide the first person's point of view. Like I said before, it makes you feel like you're one of the characters but it also makes you think that ""this is actually what it looks and feels like if the apocalypse did occur"". And someone like me would add ""I can guarantee that I will be the first to die if that happens"".

Go check out the webtoon too if you haven't already!

Anyways I will end here but my last review note is to say ""Don't do prank calls""...

Disappointed To Say The Least
So I've been wanting to watch this from the day they announced it was being made. With that being said I am so sad that it didn't live up to the hype. As someone who is VERY easy to please I just about never dislike a movie or show especially a zombie one at that.

There are 3 things that ruined this drama for me: 1.) The main ML and Fl characters 2.) The FL actress's acting 3.) the storyline felt predictable and at moments too slow/boring and details added that were not needed.

The side characters are more intriguing and better at acting which makes it painful for me to constantly watch the ML and FL. Plus I HATE the whole childhood friend love plot they included. If they changed the lead actors and didn't include unnecessary scenes I probably would have loved this drama.

The biggest plot twist ever in history...continue reading to find out!!!!!!

Story: (SPOILER)
It starts out with the physician and his assistant visiting the King's chamber. The next day, news broke out that the King is gravely ill, upon hearing the news CP Lee Chang decides to visit to see his father. Upon getting there, the Queen forbids him from seeing him and tells him that if he catches the flu who would be the nation's next King. He later sneaks into the chamber and discovered something gruesome; a shadow-like a beast follows by a foul stench and the smell of blood that could not be described. The thin paper bamboo door suddenly slides open with the guards outside questioning him why he is there. He follows with that there is a beast in the chamber and proceeds to persuade everyone. The head guard tells him there is no such thing and that it must be the tiredness. CP heads on to see his father, but again failed to meet as he was stopped by an official. CP tells about the sighting of the beast and to his amused the official replied back with saying he's seen it too, a son who pretends to be concern about his father but really he wants to see his father dead so he can guarantee his safety to the throne was the monster he has seen (referring to the prince). CP is escorted back and finds out that the last physician to see his father lives in Dongnae and so the journey to see the physician embarks. The next morning, all the official gets together to plot a scheme to kill the CP, and so he was going to be arrested for treason. Meanwhile at Jiyulheon, as the physician returns with the dead body of his assistant, those who was close to the boy was confused and lost about how he had died. Seo Bi, a woman who's also a physician returns from her daily findings of herbs to see all the sick patients happily eating. Confused as there is shortage on food and nothing to eat she rushes to the kitchen and sees this guy (honestly I can't remember his name or did he even have a name, can someone confirm with me cause I really can't remember/ gonna call him GUY1) Seo Bi asked him where he got the food from and he tells her that he hunted a deer. Pleased that everyone gets to eat meat, she was asked to refill another bowl of delicious meat soup and so she proceeds to do so to find out it wasn't a deer. The soup was made from a dead body. Shooketh, not shocked but shooketh, because I was shooketh too, she confronts GUY1 about it, meanwhile, the start of the epidemic starts to happen. CP and his trusted body guard arrives to see the place locked up from the inside and looking like a mess. They get inside and discover the bodies of the dead and sends them to the magistrate. When all hope was lost guys, GUY1 & Seo Bi did not die, yes they did not die and is friggen alive. CP and body guard finds Seo Bi in the mountain looking for a herb that can cure the dead, she finds out that the body has been moved to the magistrate and tells them that the bodies are not dead. They were literally like girl what you on about, but she keeps insisting them that the body will start to rise at night. CP slowing believing her asked her if the creature has a foul stench and blood smells and she said yes, and with this, it proves the theory CP has. CP sends his bodyguard and seo bi to the magistrate to check out what's happening. Seo Bi and GUY1 starts explaining about what the bodies do but no one believed them and they both end up in the jail. As night fall, the bodies starts to become alive and the village becomes the walking dead. The epidemic starts to spread and at this point in time, everyone finds out about the CP. This is basically the story, the CP ends up helping the people and everyone ends up at this city call Sangju, there with the help of his former teacher and his people, they start to build forts and trenches and traps to kill the zombies. As this was unfolding Seo Bi discovers the herb that can cure the epidemic. Back to the traps, they waited all night and nothing showed up, relieved they killed off the fire and everyone was ready to go and rest...and then...as the CP looked into the distance, a disturbance in the wood had set off the bird and the ground was trembling and trees was literally shaking!!!!! Seo Bi hears something and turns around to see that there are the zombies standing behind them,- you can see it in the reflection of the water...BIGGEST FRIGGEN PLOT TWIST she realises that they do not rise during the night but to the temperature, yes temperature. THE END. Another plot twist, the Queen is not pregnant, repeat she is not pregnant. & now the wait for season 2. I literally watched this when I found out it was on netflix via IG and I literally stopped watching my current drama because I was that excited to see it. I can't even explain it lmao, but like each episodes had it's own feels like my siblings and I we were so into it that like we commentate the whole series cause we didn't want bad things to happen t the good people and we were rooting for the bads to get eaten by the zombies. haha. But check it out.

Acting/Cast:
It was soooooo good, like props to everyone who has to run like that like yalls MVP of the year already.

Rewatch:
I would definitely rewatch this and rewatch it when season 2 comes out.

Overall:
Everyone has to watch it like its sooo good, like I could not find any fault with it. Like its amazing. Shoutout to NETFLIX for being MVP and subbing this.

This is a tough one to rate. I am so used to the normal k-drama series where there is no second season. There is always a solid conclusion at the end of it's 16, 20, or whatever episode run. But here, you are waiting for what presumably looks like is going to be the show's biggest action scene yet, and then boom! ....Sorry, wait until next year. REALLY!

Ending aside, this show is a lot of fun. It's a blockbuster type of drama. While there is story and character around the monarchy, with it's lead character of the crown prince, the show isn't too concerned with character development and a deep storyline. In many ways it fits in the disaster film genre. It isn't so much about its characters as it is more about the epidemic surrounding them. Which I think is fine. It presents itself as an epic and violent action feature, and it succeeds at that. The acting is great. The effects are great. It's a fun one to watch for sure. But damn you for making us wait a year on that type of cliffhanger.

Korea has always loved glorifying and immortalising into “ period dramas” from their gold age of history ( now commonly known as the “ Joseon Period” - 1392-1897). With more than six centuries of historical monarchal reigns, wars and rebellions, it is notable that South-Korean screenwriters again and again love to retell these events to viewers with expensive sets, hanboks ( traditional Korean dress) and idyllic scenery from a bygone age .

Whilst Joseon period drama have attempted to tackle crossovers of popular genres such as romance and action before with different results ( either for better or for worse), the more surreal take of horror/ fantasy in Joseon period dramas ( notably Scholar Who Walks The Night, Arang And The Magistrate and in flashbacks from the hit series Goblin), have very rarely depicted levels with historical realism or a grounded depiction ( I.e. in terms of cleanliness, monarchs or violence) of actual life during this period.

Screenwriter Kim Eun Hee ( Ghost, Signal) and director Kim Sung Hoon ( Tunnel-2016, Kidnapped- TBC) were paramount from the get-go to revolutionise this in their horror -period drama Kingdom . This creates a surprisingly brilliant fusion between the surrealism of violent zombies into a political and social critique of the bloodthirsty and ruthless Joseon period and hierarchy .( Although labelled as a “ zombie show”, realistically , the word “ zombie” isn’t used once by any of the characters, due to the concept itself coming from Haitian folklore and not even entering the English language until the 1800s.)

Set in the 1500s , Kingdom revolves around the estranged and traitorous Prince Lee Chang ( Ju Ji Hoon) , whose fate as the successor to the throne looks grim with the recent announcement of his stepmother and the young Queen Cho ( Kim Hye Joon) ‘s pregnancy. Chang, however, becomes suspicious when his father is suddenly ailing from a mysterious illness which nobody will elaborate about outside of the palace. After stumbling upon the truth that his father is a flesh -eating creature, he travels to the South in search of questions with his trusted guardsman Moo Young ( Kim Sang Ho). Naturally, however, they are not the first to stumble upon this truth as assistant physical Seo Bi ( Bae Doo Na) and the mysterious Young Shin ( Kim Sun Gyu) also come across this startling discovery, which will truly test alliances and friendships as a political bloodbath simultaneously corrupts even the heart of Hanyang ( now present- day Seoul)...

It is undeniable that the “ violent zombie” cliche isn’t anything new , nor exciting to television programmes . On the other hand, Kingdom’s strength lies in its focal point ( unlike many zombie programmes) not being on the undead, but the complexity and intricacy of humans.

From Lee Chang’s strong sense of morality towards his allies ( of all classes), Cho Beom-pal ( Jeon Seok- ho)’s gradual transition from one of the selfish members of the ruling-class to someone with a good heart , and the Queen’s ulterior motives against her father’s knowledge , it is notable that the majority of the characters in the show are fairly three-dimensional. Arguably, antagonist Cho Hak-Ju ( Ryu Seung Ryong) can often be written off as your typical moustache-twirling villain, however, there is still a notable level of depth to his character- a bereaving father who has lost his son and is out for revenge against Lee Chang , desperate to protect his family’s lineage and has many more secrets than first meet the eye.

Undeniably, the pacing of the show can be a little slow in the beginning, however, once the events of the show kick off, it is fair to say that time flies out of the window when watching Kingdom- the plot is engaging, the historical elements are surprisingly realistic, the characters are actually intriguing and the horror premises ( zombies, cannibalism and bloodshed etc.) are certainly not for the faint-hearted. Nevertheless, perhaps the one thing which should honestly be said about the show is that whilst the acting certainly wasn’t unwatchable and the actors undeniably had their moments of genuinely good performances , some acting in the show was often a little wooden and lacklustre.

Overall whilst Kingdom was undeniably slightly flawed by quality of acting and pacing at times, it was certainly a good show with an intriguing balance between history and horror as well as a deeper conceit towards a social critique contemporary of Korean society. Certainly worth a watch, if you’re looking for something to invest time and effort towards.

Imma give you straight away two reasons that should sell this drama to you:
1. Netflix production = Quality television
2. Kim Eun-hee (Signal writer) = Quality writing

I’ve been out of the kdrama scene for… personal reasons, for a year and a half now and this drama was announced all the way back when my life was heavily drama-driven. Imagine my excitement when my beloved Netflix actually released this.

Long story short, Kingdom = Zombies in Joseon era. And… lemme stop you there. Zombies is in no way a new concept. In fact we’ve been living in the decade of zombie and post-apocalyptic future TV craze with most shows ending up being a shadow of themselves in later seasons. What’s more zombies have been done by Koreans too, in infamous movies and… mediocre – at best – dramas. However, Kingdom was all but done before. As a fan of post-apocalyptic TV shows and zombies themselves, this drama felt like a complete breath of fresh air. Not only was it a post-apocalyptic historical drama but also it felt exceptionally original.

So what made this – in just 6 episodes – so good?
- Incorporation of classic kdrama troops in an original form.
You got your average, classic historical drama backstory: political conspiracies, throne successors, political struggles to stay in power, corrupted nobles, evil queens ect, implicated with an overall story of a peculiar disease that “make the dead rise and seek for human blood and flesh”.

Which brings me forward to the second original factor:
- Actual explanation of how this shit came to exist
Zombie apocalypse is classic in 2019, we love it, we do. Name a show that actually took the time to explain how this shit happened. Nope! No writer actually went out of his way to try and explain how this happened. It always gets overlooked. But all hail writing Queen Kim Eun-Hee because this bitch gave us a reason. It is nothing groundbreaking and there is no need for it to be, but it is there and it makes as much sense as it needs to please the viewer. This is what i call brave writing, and i commend her on this.

- Plotwists and creativeness
Imma not spoil anything, I’ll just say: episode 6! This was an 8.5 until the last 10 minutes of the season finale. Kim Eun-Hee took an already existing idea and made it hers. Super mini spoiler-alert – zombies run now and that’s not the only new thing about this. At first the zombie classic lore changes felt foreign but there is nothing wrong with experimenting when it actually works!

- *tear* NO ROMANCE
Lemme hear you say YAAAAAAAS and a HALLELUJAH! I’ve been out of the kdrama world for a while now, but from my experience there is no non-OCN drama that won’t shove a romance down our beautiful throats and sorry but I like other things shoved down there (I mean food you freaking pervert!)

- Pacing and Cinematography
Kim Eun-Hee and Netflix makes a good combo cause, bitch that went by FAST and it was the most beautiful thing I’ve seen! Ok that was a stretch but appreciate my enthusiasm. I could easily call the cinematography the best thing about this. Hell each episode cost 1.78 million $ so yes. Netflix went all in, and considering this was renewed in a week, it paid back. The pacing is fast and it makes sense and it introduces new stuff and it has your something new and your something old and honestly, it’s great!

The only reason this doesn’t get anything more from me is because I’d have liked to see more of the characters backstories. Don’t get me wrong, they are well fleshed and super SUPER likeable. But there is somuch content you can add in just 6 episodes and I just missed that. Thankfully the show got renewed, and we got a tiny glimpse of their stories, which felt more like teasing to be honest, so here’s to looking forward to something in the next season.

Last but not least, I enjoyed the splashed comic relief In the episodes. It was there, it felt good, it was small but impactful and did not ridicule any of what was happening. Good writing again Kim Eun-Hee. All hail ect ect….

As far as acting is concerned, lemme be my usual sour self and say: I read that Song Joong Ki was cornered for the lead role but he declined. You know what guys? Some dramas are destined for greatness and… ALL HAIL THE DRAMA GODS FOR LETTING THIS DRAMA BE GREAT!

Phew, it felt good saying that – no offence to his fangirls but I’d like to take my dramas with as little boy-fanservice as possible.

That being said, I think I’ve never seen Ju Ji-hoon before. He was a noble hero, maybe a bit too cliché but it was necessary for the show to continue. I liked him a lot as the lead. And would love to see more of him

Bae Doona. Netflix likes Bae Doona and why wouldn’t they. She rocks, she’s the best *incert fanboying comment here*. I would have liked her to be a little bit more badass, but there was enough badassery here brought by other characters so it’s alright. Let’s make Doona a global star now Netflix ok?

Kim Sung Kyu. Do I know him? I certainly don’t remember him, but boy was he badass? Every character fulfill a purpose and made a flawless zombie-killing squad. The-walking-dead who?

Which brings me to the my fan favourite Kim Sang Ho. We have seen him in tons of dramas. Usually he’s the comic relief right? Correct me if I’m wrong, but he was amazing here, part of the main cast for me. He was the glue that made it work.

Overall, don’t be whiny bitches. This is 6 episodes long, of course it is worth it. Dive in already you won’t stop watching. Can’t wait for the 2nd season.

I felt like I had higher expectations for this. Having watched #Alive and Train to Busan in the past year, I had gotten used to zombie movies with fast action — TtB set the bar super high with its social commentary, and I kind of thought Kingdom would have combo of emotion and action. But it had a lot of politics in it, with a lot of administrative characters that I found hard to tell apart and just wasn't that interested in.

Ultimately, I still really like the aesthetics of the show, and there's a twist that I enjoyed quite a bit. I really like the main characters of the Crown Prince, Gun Guy, and Physician — but didn't really click with anyone else. I also liked the zombie plots in general, but overall it was too much politics, too many side characters who I didn't care about.

Kingdom meshes together the political corruption and power struggles of historical k-dramas with the thrills and gore of good zombie flick. It will be fun for fans of shows like Walking Dead, Game of Thrones or Train to Busan. Have to note that those shows I just mentioned have considerably more depth in their story themes, characters and relationships, but there's enough here to keep viewers invested and entertained.

The GOOD: It's well-produced gore and action- both gross and engrossing. The plot moves at a good pace and keeps you pushing the play button to find out what happens next.

The NOT AS GOOD: The characters are all stereotypical. The heroes are likable but not lovable. The noblemen are aggravatingly corrupt and lame. The peasants are all just one generic group of people that stand for the weak and oppressed. There isn't really any depth to the characters or their relationships with each other.

The BAD: The ending was not satisfying, but that's all I'll say. You're going to have to wait months for Season 2 to get any sense of closure.

But it's a fun watch if you like zombie thrillers.

I guess I had too much expectation for this series. All I saw was good comments about series but it was quite disappointment for me. I don't like zombie stuffs but i could not find something awesome in this series. Even characters are not good . It's just average. Episode 1-2 were quite boring. Only zombie scenes were good, that's it.

I don't think i will rewatch it or watch season two. Only good part is zombies. except for it, nothing :)))))))))
They could have written better story which is more attractive.

Feast for Your Eyes!
Fresh & Unique take on the zombie-genre that's popular in mainstream media over the years. Like every zombie concept, Kingdom is quite simple. A disease breaks out/infects the population/city & people must find a way to survive. What makes this one all more unique is the setting/place of ancient Korea(Joseon), so the genre strips away the usual bombastic/array of explosions, handguns, & tactical gear when fighting off zombies in the typical Hollywood/western fashion.

The limited use of CGI, the practical makeup/usage of actors for the zombies makes up for a more realistic vibe. The sound editing/mixing for the show is really great, specifically for the zombies' transformation
/movements. With only 6 episodes, there's not much room to fully flesh out the characters w/ depth in the usual manner of a 12/25 episode format. Hence, development & events unfolds pretty quickly early on.

The main cast consists of likable characters. Ju Jihoon portrays Prince Chang, the Crown Prince who's an illegitimate/only son of the sickly Emperor, set to rule the current regime/state of Hanyang. He's an empathetic/just character with a mild temper/somewhat reserve nature who learns to understand the plight &
mistreatment of the common folks. Prince Chang becomes embroiled in the political upheaval & conspires to overthrow the Queen/Hak Ju clan's corruption, along with the help of his trusty/dependable personal guard, Mu Yeong.

Bae Doona portrays the thoughtful/kind Seo Bi, a physician's assistant who specializes in herbs/medicine at Jiyulheon clinic located in Dongnae, who tries to find the cure for the unsual outbreak. Even with all the turmoil, she puts the interest/well-being of others first.

Kim Sung Gyu is Yeonshin, who's a bit brash & sinister. He's also has a nicknack for combat/firearm. Much like Prince Chang & Seo Bi, he sympathizes with the common folks. He's member of a hunting clan from Sanju.

The intro/credit is visually pleasing. The overall writing is simplistic. Super straight- forward/
easy to follow. There's a bit of twists, not too shocking but satisfying as mystery unfolds. The dialogue/interactions between characters is decent, not too heavy handed, although there is bit of exposition but lacks depth/complexity. The acting is fine. It isn't overly dramatized but not quite memorable either.

The music score is underwhelming, not quite distinctive. Not much of an emotional core to it, but the dramatic pieces for the more frightening parts is befitting of the tone/atmosphere. The cinematography is beautiful with its wide shots/overpass of scenic views of lush forest/palace buildings. Kingdom reads more like a 6 hour length film then a TV show. The ending is a bit anti-climactic with a cliffhanger & twist. One thing in particular is left unclear, specifically the origin of the disease. If you like zombies & historical fiction mixed with a bit of political intrigue & likable characters without it being muddled, give Kingdom a watch.

If you like Zombies, this is definitely a must-watch. I watched the whole thing in a day because it's short. However, I took several breaks to text people back or watch Youtube videos. That would not have happened if it had REALLY captured me. I like the idea of Zombies in the Joseon era, the production is great, the cinematography beautiful, the acting good. There were definitely some really suspenseful scenes where I barely dared to breathe. But there was not really anything that touched me.

I don't feel like I got to know the characters at all, so I did not get attached to them - not even to the Crown Prince. The only character I enjoyed a bit more was the guard played by Kim Sang Ho, whom I've adored ever since ""City Hunter"" (2011).

Furthermore, I think a better OST would have greatly improved my emotional investment. Am I gonna watch season 2? Yes. But is ""Kingdom"" gonna be on my all-time-favorite Drama list? No.

Listen: this show is exceptionally average. I tapped the 10-second-forward button on Netflix through the whole second half (and the show is only 6 episodes long!)

The first two episodes were actually really solid, since they take place when people are still scared and unsure of what's happening. Once folks become comfortable with defeating the zombies, though, all of the magic and emotion fizzles. The Crown Prince was initially interesting because he WASN'T infallible, but once he's got his footing, he's just another righteous good boy prince. It's boring. The most interesting and likeable character is his bodyguard, if I'm being honest. The ACTING is actually really good from the main cast, but the characters themselves are very plain. The zombie acting is... okay? I've seen it done better.

I think my biggest issue with this show is that it doesn't do anything different. I mean, it's a really cool concept, at least, on PAPER it is. Historical Korean political drama mixed with zombies? Yes, please! The execution isn't very good, though. I actually watched episode 3 with my father and he pointed out how the entire first half of the episode is one continuous action scene. It's bland. Even the political shenanigans don't add much. The queen's pregnancy isn't interesting, the puppet monarchy isn't interesting, the inter-clan fighting isn't interesting, nothing is interesting.

I don't remember the music, that's how unique it was.

This show is downright gorgeous... when the lights are bright enough for you to actually see anything. The makeup, though, didn't look that great to me. I've seen worse large-cast zombie makeup, but that doesn't mean I can't comment on this instance not being very good.

I am not excited for a second season, and even though this season ends on a sort of interesting cliffhanger, I can't guarantee that I will actually WATCH that second season when it comes out. I think it will depend on my mood.

I do not recommend this. It's boring. It's just another zombie story, except, instead of being the length of a movie, it's SIX HOURS long. Watch anything else.

In a Word, Amazing!
Period piece. Political conflict. Action. Suspense. Plot twists. Cliffhangers. And a dash of humor. This drama has EV-ER-Y-THING! Seriously, I cannot sing high enough praises for this drama. And this is coming from someone who is not into zombies (never really got the appeal; more of an Anne Rice girl myself). In fact, going into the show, I wasn't expecting zombies at all (yes, somehow I missed the giant reflection in the sword) and when it was revealed to be one of the premises, I was kind of ""meh"" and a little turned off. That lasted for about a millisecond. Not only were those chase scenes some of the most exhilarating moments in the show, but the interpretation and characterization of the zombies, as well as the role they played in the story was, I thought, cleverly done. Supernatural stuff aside, the political aspects of the plot line were intriguing; I'm really interested to see it develop further in Season 2. And the cinematography, scenery, and sets--breathtaking doesn't even begin to describe them.

With 6 episodes ranging in length from 40 to 60 minutes, this drama is short. However, the screenwriter did a fantastic job of fitting so much in and providing a solid first season. I wish there was a little more explanation and backstory on some things, but I'm hoping (expecting?) we'll get some of that in Season 2. Overall, definitely recommend! But be prepared for a major cliffhanger in the finale. Meanwhile, I'll be joining the fandom as we impatiently wait for Season 2 to be released.

Honestly I watched this to see what the buzz is all about. I’m not a fan of horror genre but I must say I was intrigued on how they would include zombies in a historical setting. Needless to say after finishing episode 1, I’m hooked. The cinematography is amazing. You can tell that they spent a great deal of effort (not just money) to show scenes and views. The twist and element of surprise is good. Actors played their parts well. I read that Song Joong Ki declined the lead role. Wondering if it will be as good if he played the lead role? (I’m a SJK fan ??). No romantic element has been shown yet (for the lead role) but it did not affect the story. This will leave you hanging so you really need to see season 2. Overall I was surprised that I enjoyed this show. Music did not stand out for me. It’s a little bit gorry but it was alright. Although I enjoyed this show, I won’t be rewatching it. If you want something different (not the usual romcom or historical drama) you can give this show a try. ??

While I did enjoy Kingdom for the most part and I though it was shot and acted really well and the production value was excellent, I did find myself struggling a bit with connecting to it emotionally. I don’t think it was the story line, I don’t mind zombies at all and I often enjoy stories that involve them. I think it was more to do with the length of the show and the fact that no matter what the drama seamed to throw at the characters they didn’t really change in any way. The righteous prince was still the righteous prince six episodes later.

And in a story about survival, like Kingdom (or just any story for the matter) I need to be emotionally connected to the characters in order to root for them. I did not feel like any of the characters stood out to me, no matter how well acted they were.

The story line itself was cool and quite interesting. It was, for the most part, a well put-together show. I had been excited about it since it was announced so in a way it was a letdown that I did not find it binge watchable enough. I did have my doubts about the six episode format and that it seemed to want to expand the story to two seasons before the first season aired, like the just cut the story in half. So I only got one half of the story, which annoyed me a little.

My annoyance might come out because that isn’t how I am used to consuming my kdramas. It was interesting to see kdrama with perhaps a little more Netflix style. There are a lot of dramas on Netflix, but most were not made for Netflix and maybe not quite this binge formula in mind - although a lot of dramas are very good for such a binge. It might be that I am more used to the sixteen to twenty four episode dramas, so I did not feel like six episodes were enough to develop the story. Sometimes dramas don’t find their groove until episode six.

These six episodes delivered a pretty tight, exciting, actionpacked plot - and the action scenes were often great, but would have been greater if I cared more what happened to the characters - and for a zombie show I didn’t feel like the same story line was repeated over and over again, even if good number of the episodes were devoted to fighting or running away from zombies.

The politics of the palace and that whole story line mashed well with the action and the two plot did work quite well together. They did not feel like two completely different stories, which can sometimes happen when you mix genres together. Although most of the time, I enjoyed the politics and the scheming inside the palace more than the stuff that was happening outside the palace.

But because season one only had six episodes there was a lot that needed to be done and set up and I didn’t feel that the characters were getting enough of the time for us to get to know them properly, or develop too much. But we also have not gotten the complete story and in some way it seamed to have just gotten started when it ended. And in a way I feel like I can’t really judge it (too much) before I have seen the second half of this story. But this was the good spin on the zombie story

when i first stumbled across this drama , i thought okay, it's just got to episode 6 ,so i was gonna wait till it's finished then watch but then i found out it is gonna be a multi-seasoned drama in Netflix and i was just so happy because it was way past time for it to happen in k drama world. k drama has talented writers , actors and directors and ... it deserves to be seen with its full potential on display ; yes we make romantic series (which is what a lot of people think when you talk about k drama with them) but we are capable of much more and we've seen it in recent years but i think Kingdom is the first to have more than one season and be presented in Netflix with a theme that compels even the more cynical viewers to give it a shot.
1-opening credits: yeah it doesn't necessarily mean that just because we got a good one , we have a great series . but almost every good show got a good one with an enticing even legendary music that we don't forward because of how good they are...Game Of Thrones, West World , The Expanse, friends, etc. and Kingdom has a really mysterious with a few Easter eggs and a haunting music. 8/10 ( I'm really obsessed with opening scenes)
2- actors : Bae Doona 's name is almost enough to make me give a show a try ,add in Ju Ji-hoon and i'm convinced . i really liked their portrayal of their characters( Bea Doona really nailed the meek almost shy but a hard ass portrayal of the nurse)(i loved her in Sense8 but really her acting is soo good , not even for one second I thought of Sun while watching Kingdom).also i was not familiar with the queen and the minister's actors but i hate them enough to know that they have done a good job . 10/10
3- characters : most important thing to me after story is the characters (i like when shows have a lot of main characters) and their development. let's count ; we have crown prince, the nurse,THE cook(!), evil minister, queen , that other creepy/mysterious- who- looks- good -but- probably -is- not minister , the admirer, the bodyguard(1 season is really soon for me to remember the names)+some good supporting ,supporting characters.it has enough characters so far but i think we can use more point of views in different parts of the country and also different levels of society who one by one will join the action , in future.
the characters have have good enough reasons for their actions so far and it's not hard to understand them even if you look down upon their actions (THE cook comes to mind) . also i know what greed is and how it's a driving force especially in historical dramas and how power fells good but since i don't have any purpose in life, i don't have that much greed i don't understand fully how can people like the minister and queen sleep at night; power ! am I right?(i like my villains with a purpose more than just wanting power and wealth ) . I also like how the prince is not the saint that we see in price protagonists in historical dramas that are royal to a stupid extent to their fathers ; he remind me a little of Rhaegar Targaryen , they both knew their fathers are terrible rulers and wanted to make a move to change it ,be it through a coup or not.
another thing that i enjoyed a LOT was how the governor who fancied Bae Doona transfomed from a scared little shit to a little less scared one who didn't immediately run away when he could.
4-story: it has interesting and mysterious story up until now ,. it's a zombie one so it's a thriller . it's a little too soon to judge it over all.
IT WAS A GOODDRAMA THAT I ENJOYED A LOT.(i need at least 2 seasons for a drama to become my favourite)

I just first want to address the fact that Kingdom is a historical drama if it isn't obvious enough already. Why did I point that out? I've seen a few being turned off with the political aspects of the drama when that is something considered normal in a historical drama. So to those who might be reading this review, make sure you understand that part because you wouldn't enjoy this if you don't like politics in dramas.

Story: This is the first historical zombie drama I have watched (Idk if I can classify GoT as one lol) and the whole zombie plot was unique to me. I could give this a 10 out 10 but it still felt lacking in terms of the story of the characters. It will probably be expound on the next season but since I'm only rating for this one, I'll give it a 9.5.
For the politics, it's a scenario I've seen in many historical dramas before but it's surprisingly well-executed here, so i'm not gonna criticize no matter how common of a plot it is. There was parts of the politics that were fairly new to me so it wasn't completely predictable.

Acting/Cast: The acting were great for both the alive and the dead characters lol. There were some humor thrown from here and there and it sometimes come out as awkward so i couldn't really rate it a perfect 10. I guess that's like a signature moment in kdramas but I think it would be better if they just create an entire serious atmosphere throughout.

Music: Not much about the music since it didn't have the famous osts we know but I rated it a 10 for the fact that it sounded like a GoT intro lol

Rewatch value: Would definitely rewatch this again once season 2 is about to come out

Extremely simple idea with extremely high production value.

First, I like to warn anyone who might want to pick it up - it's graphic. If you have a weak stomach, move it straight to the ""not interested"" list. They delivered amazing, beautiful, but gruesome pictures that made me uncomfortable with the content, but also in awe with how beautifully shot they were. No doubt the production value was the best part of the drama. It's clear to me a lot of thought was put into directing and editing, as well as set and costume design. The zombies... ladies and gentlemen... These were some good zombies. I was extremely impressed by the actors portraying them. The movement they presented was true perfection.

The acting was amazing for some, good for others. At times it was hard to judge since some characters (The Queen B) were annoyingly boring and unnecessary. Overall: A+. Especially with such a large ""supporting cast"" of all the background people and zombies. At times, dramas cast average skilled people for these roles, with hopes no one will notice. Here, everyone did their part well.

As for the plot and characters. There truly is not that much to say. It's the old tale we all know: power struggle and fighting for the crown. There is nothing new nor innovative about it. That said, since it's executed so well, it was not boring. Not to mention the zombie apocalypse going on in the background to keep us invested and excited. I was a bit disappointed with how they slowly toned down the shocking scenes to just go with zombies running and killing, since the creepy scenes from the beginning were some of the most memorable scenes.

There were some characters I loved more (Young Shin and Master Ahn Hyung), and some that seemed pointless and not interesting at all (Jo Bum Pal and the Queen) but knowing it's just a first season, I'm hopeful they will deliver more later.

Was I disappointed in anything? Yes. Last episode presented two plot twists that were simply dumb in my eyes, and the longer I think about them, the less sense I see in what was shown. One of them makes a character look too stupid for the position they hold, and the other, to some extent, contradicts everything that happened before it.

Can you watch it as a stand alone without diving into season two? Technically, yes, but it would not be a smart idea. Season one ends on a cliffhanger and more or less middle part of the whole plot (if not just the introduction).

I don’t usually watch zombie films and shows because I feel like every plot is the same and widely overdone, but I gave this show look because I’ve seen many of the actors and actresses from previous kdramas. Man did I make the right choice. The production, cinematography, and storyline of this series is absolutely fantastic. Every episode will keep you at the edge of your seat. You won’t know who’s going to die, or who lives, everything is completely unexpected and that’s what I love. The story is original too.

In the first season we got a massive cliffhanger and found out the temperature is what’s keeping these zombie killing machines going. Having to wait another full year for s2, oh boy, we’re thrown for a loop and given once again ANOTHER cliffhanger at the end, discovering someone was actually selling a supply of the same flowers we find out where behind the zombie pandemic. This person, who was teased in being the “possible” seller happens to be one of my favorite Korean actresses and uuu boi was I screaming.

Overall, the pace of this show is amazing, nothing is hard to follow, every character has a part to play in the plot, and the actors and actresses who played them were amazing. Even if your not into zombie related shows or films I’d recommend giving this show watch solemnly on the plot and acting alone. It definitely won’t be waste of your time. Give it a watch.

Mostly on the screen appear shambles and slaughter.
It’s a kind of concept. The more slaughter and dead body - the better.

I don’t think that the story is addictive and interesting. It’s rather simple and uninspired. The characters are flat. It’s difficult to bond with anyone here.

But it’s watchable because of Joo Ji Hoon. His performance is brilliant! I like his prince who in the beginning of the story is confused and uncertain, but later, after some battles with zombies, becomes a true lead. The other acting is just okay. Nothing special. Definitely it’s too short (6 ep.) to develop plots and characters.
I don’t like the music. It would seem that especially music would create the dark mood and fear in the zombies world, but no. Not in this case.

If you don’t like a story that stopped and doesn’t run anywhere, do not watch it and wait for the next season.
Maybe the next season will be better, who knows.

I decided to watch this show not because I particularly enjoy zombie stories...though the fact that it was set in the Joseon era did pique my interest. However, what truly made me decide to watch it is...and now I'm a little ashamed of myself...Joon Ji Hoon. That's right. I love his acting so much that I've vowed to myself that I'd watch all of his works (except Goong, I haven't been able to bring myself to finish it).

So, that's how I picked up Kingdom and I must say...boy am I happy I did it. This show is EPIC. It's the most incredible sageuk I've seen in a long time. I loved EVERYTHING about it. The story, the production, the special effects, the brilliant acting, the cinematography. So, if you're pondering whether to watch this or not, my only advice would be DO IT!! WATCH IT NOW!! IT'S AMAZING!! Seriously, I'm sure you won't regret it. Besides, thankfully season 2 is out already on Netflix so I can binge watch it till dawn *insert evil laugh here*

So yeah, go watch Kingdom now!!

From now on only Korea is allowed to make zombie movies and series. I said what I said. (Lol please don't take it too seriously!)
This show has received a lot of amazing reviews and attention from audiences that aren't typically asian drama watchers and that only proves this show's ability to surpass language and cultural barriers and capture everyone's hearts and keep us at the edge of our seats.
There are many amazing reviews already that express my feelings perfectly but I'll still say a few words for each category, in case whoever is reading this still isn't convinced.

The plot is absolutely AMAZING, BRILLIANT, EXCITING, GENIUS etc etc. It really doesn't get any better than this. The whole story is so intriguing, heartbreaking and incredibly cruel, as it portrays the biggest flaws of humanity. The writer and everyone involved in the production of the series did an incredible job at criticising our day's society through 1) a story about an epidemy that transforms people into flesh-craving monsters 2) set in the Joseon era, centuries before our present time. It's truly outstanding.

The cast is simply brilliant. I believed every actor, every emotion, every expression. I'm ashamed of not knowing these fantastic actors before this drama. I have to check their other works out!
The characters were so complex and raw that I found myself submerged in the story and living their adventures as if I was their companion. That's how realistic they were. Forget about all the stereotypes surrounding heroes and nation saviours: these people are trying to survive, not always in the most selfless way. I loved every single one of them. The fact that the Crown Prince is genuinely doing his best and beyond to help those people and be different from the selfish and coward ""important"" people is remarkable. I loved his character development; it might seem very small and irrelevant compared to the magnitude of the events, however, he is the one who has the power to save them all. The ""small changes"" in his character by the end of the season were so meaningful and completely relevant to the plot. I don't think there are any side characters as they all play very important roles and they're all PHENOMENAL, whether I loved them or hated them.

The music increased the tense sensation on my stomach and made me literally jump sometimes. It was so well chosen that I can't give it less than 10 stars.

The more I think about this drama, the more I love it and watch to rewatch it. I'm so glad I chose to give it a chance and I certainly don't regret it. I'll probably rewatch it before the new season stars... that's how obsessed I am!

I'm not a horror fan and I'm still scared of historical dramas thanks to my lack of knowledge and experience with these shows, but Kingdom was able to make my mind work at an incredible speed for two days and every time that I wasn't watching it I was thinking about watching it. Powerful show, in many ways. It deserves the 10 stars and I will happily add it to my favorites list.

Overall I loved this series. I watched it in the span of 3 days and now I can't wait for a season 2!

Story
The story was in my opinion very unique and not stretched out to the max, like a lot of kdramas are unfortunately. I could best describe this series as a mix between The Walking Dead and Train to Busan, but set in Joseon Korea. The story contains a lot of gore, just like TWD, and focuses on the struggles of the weak vs. the powerful and a crown prince who wants to fight for his people. What I mainly liked about the story is how comprehandable it was. What I usually dislike about Sageuk dramas is how overly complicted the political aspect of the story can be (at least to me). Furthermore, their wasn't any cringey romance anywhere to be seen (which is also unique for a Sageuk, at least the one's I've seen). However, Kingdom had this good balance of political struggles (legitamacy as a king, poverty and dealing with the disease which turns people in to zombies) paired with bloody action scenes and, on the other hand, light moments where beautiful nature is shown and sometimes a bit of romance.
The only thing I kind of missed in the series was more backstory and depth regarding the characters. There are some flashbacks, which make you feel a bit more attached to the main characters, but unfortunately the characters were quite flat and I hope to see this change in a season 2. (However, in the defense of the series: I think 6 episodes would have been to short to give an in depth story on every main character, so for this season I think it was a good decision to build up the story and hopefully a second season will elaborate more on the characters, and even some romance). Also, the reason I keep talking about a season 2 is because I feel like the story simply hasn't ended and it has so much more to offer, so it would be weird for there to not be a season 2 looking at how the series ended..

Acting/Cast
Overall I liked the cast and their acting. To be honest I never really pay attention to acting or notice it a lot unless it's cringingly bad. Also, except for Heo Junho (who's a great actor), I can't remember seeing any other cast members in other series/films, so I don't really feel like I can fully judge the actors yet, but as for now I think they were great.

Music
Music is also something I don't notice unless I find it very bad or unfitting, but in Kingdom that's not the case. There weren't any really memorable songs/osts because it's all instrumental as far as I remember. However, the director has made perfect use of music to build tension to keep you at the edge of your seat.

Rewatch Value
I'm not the type to rewatch series, but since this drama is so short and easily accesible through Netflix, I can actually see myself rewatching the series and that's why I scored it an 8.

Overall
I definitely recommend this drama to everyone who loves Sageuk and zombies/gore. The story is very short, but very interesting nonetheless. The acting and music was great overall and, though I didn't discuss it in depth, I loved the way it was filmed and the locations, like Changdeokgung Palace and Huwon/Biwon (the palace's so called 'secret garden' which can be seen in the trailer), were stunning. The only thing I think could have been better was the character depth, or actually the lack of it. Therefore I give this series an overall rating of 9 instead of a 10.

I have been anticipating this one for over a year and bless Train To Busan putting the zombie-genre on Korea's map! This concept is literally so fresh, and I am surprised it hasn't been done so much before, because it is so smart putting zombie virus as a form of plague during times of actual plague and poverty. This drama really is stunning and worth the budget being sky-high, the camerawork, costumes and effects are amazing and money well-spent.

The plot meshes zombie apocalypse with intriguing court politics in just the right way, and you think it is gonna get dragged out but instead the last episode just leaves you wanting for more. Also plots and characters that are getting more and more developed in the right pace, because they don't have time for emotions, they just gotta run as fast as they can. I also like having the Crown Prince as a center character, being from the highest class, while some of the real heroes of the story are the ones from the lower classes, like Seobi, the guard and the mysterious tigerhunger really doing the most.

I am so excited for the next chapter, and especially with the undead capable of being out and about in the day now.

This series is far from the deepest series out there and it's definitely more of a blockbuster type film, however the premise is quite cool and as far as disaster films and zombie films go this is quite a good one as well as a fun watch.

My only complaint would be at times the show does feel like it's dragging, however the scenes with the zombies as well as the delicious plot twists more than make up for that, I'd say this is great for fans of the zombie genre ass well as people looking for something fun to watch

This is a little tough to rate, as I'm watching it after the second season has come out so I'm hoping that they flesh it out a bit. I'm glad I didn't watch this when it originally came out because otherwise I might have been frustrated and not really invested in waiting for the second season.

This first season feels like a lot of set-up. That's necessary, of course, but the show still felt somewhat incomplete. There is a real lack of emphasis on the characters, so you're not really invested in them other than the fact that they're living beings on the screen. There's very little conversation or banter that gives you any kind of hint as to their personalities. None of the relationships are really developed either. It was also odd that it felt like a good portion of the action happened off-screen. For example, when the beginning of the outbreak starts, two characters are in a shed arguing. You see blood spill into the shed, but the only thing you really see about what happened that night is the aftermath, with blood everywhere and stakes and sharp bamboo sticks constructed as barriers. This sort of thing happened with a couple of zombie encounters, where the entire situation mostly happened off-screen. I don't mean to say that all zombie attacks have to occur on screen, but it was odd that seemingly big ones weren't really shown.

I was a little confused about how rushed certain plot points were (the politics in the beginning are a bit fast and might be hard to catch onto), while it seemed to also be taking its sweet time in other parts (plenty of long shots of people riding places, walking in the palace, etc.). I will say that the action sequences and zombie parts of the show are really good. There is so much tension surrounding the zombie threat, as our heroes attempt to get people to take it seriously and yet are not listened to. When night falls, they know (and we know too) that they're doomed. The zombies themselves are terrifying. Their clouded eyes, the strange strangled growls they make, the way they move their bodies as they rise from the ground are all so disturbing. Kudos to those actors for giving it 100%. Basically, everything about the zombies is great, both the sequences that involve them as well as people's reactions and plans to handle them, and fortunately that's a good portion of the show, so the show is definitely good, despite the fact that I'm mostly complaining about it in this review.

The aspect of the show that is most developed is the political situation, which to me is the most boring part of many sageuks. It's more interesting here because of the very unique situation that they are reacting to. I hope that with the political situation set up they can not focus as much on it in season 2. As I said, there's so much action and plot-related things happening that the characters are very paper-thin, but I think they show promise and I hope in season 2 they get more time to get fleshed out. I think the twists that happen at the end are good and intriguing, but honestly if I had watched this show when it first came out I don't know how invested I would've been in a second season. I'm glad there's a second season, as now I can see whether they follow up on the good stuff they set up.

Such a fun reimagining of the zombie genre! I love the idea of setting a zombie apocalypse (of a sort) in a historical period because it increases the sense of unknowable and unimaginable horror. There are no medical or scientific explanations available to break down what is happening, and it can't be summarized by the characters as a viral epidemic, etc. I'm not saying those types of zombie movies don't have their own strengths, but I really enjoyed seeing the historical Korean monarchy paired with zombies, it was scary in a way I hadn't been expecting.

The cast is great. I don't think that the acting is necessarily the biggest draw here (Historical. Zombies.) but I think that they do a good job of making you care about the people involved. Of course, Bae Doona is her usual awesome self.

The writing and directing is very good, keeping a breakneck pace while also keeping the stakes digestible enough that it feels personal. The survival of this specific group of people is the focus of the first season, which gives room for the scope to be expanded in season two. I think that the twist is very well done, the zombies are well done (their strengths and limitations are well matched to the show, they're not TOO powerful and do have some weaknesses, but they also very much feel like a threat).

Overall, a well-made and enjoyable horror tv show that will be entertaining for people that like gore, action, some horror and also a solid historical setting. Definitely worth checking out. It may sound gimmicky to pair zombies and period dramas (some Pride and Prejudice and Zombies type shit), but actual I think that the setting is used really smartly to actual increase tension and horror, while still feeling like it's speaking to modern issues.

Likes: Zombies. Joo Ji Hoon wielding a sword. The awesome action scenes.

Dislikes: S1 is too short!! Only 6 eps. Plus there’s a ginormous cliff hanger which you’ll have to wait until S2 to find out what happens!

I do confess, I’m a zombie fan. I dunno why. Maybe it’s the whole going back to basics bit…the simple need to survive. Or maybe it’s the more clear cut good vs evil. Or the fact that I’m usually at the edge of my seat when I’m watching a battle with the zombies. I dunno…I just love it. From 28 Days Later to the Walking Dead to Train to Busan and everything in between, I just can’t get enough.

The thing I like about Korean zombies is they’re FAST compared to American zombies. Just like in Train to Busan, there were so many scenes where I didn’t realize I was holding my breath until the scene was over and I could sigh with relief. The scenes were shot well. The editing was great. The cast can act. Everything just came together beautifully.

It was really hard rating this drama. It was highly anticipated as a Netflix original Korean series and after watching the trailer I could see that the budget was high. To tell the truth I wanted this series to be a hit. Why? I wanted people who don't give a chance to series from countries like China and Korea to know what they are missing.

I read multiple comments saying that the series had more politics than it should have and I completely understand their point of view, but I also disagree. I think that the drama didn't want to be just a source of entertainment. In my opinion the writers wanted us to see that even in a life-or-death situation, the politicians - no matter being in the Joseon era or in today's society - will only think about their own personal gain. But if there are no people to ''obey'' does having power really matter? It was great to think who are the real monsters and see in what extremes can people go to survive. I loved the fact that it showed the corruption among the people in the palace and the courage of every day individuals.

What made this different from all the dystopian films and series was the fact that it didn't only have dramatic scenes but it also had comedic elements. The cinematography was great, so was the music. The only minor problem for me was the acting. Don't get me wrong it wasn't even near to being bad, but I expected more from such well known actors - also more screen time for Bae Doona-.

All in all, it is definitely worth watching and I would recommend it to non Kdrama watchers for sure.

BEST ZOMBIE SERIES OUT THERE!
~One of the most thrilling zombie fantasy genre drama with a touch of historical fiction
~It is pretty fast-paced and keeps you on the edge of the seat in anticipation and fear
~Three dimensional characters make it interesting for the plot and storylines
~Touches upon political and social commentaries on the hunger for power, class inequalities, bureaucratric hierarchies and poverty
~Solid A class cinematography and picturization
~Not for the faint hearted though as it can be graphic and gory at times

A creepy & entertaining mix of ""Game of Thrones"" & a typical Korean historical drama
""Kingdom"" is basically ""Game of Thrones"" if ""Game of Thrones"" was trimmed down of its numerous subplots and just concentrated on a storyline with one obvious protagonist that came out of the ""Lord of the Rings"" playbook. Like look:There's a political squabble (with lots of underhanded, dirty political manoeuvres) happening in the capital. There's an evil queen. There's the evil queen's evil dad who controls the evil queen. The king is under the evil guys' control. Cold-loving zombies advance from the north. A male protagonist tries to fight both the undead and the corrupt. Ultra-realistic settings and cinematography ensues.

It really borrows a lot of ""GoT"". But ""Kingdom"" still feels very much like its own thing. The plotpoints might've been borrowed, the cinematography might've been influenced by the realistic epic fantasy look ""GoT"" popularized (as opposed to the ""Lord of the Rings"" look or the wuxia look), you can trace and smell the influence of ""GoT"" in it, but ""Kingdom"" fills the cracks between the things it borrowed and makes the whole thing feel new.

The protagonist is flawed and has a great subtle character arc. There's a nice way the series builds tension. The makeup and CGI effects are quite good (it's Netflix, of course they have budget). The acting is great. The production design has punch to it. Some editing and framing choices were exciting. And yeah, the political subtext embued in the zombie narrative is really smart, it doesnt feel cliched.

I have things I didnt really like. I felt like some characters felt a lot more one-note than others, particularly the female healer and that other town chieftain guy. The music was quite generic. There were plotpoints integral to the plot that just felt dumb if you thought about them (just like, wouldn't a cover up about the king's state of well-being be a lot more easier and effective than having the king get ""turned""? Like, it's just the same). There's also some serious plot armor shit going on, and I don't really buy some of the comedic relief.

But the show is unsettling sometimes. It intrigues. It entertains. It can be quite immersive. I just hope it can maintain it in its second season.

High octane block buster action and gore !
The Korean film industry really knows how to handle the Zombie genre . Period .

There’s not much to say about Kingdom S1 as it’s 6 eps but what I can say is that it is exciting , binge worthy and very dynamic in the violence and gore department!

Character portraits are not profound but Kingdom does not present itself like that. It’s high octane blockbuster action and gore and it scores high points in those aspects ! Job well done .

A must watch for lovers of the zombie genre !

My first dive into Korean zombies
I'm normally not one to watch anything related to zombies, mostly because it's usually the same thing over and over. When I first heard about this drama, it piqued my interest. Mainly because I love K-dramas and historical K-Dramas. No other zombie show or movie I've seen has done this. Usually all western zombie shows and movies are done in the present day, whereas this one is in ancient times technology hasn't advanced, there's less guns, and it makes me wonder what a period zombie show would be like.

The characters are interesting. I don't know who to trust or who's good and who isn't. The Crown Prince is someone who I fear for. I always worry he's gonna die if not at the hands of the zombies, then at the hands of the Cho clan. He's trying to do the right thing while keeping himself and the people alive. While I don't agree with certain things he's done, he's still trying to stay alive.

I also like the zombie origin in this: they come back to life from the essence of a plant. It's different from usual zombie origins.

South Korea does not play around with zombies. I've learned that from seeing Kingdom and other Korean films about zombies.

All in all, this is a great show and I can't wait for the next season.

A surprising take on period dramas
Kingdom is a mini series set during the Joseon period with a sudden outbreak of flesh eating arisen dead. The series is slow placed but doesn’t leave you feeling like there’s not much happening. It’s almost emotions driven because you feel the nervousness and fear that the characters feel. in this first season we are given a proper introduction to the zombies and their habits while also getting accustomed to the characters. The series ends on a cliffhanger, I’m glad I watched it only after the second season was out. There are some aspects of the plot that feel slightly weak, but it’s all right. I also liked the cinematography, the focus on the vastness of the palace which isn’t usually this visible in the rest of the period dramas. And also the disparity and suffering between the rich and the poor told visually was stunning.

Overall it’s a good thriller with lots of goriness and killing and some zombie apocalypse setting. Totally bingeworthy!

No doubt, this is one of the best dramas
The first time I watched this drama, I was really in awe with the plot itself. I always thought of a lot of questions after completing the first season like if it was really the Doctor who discovered the flower, where did the flower come from, what makes the dead into zombies, after putting the flower in the glabella of the deceased. I also think that that the situation portrayed in the beginning of the drama could be very much true in which the Queen and her family, who were so greedy with power would do whatever it took so they can have the kingdom in their hands. It speaks of politics, which apparently, has never changed. The situation of the people really got to me, because even now, despite a country being developed and all, there are still that portion of the population experiencing difficulties.
All in all, watching the drama was such a roller coaster of emotions. You may think you understand everything already but then another thing gets revealed and then you question yourself, if you really paid enough attention to the details of the drama. I also think that the details were very much intricate and well-planned. There are so many things that you could miss if you are not attentive enough, so I don’t recommend dividing your attention while watching this drama. It’s a drama for people who like watching dramas with horror, mystery and suspense, especially those who like watching out for the little details and connecting the dots.

I heard a lot of praise about this drama so one day I just randomly decided to watch despite that I can't watch horror.

This drama turned out to be really great and worth all the hype. The fast zombies were definitely scary and I have to praise the make-up and costume team for doing such a great job with these. I'm a bit sad that there were only two major female roles in the drama (Seo Bi and the Queen). I know that it's a historical but still I would like to see more women in the drama.

Overall my rating for the first season is 8.5/10.

a kdrama for non-kdrama watchers
i am very new to kdramas and asian dramas in general. my biggest struggle is a lot of dramas i have seen had either slow pacing or episodes that were almost 1 hour and a half ( a whole movie ).

kingdom is a series that took me twenty minutes to like and 1 episode to love. while short in length (40 min episodes and 6 episodes per season), the story telling is not compromised, in fact this has one of the most intriguing and enticing stories I have seen in a long time (not to mention good female characters !!).

some of the shots in this series gave me actual chills combined with the amazing ost. the acting is amazing.

honestly in love with this series already (i have only just finished season 1) and i feel so strongly about this series that this is my first review.

Zombie like apocalypse plus political drama
Production superb. Story wise, fresh take on the zombie apocalypse theme. Acting's really really good. Even the visuals are gruesome in a good way.

Zombie like apocalypse plus political drama.

The crowned prince fighting for his rights as the rightful ruler and fighting the undead. He's admirable even from the start. He's search for the truth, how brave he was from start to end. His resolve to protect the weak. His loyalty to the nation and his friends. He courage to do what's right, killing his own father, taking in a brother who's not even his blood, and even giving up the crown.

The paranormal component of the show was made as realistic as possible. A plant that could give life to the dead and dying, turns out to be a parasitic issue. So all good..

Korea just seems to knock-it-out-the-park when it comes to zombies
Kingdom was one of the first kdramas I watched, it popped up on my Netflix suggestions and I was not disappointed!

The season was short, but I think this worked in its favour, any longer and it may have dragged out. The acting was brilliant, even from side characters and the zombies themselves. The show really did well at just showing the absolute panic there would be if an outbreak like this started, and this isn't modern-day but the Joseon period so no semi-automatics to save yourself when a hoard is coming.

The twist and turns really added to the suspense, you really feel like you are piecing the story together with the characters and the twist at the end had me shook!

I would recommend this show to anyone that loves the zombie genre and I would definitely rewatch it.

I absolutely love zombie related shows, I can never get enough of them. I always say to myself Korea makes the best zombie dramas and movies, for some reason I haven't found one I've disliked so far. It's always
hard to find a decent one I like, nothing ever catches my attention but some how the Korean market produces them, they are just top quality.

PLOT/STORY
This gives me 'I am legend' vibes with how the zombie like creatures can't come out in day light, something similar to that. I love the concept of the zombies coming out at a certain time, it's very unique and like I've said, I've only seen this idea once before.

I also love how they jump to different stories throughout the episodes. Like one story we have the crown prince fighting off the zombies and protecting his people and land, while over here we have the Queen is pretending to be pregnant to full everyone into thinking she is. The stories are all over the place but I'm loving how it was put together, it made me very intrigued on what's going to happen next to both parties that are involved.

ACTING/CAST
The casting choice was amazing, I went in blind not knowing who any of these actors or actresses were but wow. You can watch me check out other things they've been in. Everyone is perfect for their roles; and after watching I couldn't see anyone else playing these characters apart from them.

It was so hard to pick a favorite character, they all shined in their own ways. But if I had to pick a character as a favorite it would be the crown prince, not because he is the main character but because he shows loyalty to his people while being prosecuted as this 'traitor'. I just loved this about him, it just shows his true colours.

OVERALL
I'd definitely rewatch, with only 6 episodes (wish there was more) it's an easy and fast drama to watch. I have a short attention span especially watching dramas, but this one never lost my interest. From the first episode all the way to the last episode my full attention was on this drama (which is rare for me). I highly recommend watching for an great experience, you won't be disappointed.

4K

i seldomn ever (actually.. ever) call something perfect, but this is straight up perfect. when the only flaw is that i wish it wouldn't stop, what else would you call that?

tight and concise as can be, 6 episodes polished to a glow, on real 4k. no time is wasted setting anything up, yet all the info we require, we get. the bulk is done through incredible visual storytelling, adding emphasis to every spoken word all the more. the peak of everything korean media has to offer from film to tv boiled down into a flawless package. bae doona & ju hi-hoon rly in the lead, and my man kim sang-ho carrying the support with sung-kyu. my interest for period piece drama is beyond the scale rn.

i hope this'll open the doors for a new parallel netflix kdrama evolution, with more freedoms to do stuff regular ones cant, like the gore here. maybe even embrace of the season format. truly epic event TV.

I don't even know where I should start praising.

Well, first of all the combination of zombies and Joseon dynasty was definitely worth while. Haven't seen that kind of drama before and also don't know of anything like this. They integrated your usual sageuk theme quite well into the zombie genre.

You can see that they had a high budget on this and it paid off. Of course, there's also the ""Netflix""-touch (or let's call it the Western touch) to it. Scenes/editing/cinematography feel different. I mean, really good sageuks have this certain serious aura. This one as well, but it's still different. And yet, it maintains its historical Korean core: the conflict between politicians and the Royal family.

Do you know what's really satisfying in this drama? Whenever you get annoyed by corrupt characters in a sageuk, you'd almost pull out all of your hair, you want to punish them yourself and it takes an eternity until they get what they really deserve. But here you don't get bothered at all because you just know that there's a higher/stronger instance that doesn't care for Joseon politics and that defines a new order. Its pure existance threatens the whole system whether it's noblemen or peasants. And no one can escape.

The cast in this is simply amazing. I wouldn't expect less either. Here are stellar actors and actresses assembled, each of them doing a fantastic job. Maybe it's the editing but it feels like a whole new level... or a different level. It's hard to describe.

The only character I couldn't become comfortable with was the queen. I don't really think that the actress was the right choice for this. She was the weakest part of them all even though the character itself is actually quite important. She never warmed up to me. That's my only complaint about this.

This series breathed new life into the tired old zombie genre. The opening sequence with the methodical resurrection of the king hooked me in. It was beautiful in a ghastly sort of way.

South Korean shows are becoming good at taking old ideas, putting their own twist on it, and executing it perfectly. Being set in the distant Joseon period, the crew had to make sure everything from the costumes, the sets, to the props, all go together to create a sense of realism. It felt as if we were right inside that world. They were not afraid to make their actors look dirty, tired, and unattractive. Even the extras were done right, down to the zombie makeup and creepy jerky movements. The production value was sky high with hordes of zombies, bloody battle scenes, and even an undead ship. It was on par with Hollywood, and even better at times.

The acting was on point, nothing over-the-top or melodramatic. Ju Ji Hoon gave a very restrained, believable performance as an initially clueless prince who was learning to care about his kingdom and people. Jeon Seok Ho’s cowardly nobleman was not just a comic relief. You get a sense that he was on his way to redeem himself somehow. Heo Joon Ho as Lord Ahn was just cool without even trying. The show slowly built the characters so that you care about them, instead of just killing them off randomly for the shock value.

It was smart of them to leave out the romance. The plot had to enough substance to stand on its own. It didn’t need to be bogged down with a love story or worse yet, a love triangle. But what sets this series apart was how they used the plague to point out the social inequality that existed then, and still exists now. That was more scary than the zombies.

Horror and gore, but genius plot!
Kingdom

A gore and shockingly scary series where some scenes left me in horror! Could not watch some scenes, but the political and environmental and historical elements did it for me. The shock of the first zombie scenes were exciting to watch, but after a while it was just too much for me. I love the main characters, and them working together. The villains were for real! The actors were amazing. Genius plot, and interesting background of the zombies that makes you want to watch more! I’m am still eagerly waiting for a third season.

I did not remember the music, even though I have rewatched this drama several times. This tells enough of what my mind thinks of the music, it was average. Background music often suspenseful.

Basically, overall the series made me want more! Especially now that a new actress will join the cast hopefully in a third season, from Ashin of the North. I say this is one of the best “zombie”- series I have ever watched, the best part is that the zombies were not the main part of the story, there were many different elements to it. And everything was connected and put together so well. Even the background of all the characters and when and how they would meet and continue the story was perfectly put together, it made sense. It is not a romance focused drama, more about politics, power, the different positions and groups in a society back then, and a zombie virus with an riveting origin and background. Still after two seasons, my curiosity is still not satisfied and I can not wait until further revelations come. I am most excited about what will happen when the actress from Ahsin of the North comes. This drama left me with many speculations and expectations and hopes that need to be fulfilled.

Great Zombie drama
I watched Kingdom at the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic, watching a story of a very contagious illness is pretty unnerving at the beginning of a pandemic while things are uncertain.

I'm not normally into zombie dramas but I decided to give Kingdom a go because I heard good things. I enjoyed that part of the drama was working out how the zombie plague started as well as the drama of royal succession in ancient Korea. Kingdom is action filled and kept my on the edge of my seat while also having an interesting story line.

The acting seemed really good but unfortunately I watched Kingdom with the actor's voices dubbed, I found this really distracting but now I know next time I can change the settings. I thought the main actor was very handsome too. The ending gave a hint of a new season coming so I'd definitely be watching the new season if it comes out. I don't remember the music.

Alt-History Joseon-Zombie Masterpiece
KINGDOM was brilliant and in my humble opinion, vastly superior to many of the other zombie series out there today. It's certainly one of a kind, a new breed. It was only enhanced by the Joseon historical setting and alternative history presented by the directors. It was excellently written, casted, directed and acted. Great production and cinematography. Beautiful settings, lifelike costumes and realistic storylines. Epic battle scenes and zombie costume/cosmetics. Dark, gritty and cutting edge series.

I really loved the cast, especially Ju Ji-hoon as Crown Prince, and Bae Doona as the nurse Seo Bi. I also really enjoyed the character of Kim Sang Ho, as the bodyguard Moo Young. His character was extremely likable and I loved the dynamic between he and the Crown Prince. Kim Sungkyu, as Young Shin (the Tiger Hunter) was a very compelling character as well, playing a mysterious warrior with a shadowy past.

Ju Ji-hoon is excellent in this series. His portrayal of the tragic Crown Prince character is really note-worthy and he plays the noble hero turned warrior very memorably. It's great to see his character grow and conquer new obstacles, and become a person worthy to inherit the throne.

One of my main critiques is this. As a big fan of actress Bae Doona (Stranger), I did feel like her true potential wasn't being utilized in this series, but that seems mostly due to the direction and writing of this series, rather than any issue on her part. I truly hope to see her character allowed grow and shine in future installments as she is a wonderful, diverse actress with a lot of acting range.

This series brought so much to the zombie table, so to speak. I found the ""truth"" behind the plague to be fascinating and unique. It was a truly intriguing twist. Also, this series does not shy away from highlighting both the good and evils of humanity, offering a glimpse at human nature and morality. It was a truly stunning show. I've now watched the complete Kingdom series and am hoping for further seasons in the future. This was a great new addition to the kdrama thriller and horror genres.

[This review is for seasons 1 & 2]

Simply the Best
Zombie apocalypse in ancient Korea. Sounds absurd, right? Yet another, stupid zombie movie, right? No such thing! This drama has a well thought-out, smart plot - if not for the paranormal aspect, it would be totally plausible. Add to this great cast, interesting characters, who you really don't want to be eaten by the zombies, ;) power struggle, political schemes, and captivating cinematography... Well, I really cannot imagine a drama better than this one. Strongly recommended.

Woah. This drama was so good, I just had to write my first review on it.

The plot of a zombie outbreak is common amongst particularly Western film today. One could even say the genre is overdone. However, the way that 'Kingdom' handles the issue is a breath of fresh air. It would be enough that it happens to occur in old-time Korea, because that in itself already felt brand new.
But the twist of an infected King made it that much more interesting, with the addition of a power struggle between a pregnant queen and a crown prince.

The Crown Prince, Lee Chang, has interesting growth throughout the series. At first he is portrayed as a sheltered, somewhat arrogant character that is journeying for himself, to uncover the mystery surrounding his father. However, he grows quite quickly and the watcher no longer doubts him. He shows compassion and a strong sense of justice, and soon becomes quite the potential King. I enjoyed his actor of course, but there is one other than impressed me so much more.

Seo Bi is introduced as an assistant physician. Throughout the series, her empathy matches her profession, and she proves herself to be smarter than the average citizen, therefore surviving despite being put through some very scary situations. This was the first time I was introduced to her actress, Bae Doo Na, and honestly? For myself personally, her acting was almost flawless. I absolutely fell in love with her as an actress. Because of her work in Kingdom, I definitely plan to watch more of her roles.

The final character I want to discuss is the Queen. She does an excellent job as an antagonist, and her actions frustrated and irritated me (which is what I expect from a good antagonist). One thing I appreciated about her was that, whilst you were furious at her, and you knew that she would make a cruel ruler, you understood her thinking at the very least. Her motives were clear, and human, although they were somewhat evil.

As for the rewatch value; although it was incredibly stressful to watch and therefore not something I would rewatch for a little while (at least until I recover), due to how short but sweet the first season has been it would not be at all difficult to rewatch when the time comes.

Overall, despite being new to Drama, I could tell that this drama was very well done. It was so realistic, every frame was done well and it was clearly a high budget series. I was quickly immersed in a world of night-monsters and political balances, and I definitely can't wait for a second season.

Re-watch and still like it
I just finished re-watch this series, I still find it interesting. I am not really a fans of zombie movies, so not sure about the standard of the sole zombie lover's movie. And I haven't read the original webtoon either. Overall the production done a good job. I like how they shoot some scenes, nice camera angle.

My opinion
Story : Good story, there's story behind, not only solely a hunt and catch zombie type of movie, but also politics, power struggle and humanity. The story flow is well paced, able to catch audience attention.

Acting: Good acting from all the cast

Music : Suitable for this kind of genre, but not to my liking LOL

OMG, do South Koreans know how to do zombie movies !! Be prepared, cause the only fault I find with this series is the fact that it’s Netflix’s style, so split into seasons. I like very much about Asian dramas the fact that they don’t drag in seasons.

Kingdom season 1 is a strong one. Of course, a bit of social commentary is there; poor people are most affected, rich guys are safe. Enter the Crown Prince, a friend to the people, trying his best to save them. He does know some very important lessons – you cannot save all, his decisions will bring peace or war, betrayal is at every step and do not hesitate to use your power.

Story is smooth, perfect pacing, a lot of action, people who you wouldn’t expect to die, do die, cause they’re only humans (alive or dead already). Depravity and evilness of humans is at every step – again a commentary regarding who is the real monster. I enjoyed the political fights – power is a great drug and it’s almost impossible to give it up when you’re high on it. So all kind of monsters appear.

Acting… wow. I don’t think there is an interpretation I don’t like. All characters are real people for me, nothing is forced. Awesome performances, perhaps the best I’ve ever seen. This is the kind of series in which all characters are powerful, thanks to more factors – script, directing, the actors. I cannot chose a favorite… maybe Bae Doo Na is a notch above the rest.

If you are a fan of zombie/horror genre…do not wait! Free yourself a day, watch these 2 seasons and your top of zombie movies will change.

I cannot quite compare it with The Walking Dead and Fear of the Walking Dead. I dropped The Walking Dead at season 2 initially. I tried a few years later again – nope. Watched season 1 of Fear of the Walking Dead… so boring… So if you liked these 2, be careful – Kingdom has a lot of action. Yeah, I know Kingdom is shorter. That doesn’t make it less good. I would rather rewatch Kingdom 100 times, than suffer through WD seasons.

Besides, Kingdom is the one that feels more real… Isolation worked, right ??

This whole series is just mindblowing. The drama is very complex with a lot of plots intertwined with each other. It is complex but can be very subtle as well. I find myself having to repeat some of the episodes to figure out all the hints. But it worth to rewatch and you won't get bored.

First, let's talk about the casts. I'm actually happy that Joo Ji Hoon is playing the crown prince. There was a talk about Song Jong Ki being cast for the role, but he rejected it. I'm not saying that Jong Ki is not a good actor, but Joo Ji Hoon has more experiences playing complex characters and I find his image is more suitable with the drama. Also, good job for the team to cast experienced actor and actresses like Bae Do Na and Ryu Seung Ryong.

Second the plots. It is based on a web manwha but it took a completely different setting and story but still keep the basic idea. The conflict started when the Cho clan was taking control of the power. The king was ill and it was still a mystery about how he became a monster. Was it because of the mysterious illness that he had or was it because he was resurrected with the resurrection plant? He definitely became an undead brainless monster who ate human. The prime minister Cho, who was also the Queen's father hid the fact and tried to keep the facade that the king was still alive and well until the Queen gave birth to the heir.

Meanwhile, the main character, our crown prince was also the king child but not from the Queen. The Queen was actually looked much younger than the crown prince but she had more power than him. The crown prince suspected that the king was actually already dead, but he had no proof and he was not able to visit his father due to the Queen's interferences. He was finally being framed for traitor and had to run away while also tried to pursue the truth. The crown prince followed the lead of one of his father physician to found out that the man had died and there was a zombie plague started to spread out.

Once a person was bitten by a zombie, he would turn into one. Apparently, these zombies became inactive during the day and became truly died when beheaded or burned. And they also enabled to swim.

The episodes were shorts with only 6 episodes. But the show has invested a lot of money into the production and each episode is very high quality like a blockbuster movie. Season 2 has been confirmed and I hope that it will continue to be amazing or more than the season 1. I had a lot of expectations and can't wait for it.

In one sitting, I dove head-on in this drama, captured in its unique premise. With just 6 episodes, I was able to finish season 1 in a day. I enjoy historical dramas and zombie centred shows, which was a treat when I discovered Kingdom had both! The character development was great for the Crown Prince as well as the members in his group. Though they had purposely showed less character development of the “bad guys”, as there is a major plot twist at the end. The background story of the plague, was purposely slowly unraveled, to build up suspense and intrigue...

I wouldn't like to be super biased when giving my review about this drama because I really like Joo Ji Hoon as an actor and Bae Doo Na's works always, but I don't have a single complaint about this drama. I wouldn't even like to call it a 'drama', but more like a series. The quality of Kingdom's production is not something that we find in many dramas. The acting was superb, every single character was perfectly well-created, the story developed with such intelligence, it really is unmatched.

Joo Ji Hoon as Lee Chang is such a wonderful character that even his common lack of emotion in his other works (not saying that I think like that but I know many do) is completely fitting in this role. He's passionate, cold-headed, smart, loyal, capable. The perfect king, yet his loyalty is doubted and he's suspected of treason. The way Lee Chang gathers the people on his side to protect Sangju is simply amazing. I really loved this character.

Similarly, Bae Doo Na as Sae-bi was perfect. I know she's always an amazing actress and each and every one of her works is a masterpiece, her characters are always inspiring women, but I must say that I really loved Sae-bi particularly. She's so smart and independent, survived so many things and was summoned to serve the general because of her skills and character, despite her being a simply physician of the commoners. Most empowering character ever!

I'm not going into further detail because I finished Season 2 before writing this review, so I wouldn't like to accidentally spoil anything, so I just want to encourage everyone to watch Kingdom and assure you that you will not regret it!

A period drama with zombies is something I never knew I needed in my life until I came across Kingdom. To start, the story is creatively unique. The last thing I expected from this drama when I saw its cover photo is zombies (but then again, I didn't notice the zombie reflected in the sword). The first season does a good job of introducing these creatures and giving them a sort of background story, all while sprinkling in a little bit of political strife. The story wasn't rushed and it was well written. It has its fair share of plot twists and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Now, I can't really say the same for the acting. The cast is one that I recognize and some of the actors I had enjoyed in other dramas. So, I assumed there would be some incredible acting and even though there were some great roles, others seemed a bit too over dramatic. It could be because this is a period drama, and overly authoritative personalities were the norm back then, but now, it just seems too much. Maybe that's the standard for acting in period dramas, since this isn't the first historical drama I've seen with dramatic acting, but I can't be sure. All I know is that some moments were a bit cringey for me personally, but I was quickly able to get over it and move on.

The music was... fine, I guess. I gave it 8 stars because I can't really remember the score, or what it even relatively sounded like. It was good enough that it didn't distract from the story, but it also wasn't amazing to the point where I was looking up the songs afterwards to add to my playlist. It was average music and that shouldn't drive you away from watching this drama.

The cinematography was alright. It's not a visual-focused drama, so nothing stood out, but the setting was appropriate and pretty, as in historically pretty. The monsters are also well done and look awfully creepy, which is a good thing in this case.

Overall, I'd say this was a pretty good start to a very interesting drama. I gave the rewatch value a ten because the drama is short, which is perfect for a quick fix, if you need one. It sucks for those who are waiting for a second season after binge watching the first one in a day, though. Nonetheless, this is a creepy, well-made drama that you should check out if you're looking for something spooky to watch.

This show is WOW. It contains everything – action, suspense, power struggles, best cinematography, plot twist and a dash of humor. The storyline and characters are appealing enough to engage yourself though it has only 6 episodes leaving you hungry for the next season.

This period drama is not a typical one that we have seen most of the time, it covers with violence and some ruthless torture and execution. I think that makes the story draw to a good impression with extra glamor of customs, scenery, and faces of actors.

Join the ride and it will take you to the zombie apocalypse in ancient Korea.

Just Another Standard Zombie Story...
A standard zombie story. Nothing special about it. Due to the huge success of The Walking Dead, we have seen a plethora of zombie films and TV shows which all tell the same story. Kingdom doesn't add anything new, just placing zombies in the past instead of the modern world. Zombies still eat human beings who turn into zombies themselves. Like what one of the top rated review of this series says on MDL, ""the show isn't too concerned with character development and a deep storyline,"" just standard blockbuster drama with a ton of murder and gore, which quickly gets boring. None of the characters interest me either as I found them all flat or despicable. I watch K-drama for something different. Something that Western media doesn't have. Unfortunately, this series adheres too much to the vacuous zombie stories of the West. Better to spend my time watching quality K-dramas like Reply 1988 or Prison Playbook.

Overused theme but presented a different time and plot
Though Netflix’s Kingdom features an overused theme, they presented a different time and plot. (Yes, I said it and you know it!) Kingdom is set in the medieval Joseon dynasty (1392 to 1897) which was a politically troubling time for both citizens and royalty. Corruption and famine were rampant plus their nation is plagued with the infected and other types of carnivorous and liquor-drinking monsters in various parts of the kingdom.

In a typical period drama or a typical zombie film, you will not see these problems right away. It takes time to build up. But Netflix’s Kingdom’s pacing is fast and more engaging. From the title sequence, we were already given so many clues or Easter eggs about what happened to the King.

That sequence gave chills to my body more than Netflix’s Stranger Things title sequence, to be honest. With the ominous music, dark colour and the incense smoke, the title sequence helped establish the setting and tone of the series.

And the first episode did not disappoint! It was enough for viewers to get hooked and finish all six episodes. Yes, there are only six episodes but each is 43 to 56-minute long. And though it was faced-paced, their execution did not fail to leave a great impression. It also did not fail to love and despise certain characters.

And as soon as I got to the last episode, I was amazed by the great plot twist. The zombies we know does not exist here. Moreover, the infected and the cause were revealed and explained well in this series all thanks to Seo-Bi who acquired Physician Lee Seung-Hui’s journal detailing the use of the legendary resurrection plant which helped her piece things together.

But season 1 ended with a major cliffhanger!

I finished watching the six episodes in a single day, so I don't think I need to tell you how gripping and addictive this first season is! I decided watching due to being a fan of Hyena, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. Hyena is my favourite K-Drama of all time, but maybe is now joined with Kingdom? Definitely a possibility.
Some characters were instantly likable or you at least had a serious connection with them throughout the story, however, I do believe one or two characters could have been expressed further, but considering I haven't watched the second season yet, I cannot criticise too much.
In a very weird description to describe Kingdom, I would say its a crossover between Walking Dead and Black Panther, with a Samurai twist! Which is obviously an amazing way to describe the show! P.S Kingdom is better than Walking dead, sorry haters.

If you like violence, zombies, gore, or anything within that region, this is a must watch!

The drama features many themes and at first I was curious if they would be able to make me believe this world where ghosts exist. I was deeply immersed in the story and the world it built. The drama did a good job at establishing this world and had enough details and information to make the supernatural elements feel real and believable.

The mystery kept me on my edge till the end and the performances of the actors felt fitted to their roles. Kim Dong Wook proved himself as a good actor in other works before and his and the other's acting felt good and compelling. It's not easy to act something that doesn't have a real reference in life.
Those characters were humans with all their flaws and mistake and while one might judge some of their choices, this makes the characters feel more human in the end. The budding friendship and the bond of the three main characters was nice to watch and I'm so glad they drama stayed true to the characters by not forcing a conventional drama love line into it.

One of the reason that made this drama so good is also the music that contributed to the eery atmosphere and also gave a conflicted feeling of desperate and also hope at the same time. The songs were not overused and I never got tired of hearing them.

The drama was great and I would consider rewatching it in the future to let the story unfold in front of my eyes once again.

I had no idea about what The Guest was about, it wasn't really on my radar, when I started watching it. Now, it is one of my fav shows of 2018.

The Guest is unlike any kdrama I've ever seen before. It's bloody and dark and overall just a really good horror show. They really went all out there with the horror sometimes and it was great. The story, way it was shot, the actors, and the music also worked so well together. Overall it was just a really fun drama to watch.

Many people found it difficult to watch because of the horror that was on display. I am very fond of this kind horror, with ghosts and demons and stuff, so I was kind of in my element. I switched off the lights and turned some candles on before (almost) every episode. I had a great time watching it.

The story was for the most part very well put together. It started of very strong (and because of that some of the following episodes felt a bit weaker in comparison), but there were a lot of interesting twists and turns in there and some really fun characters. The begrudging collaboration between the three main characters that, along the way, turned into some beautiful friendship was awesome.

Often when you thought you knew what was going on, or what was going to happen, the drama managed to twist it just a little bit. There were a few times when a episode ended and I just sat there watching the credits and just going; ""oh, shit.""

Some episode were a bit slower than other and sometimes those episodes felt like they were more fillers, especially towards the middle and right before the final episodes rolled around. But you also needed to slow things down from time to time and not have it all action. But there were also episodes were everything just clicked together and everything had a nice pace to it. The drama isn't perfect. No drama is.

There was a time where I felt like we were a bit stuck running around in circles, where there was almost the 'possession of the weak' going on and a lot of the same turns of events were happening and some parts felt a little repetitive, but we were still gathering a lot of new information’s and clues while running around those circles, so I did not mind it too much.

I don't know if I will ever watch a kdrama quite like The Guest again. It felt like a unique viewing experience, even if the themes of exorcism and all of that aren’t new to horror movies or shows. I felt the Guest kind of tried to make it their own. For me it was something new and fresh compared to other kdramas. And I shall miss watching it.

I'm usually someone who avoids everything tagged 'horror' but somehow I started this drama and I'm so glad I gave it a chance!
It was so hard to wait for new episodes!

The story is so good, it caught me from the very first episode. I really really hate horror stuff but this one just got me waiting for more. The development of the story, the characters, acting and effects were simply amazing. It lets you guess who the ""guest"" is until the last episode just to realise you got it wrong all the time and things aren't as simple as they seem.

This is now one of my favourite dramas for how unique the plot is, for the amazing acting and for how well it was made overall. Amazing production! 10/10

One Of The Best Korean Dramas In Years....
There has been a noticeable recent wave of South-Korean horror shows in recent years, and there’s no denying that OCN’s The Guest (2018) is not a byproduct of this recent trend.

Yet despite this label as a contemporary drama, The Guest truly plays upon something timelessly classic within its universal horror theme of primeval and the unknown through suspense and dread.

The story premise revolves around our main Male lead, psychic Hwa Pyung ( Kim Dong Wook) chasing after a malevolent demon called Sohn who disturbingly drives people insane. Under the non-conspicuous job occupation as a taxi driver, Hwa- Pyung’s journey to finding Sohn seemingly becomes closer when he is invariably connected with the mysterious Catholic priest Choi Yoon ( Kim Jae Wook) and cynical detective Kang Gil Young ( Jung Eun Chae) ; all of whom have mysterious links to Sohn through their pasts.

As our main lead,Kim Dong Wook seems an unlikely choice to play our main hero,however, his sense of genuine sincerity and anguish in his performance truly captured the essence of Hwa Pyung as a sincere and scarred individual. Alongside Dong Wook costar Kim Jae Wook’s role as the aloof and taciturn Catholic Priest Choi Yoon, truly captured the intrinsic and deeper questioning of a man shaped by traumas. Although less in the limelight than her fellows costars, Eun Chae channelled also the genuine cynicism and doubt of one of the few female officers in her department as well as an individual led by logic.

Yet beyond some more questionable acting performances by some members of the cast, The Guest’s beauty lay within its characterisation; Choi Yoon initially distrusts Hwa Pyung just as much as Eun Chae is doubtful of the “ mumbo jumbo” beliefs of the “ superstitious” duo on their first initial meeting. It is only when the entire trio are forced to rely heavily upon one another, that they begin to develop genuine friendships and bonds, trialed and tested repeatedly throughout the drama’s later revelations.

Adding to theme of horror , The Guest refreshingly did not rely upon cheap jump scares to generate the genuine bloodcurdling moments when demons transcended beyond the realms of nightmares to reality.

In one scene in particular when Hwa- Pyung is walking through a hospital, the specific usage of lucid lighting and an eery blue glow in the background will truly send shivers down your spine before the climax of the scene. In another scene in the show, Yoon’s quick walk down a district street in Seoul becomes contorted with distorted streetlights, a clear and purposefully ironic homage to The Exorcist (1973).

Although not flawless from several moments of lacklustre acting and undeniably slow pacing in earlier episodes, The Guest was undeniably a brilliant show filled with intriguing storyline, characters and true spine tingling moments as well. Certainly one of the best Korean Dramas in a long time.

Unique and Unforgettable
The only reason why this drama is not a perfect ten for me is because I probably would not watch the first half of episode 1 again, so the rewatch value isn't perfect. But everything else is freakin' dope in my humble opinion.

STORY: The writing is strong, and the plot unique. With the overflow of romance dramas in S.Korea, it's terribly hard to find a gem like this. This drama deals with exorcism (both the Christian and the shamanic exorcism), with very unique Korean traits. Even though the atmosphere is mostly dark and gruesome, the mystery and the characters' relationships pull you in. It has no romance at all, but the very strong family and friendship ties (*cough bromance cough*) make this story a lot more valuable and compelling.

There is foreshadowing in almost every episode, with some red herrings thrown here and there, but most would still point out to the crux of the mystery. My most favorite foreshadowing happened on Ep 8 where the main character, Hwa Pyung woke up in jail. The drunk guy next to him was murmuring something in his sleep, saying ""It's all your fault. It's all you.""

I'd never think that this scene would mean so much. It's just a passing comment meant to wake up our main character. But it actually does mean a lot for the ultimate twist in the end. There's a lot more foreshadowing that I appreciate (i.e. Yukgwang's fate revealed in Ep 2 and the death of crows in Ep 4, etc. ), but the ""jail scene"" above is my absolute favorite.

In my opinion, the ability to integrate a lot of meaningful foreshadowing to the story definitely shows the strength of the script. It shows that the people involved are not just shooting arrows into random baskets. They actually know where the story is going, and that's what makes this drama more substantial and impactful.

CHARACTERS: Aside form the strong story, the other thing I like most about this drama is its CHARACTERS. We're not only talking about the perfect casting but also how the story broke all stereotypes for all the main leads:

Psychic Taxi Driver Hwa Pyung - Despite the incredible childhood trauma this guy has experienced, he still remained kindhearted and open minded. His past is so dark and desperate, but his attitude is still sunny and laid back. He's also very gutsy and reckless. And very brave to a fault. He'll do anything to save a life. Not one to be bothered by any formalities, he'd always say what's on his mind. A very capable psychic but a very lousy taxi driver though. He never completed a single trip for any customer throughout the series.(smh)

Exorcist Priest Choi Yoon - TBH, even though this guy's a priest, that does not stop him from being the rudest and most straightforward person I've ever seen in any drama. Probably the most uptight one in the room, but still one of the most reliable friend to have around. But even with his poor bedside manners, he would still be the first one to literally sacrifice everything, including his priesthood and his life, to save people. Self-sacrificing to a fault and uncompromising.

Detective Gil Young - I loved that even though she’s the only female in the series, she isn’t no damsel in distress. In fact, she has the most action scenes in the story. Being the sole protector of the trio, this female lead's stubborn and brave. She's the muscle of the group also the brains, as her incredible intuition saves them most of the time. Has a huge problem with authority (according to her sunbae and chief), but an amazing detective nonetheless.

I also liked how all of them almost lost their jobs because of their mission. Actually, Hwa Pyung lost his taxi driver gig in he middle of the series; Choi Yoon almost lost his priesthood; and Detective Kang Gil Young was suspended and reprimanded a lot of times -- all because of their involvement in the capture and termination of the evil spirit, Park-Il-Do. I like how realistic it got, how it definitely affected and dominated all the aspects of their lives and relationships.

ACTING: Not only the main leads, but even the supporting and minor characters have strong acting chops, especially all the possessed characters. Their realistic acting gripped your attention from start to finish, allowing you to feel both sympathy and righteous indignation to all the people who have hurt them.

MUSIC: It's really hard to pick a favorite aspect of the show when everything is just mind-blowing. From the opening soundtrack to the background music- to the terrifying rhythms and melodies of the rituals and scenes- everything is just flawlessly created. This drama has my favorite track of all time - ""Somewhere"", which is just hauntingly beautiful. Both the original and memory version of the song has that bittersweet and melancholic feel to it. I simply love it.

REWATCH: I've already rewatched this series many times. So the rewatch value is still definitely high. I just steer clear of the first half of episode 1. Because that episode almost made me ""nope"" out of watching it, TBH. I persevered thankfully.

TLDR: This is, so far, the best Korean drama I've watched. It exceeded all my expectations. The fact that I wasn't even into horror and gore and it still drew me in episode after episode is a huge thing for me. Really impactful and memorable. I will never forget this series. Thank you OCN for such a wonderful series.

It's hard to put into words why I loved this drama so much and maybe my attempt will fail to capture its special attribute. I'll try anyway and perhaps get some more people at least interested in it. I admit I shied away from this at first because despite its good feedback, I was somewhat scared to start it. I know, totally insane.

For those who don't have any idea of what they might get themselves into, here's a short comparison:

Imagine your favorite horror folklore movie paired with your favorite horror folklore game (i.e. ""Project Zero"" - if you remember that game, you definitely belong to the older generation :p), then get a 16 hour extension of that, and you'll get ""Guest"". That's how I felt about the story.

(And I was also reminded of The Wailing and The Priests, if that makes it a bit clearer for you)

What makes this drama different from other ones is also its major input of Christianity. I don't recall many shows that use this in such a way. It has always been mentioned here and there, of course. But The Guest is one of the few which utilizes its traits more intensely and combines it successfully with Korea's folklore. The result displays a well balanced mix of Western and Eastern culture.

If you look at the overall tale, the story might be nothing new. Humans' weaknesses lure the devil. It's been a believe since the year one. But the production team still manages to make you involved in the story, be moved by its characters and let the legend get to you (or because we just can't resist watching others fall for their weaknesses). It's hard to not exaggerate, but the visual effects, the setting, the atmosphere, the music... Everything works so well together and lets you enter a totally different yet somewhat familiar world (since we always seek to overcome our own faults/the darkness - or get tricked by evil spirits and fall into despair/snap). In the end it all circles back to us, the human.

Besides its message, the drama tells the story of three individuals who each experienced great tragedy in their past. While trying to deal with and overcome their miseries, they eventually clash years later, not knowing the connection they bear to each other. While pursuing their own goals and always trying to push the other parties out, circumstances force them to work together nonetheless, which in the end results in an unexpected friendship. Due to their pasts, they had chosen to be alone all their lives. But having experienced the same calamity and chasing a mutual enemy ultimately binds them together. A precious, unbreakable bond emerges which is not defined by words but through actions and expressions. You can see and feel how much they cherish each other and how much they would sacrifice.

I actually don't want to write about acting performances and such things, because it's kind of too technical for this review. Let me just say that every one of them did a brilliant job with their character (every supporting role included, even the period ones).

The story telling is neat and follows a wide path without any detours. Of course, you have single cases as well, but all of them are part of the bigger picture. Unexpected twists and turns confuse you all the time and the major mystery stays hidden until the very last moment. But if you keep a close eye, all your questions will be answered when the credits show up. I've heard people say that there are major plot holes. Well, I didn't see them. I noticed some minor things, but those were circumstantial and didn't lessen my excitement.

I'm glad I started this drama. I would have missed a true gem otherwise. If you're scared to watch this, well... I was as well. The first two episodes are the most powerful ones because you don't know what's awaiting you. But the rest is slightly less frightening and you get used to the horror style. Having experienced other OCN dramas, you'll know that they don't hold back with gore elements. There's quite a noticeable amount of it. And despite the crucial parts being blurred out, it actually stimulates your fantasy even more.

Thus, the overall composition with perfectly timed horror elements presents you a lasting adventure whose core doesn't depict a scary legend but what great sadness, despair, willpower and self-sacrifice can unleash.

That being said: Switch off the light, get yourselves some candles and have a great time!
(if you're daring enough - horror gurus might even find this one a relaxing watch)

I've watched plenty of dramas, and this is the first review I'm writing, for good reason.

Going into this drama, I really had no idea what it was about. I typically stay away from horror or scary things, but after one episode I was hooked. The acting in this is unbelievable. Every part was played so well, even just the secondary characters. Hwa Pyung is one of my favorite characters that I have ever seen, along with Choi Yoon. The actors portrayed the characters so well. I could feel their pain through the screen. Also, they were very good looking. That's always a plus.

The story itself had a perfect mixture of comedy along with the horror and tragedy. I found myself laughing in each episode as well as crying and hugging my pillow in fear. I have now related the demon's name to that of Voldemort, something that should never be said out loud. The villain and the heroes were perfectly matched for each other.

Unlike most endings that make you regret watching the drama, I was holding out watching even as the after credits appeared. I was so amazed and absolutely shook, trust me when I say that if you choose to watch this you will not regret it. I can see myself rewatching this show again, and I never rewatch anything. Also, this made me want to believe in God while watching it. That's how good of a show it is.

Please watch it!!!

M.A.S.T.E.R.P.I.E.C.E
Honestly, I cannot put into words how perfect this drama was. I’m huge fan of horror movies so of course this drama wasn’t scary for me at all. For those people who doesn’t watch this drama because of that…please! Give it a change!
I was going to watch this drama because of Kim Jae Wook and OCN..yeah! It’s the best channel around there. After watching Voice OCN never disappoints. BUT…When I saw the official poster I noticed the female lead and I was like WHAT? Who is she? YEAH! That woman is GORGEOUS! Coming back to my senses…For me, the drama wasn’t slow at all. I enjoyed every single episode. When I was on episode 4 I said to myself that this drama will become a masterpiece. I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. This drama was perfection since the beginning. Can you guys believe that?

Story: The plot is amazing. I couldn’t believe how a priest, a psychic and a detective could become a team to defeat a demon. But the writer showed me how perfect the idea was! Demons, priests, detectives, shamans and possessed people were a great combination. The antagonist of this show is a dreadful and strong demon that possesses people and controls weaker spirits. So, there were scenes brilliantly done even though we don’t know how real they were and we will never know. Exorcism is a topic too far from us. But besides that, those scenes were creepy and well-acted.
Anyway, what I enjoyed the most about this drama was the friendship between our leads. I just I just I just….loved it!! Even though this a horror drama, I didn’t feel it like that. Most of the times I couldn’t stop laughing, there were many funny moments that I enjoyed very much…I think it was because I paid attention to every single detail in the episodes. Hwa, Mateo and Gil, those three were really stubborn and similar. Watching them interact with each other was very pleasant to watch. It was hard for Gil to accept those possessions believes at the beginning, yes she is the detective…her reactions at first were hilarious. But at the end she was into this kind of things haha I still remember how she couldn’t explain those situations to her sunbae. Something that I don’t understand yet is why Gil didn’t have a gun I mean she’s a cop right?
On the other hand, there were sad moments “many” that you could say pain was their destiny, especially for Hwa. He’s the one that suffered the most. But this trio was there to console each other.

Acting/Cast: Absolutely divine!! Every single actor was remarkable on their roles! This is the very first time in my life watching k-dramas that I could see a great chemistry between THREE LEADS! As friends, they were perfect for each other. They’ve grown fond and took care of each other even though the circumstances they were going through. The actors portrayed their characters brilliantly. I could feel their pain which made me loving them more through the episodes. Regarding the supporting actors, they were amazing. Acting as a possessed person should be really hard so my feelings of respect and admiration for all the actors and actresses of this drama. THEY WERE TERRIFIC!

Music: It suited perfectly! I remember when we were on the first five episodes, the viewers, included me, wanted THAT SONG to be released. Sorrow in the dark in my heart, in my soul to see. Ahh…It was perfect!

Rewatch value: It is definitely a yes yes!! I would love to watch this drama again but in SUPER HIGH QUALITY! Perhaps in a couple of years, when I don’t remember anything. (Note: If you have a link to download it. I’m all ears!)

Final verdict: This is definitely my type of drama. No romance but friendship, truly friendship. Of course, this drama is not for everyone but it is a must watch drama. One of the best around there. Please! Watch it! You won’t regret it!

Cheers
Mabe

We all know horror-related movies and series can easily turn tacky quickly. This one did a good job at maintaining balance between the horror elements and actually having a plot. If you've ever watched the Exorcist, it has that type of feel for obvious reasons.

I can understand why this series has the fairly high ratings it has, especially for this genre. The twisted connection between the three main actors and the development of their relationship was done well. I also very much appreciated how the supporting actors did incredibly well with their shifts from a normal human being to just plain creepy.

This isn't one of those ""let me shock you into fear"" or ""let me disgust you so much that it will hopefully leave an impact"" kind of show, which is nice. And although there were scattered moments of drag, there was enough depth to the story and characters where I still looked forward to the next episode. The ending felt a bit rushed and you'll have some unanswered questions or explanations but I was pleasantly surprised at the enjoyment factor.

Bonus points were given to the score because this genre is particularly difficult to do well.

Who’s the enemy? Park Il-do or stupidity?
I love horror movies a lot. I get creeped out really easily and cheap scares work on me so well. But I still love anything horror related. So naturally, I was excited about this show and I’m somewhat glad I watched it. But, ultimately, I feel like what’s supposed to be a straight up horror mystery got messy and boring because of the main characters.

What’s good.

- It’s a horror show. ?
- I liked the way the show set up the main bad demon and the folklore of Park Il-do and the possession of Hwa-pyung. It established the character’s motivation and you sympathize with him.
- I liked having a main demon spirit that’s controlling other spirits. It’s fun to guess which spirit is which.
- The way all three characters had shared tragic history.
- Great side characters even though I think they were definitely under used, especially, Yuk-gwang.
- At the end, the least suspected character turned out to be the bad guy… and then there’s another twist! It was clumsy but still pretty good.
- Some possession cases like the one with a little girl were great.
- I liked Park Hong-ju character who’s just evil without being possessed.
- Some twists were good and unexpected.

What’s not good.

- Three main characters almost ruined it for me. Their initial character traits basically remained the same. A hot head, a stiff emotional priest who shows no emotion and an angry detective who demands evidence after evidence to believe.
- The way characters argue about same things episodes after episodes. It took so long for Det. Kang to believe even after Hwa-pyung was right over and over again.
- The same mistakes over and over again resulting in people’s deaths. They would interview victims/witnesses and leave them unprotected over and over again. Sure enough, they get killed. Almost as if they press reset button at the end of each episode and start fresh every time. It gets old fast.
- These people have no detective skills. They can’t deduce anything. They just can’t put two and two together! Sometimes, evidence is staring at them but they don’t see it. When people act strange, nobody notices like when Det. Koh got possessed and Det. Kang had no clue sitting in the same car!
- This show has the worst chase scenes. Main characters are strangely slow but the bad guys are super fast. If they’re chasing someone, 100% guaranteed that bad guys will get away.
- Cases got unnecessarily dragged out because people kept others in the dark for no reason. Just another lazy way to advance the plot.
- Characters just stand there with mouth open instead of reacting to what’s happening around them.
- They ignored conventional wisdom when convenient. Like how busy hospital is virtually empty just so the bad guys can go in/out undetected.
- Park Il-do seemed to be a few steps ahead of the main characters at all time. How? Is he omnipresent or does he have his underlings everywhere watching them? It’s not explained well. Toward the end, you wonder if Park Il-do is actually omnipotent, too, as he can “possess” multiple people at the same time.
- Understandably, they try to keep you guessing on who Park Il-do is but the way they try to bait and switch is pretty clumsy. If the show wants you to believe something, you know it’s not the case.
- Once again, people at the top are corrupt and cowardly. What’s new? Koreans really hate people in power, don’t they?
- Please, please, turn the lights on! Wait until the daytime to do things.
- The ending is kinda wanky. It would’ve been better if they left Hwa-pyung dead but I guess they wanted a happy ending for everyone.

Overall, it was a serviceable horror show with some good moments and a lot more WTH moments. I wish they had a clear way to end the show but after meandering for 14+ episodes, they realized they only had one or two episodes to tie it all together. They ended up spending way too much time on exposition as they basically had to explain all their plot holes just before the show was over. And that ending… it’s like everything was for naught after what they all went through. This seems like an ongoing problem with lots of K-drama.

Tbh I had high hopes for this one. The premise itself was fresh to the world of kdramas and not to mention it was from OCN which pretty much has some of the best thriller/crime dramas around.
But unfortunately, this one didn't work too well for me for several reasons .

-Stuff that I didn't like:

*Messy plot- I feel like the script writer had this great idea on how to keep things in suspense and build the tension and shit but it didn't translate that way on screen and ended up just being frustrating . The reason I first dropped this in the 10th ep was that it just kept on dragging along in circles without any sort of major discovery. Up until then I had to force myself to complete an episode. Luckily though, it did improve a lot from then on wards , but that doesn't make up for the fact that they just wasted all those eps without getting to the point.

*Under utilization of certain characters: I'm talking about Yook Gwang (hyung) and Detective Goh here. Those two characters could have definitely been of more use . Especially Detective Goh who was kept in the dark way more than necessary. Both of them could have worked together with the 3 leads as a complete team. Also they should've been made to interact more with each other - felt like they missed great opportunities for some comic relief there. Not to mention that if a season 2 is in the works killing off Yook Gwang hyung wasn't really a necessary option, in my eyes that is.

*Mateo- I watched The Guest for Kim Jae Wook but the entire show I was left feeling sorry for him. Such a talented actor but it was a waste for him to take on this role. There was nothing that drew me to his character. I'd dare say that he was even more of a bland character than Yoon hwa pyung. The amount of times I had to face palm myself because his emotions clouded his reasoning . Though I could understand him it was frustrating to see him go back and forth on whether he should just trust hwa pyung or not, and he pretty much had no tactic at all -we see that when he interrupted the mass by Father Yang to confront Park il do, which in my view was a pretty stupid thing to do without thinking of its consequences.

*Centering on Yoon Hwa Pyung way too much: I wished they made the story in a way that it would center on the 3 leads equally. There was too much of needless focus on YHP (who wasn't really a spectacular character to begin with) leading to some characters like Mateo who had the potential to rise up not being able to.

* The same with Mateo , the three leads were way too emotional for my liking sometimes.

- However the drama wasn't a complete failure
there were things I did like, such as:

*The ''possessed'' acting from the side cast- This is something NO ONE can argue about! These people literally carried the show almost taking away the spotlight from the main leads. They reminded me again and again why I could never become an actress -like how do you act all out in front of the camera and entire crew like that?? Especially in those exorcism scenes where they have to scream, ""PARK IL DOOOO!!"" and throw up all that water while the main three leads watch you do that ( let me tell you if I had to do that in front of Kim jae wook, I'd pretty much die of embarrassment lol)

*Kim Dong Wook's acting- I've never kept tabs on his previous works so I didn't know what to expect, but the man absolutely outdid himself. It didn't feel like he was acting at all, just actually living as Yun Hwa Pyung in the way he talks, laughs, cries , etc... Also that difference in expression when he got possessed by PID was clear and distinct from YHP. His character itself was nothing great in my opinion but Kim Dong Wook's acting made him really lovable.

*Kang Gil Young- Newest entry into my list of girl crushes. Unlike the plot, her character was written pretty well. I love how they made her the most physically strong out of the 3 leads (yes, I enjoy seeing females kick ass) and I adore how she's her own person and doesn't take shit from anyone. Also her partnership with detective Goh is one that I looked forward to seeing in every ep.

*Chemistry between the 3 leads- I dropped the drama in between and picked it up after so long cause I missed their friendship ( should have added that in one of the tags) . It was the thing that actually managed to save this whole show. The sea scene in the last episode with Mateo and Gil Young trying their best to save Hwa Pyung was pretty legendary I'd say .

*Park Hong Joo- she was just weird . But it works so well on her I couldn't hate her XD. She'd probably go down as one of my favorite female characters/villans

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway all the OST's were really nice especially 'Somewhere', so I'll be listening to that a lot.
I don't really re-watch a lot of dramas , especially ones like this that have their story all over the place, so yeah the re-watch value's pretty low for me.

Thanks for reading!

So scary and so good!!
I love this show!! Definitely one of my all- time favorites, and one of the few k-dramas that i have re-watched. This show is so creepy, an excellent horror show. I'm a big fan of Kim Jae Wook, and i really enjoyed his role as the 'hot' priest (ie he is so good looking and such an excellent actor that he could vacuum for an hour and i will happily watch! ) He and the rest of the stellar cast do not disappoint!! Right from the beginning, it is set up like an interesting mystery ( who is Park Il Do), and it holds the suspense and tension all the way through, it makes for excellent binge watching.

PERFECT. BRILLIANT. YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS!
# 1 drama on my list. Well-written and well-portrayed.
My 9 year old daughter is a scared cat but she can't stop watching every episodes with me. That's how oddly beautiful this drama made. Highly recommended. If only I can give a million star rating. Nope, I'm not overreacting, it's just I can't compare this to other drama or movies. This is a MASTERPIECE.

The writers might have the most talent. Thank you for creating this storyline.
The actors, I can't imagine some other who can give justice to their characters like how these actors did in this drama.
OCN you made the right choice.

I myself was possessed, I know everything. I have talents as well in spirits but all those worst times made my faith stronger more than ever. From a shaman to a priest. Yes I'm healed. Forgiveness and allowing others for help is the key. Prayer of St. Benedict and St. Michael , is the best weapon in an exorcism.

Why I applaud this drama because of reasons, I can relate to every character. Nothing is wrong with this one, they made a research for sure.

Seldom do we see such gripping and captivating dramas in dramaland. Dramas that start strong and stay like that throughout their run. The guest is a near-masterpiece of the genre, that wasn't afraid to actually go for it, wasn't there for cheap scares, didn't base its plot on jump scares and did not settle for thriller character cliches.

Two aspects were aced here, being so well executed, that actually made me overlook any possible minor plot hole or mediocre acting that passed through the episodes.

Plot-wise, taking a leaf out of pretty much every psychological/religious drama scenario, we get a pretty classic story of a superior evil spirit who possesses someone, kill some people and years later relatives of those gather by chance to avenge their loved ones deaths. What a great way to make the story personal and lure you in. It just always works, doesn't it?

But what exactly made this drama truly great? The cinematography. When it comes to thriller, you need two things, a good enough plot (innovation doesn't always equals quality) and excellent editing. The story is there and believe it gets carried on wonderfully, with its twists, its cliffhangers, teasing and confusing the viewer to keep things fresh and it does always work. However, what exceeded my expectations here was the montage and effects.

The drama focuses on exorcism. Being a religious thriller enthusiast, I've devoured more than half of Hollywood's exorcism-themed movies (the original 1977 version of the exorcist still being the best), I can safely say, they freaking delivered! The music, the editing, the montage, the colors, the atmosphere, the sound effects, the cuts, the directing, everything was top notch. Creating and cultivating a creepy, gloomy, ominous, sinister and ultimately terrifying aura that not only draws you in, but also sends shivers down your spine, makes your eyes water and pretty much makes you wanna sleep with the lights on. Thriller goal met!

The drama can be separated in two parts. The first 8 episodes focused more on separate sub stories that all tied up and were obviously connected in the end, simultaneously helping the main characters from some kind of bond which will be instrumental for the drama to work later on. While the latter 8 episodes focused on the actual goal of the story, find and vanquish the evil spirit!

The drama a started extremely fast paced, the first couple of episodes were exhilarating, it does get slowed down later on, but finds its pace quickly. While this did bother me, the flawless creepy atmosphere of the whole thing made up for it. The drama does not get dragged, although you do get your average classic unnecessary lengthy kdrama conversations while setting the story and I could stay and mention some possible plot holes I stumbled upon, but who really cares. Insignificant details In the great scheme of things. I will, still, praise the development of the story and the number of twists they pulled on us. Special mention though, should be the game they played with our minds, keeping us guessing who the bad guy is without getting annoyed, for like 7 episodes or so. My attention span is way lower than this usually.

The second aspect that worked wonders here were the characters. I especially enjoyed how flawed they were, not your average hero-y people you'd find in similar dramas. I can understand why they could be seen as irritating, they indeed were, but that made them that much more human to me and I loved that. Moreover, I adored their relationship. It felt too real. They never stopped fighting and the drama lacked random cute moments between them, but you could see how they grew to care and depend on each other. Nice writing there. The actors also had commendable chemistry and it showed.

I should mention that the drama features some (neccessary to be honest) comic relief which was quite constant too. I enjoyed that too.

As far as the acting is concerned, imma give a shoutout to almost every supporting actor here, cause their role in making this work was instrumental. The main cast was good, but not exceptional or particularly memorable. Nevertheless, I especially enjoyed Kim Hye Eun, who was luscious in every scene!

Off to the hard part, this is a totally worth watching drama, a must watch if you want. Nonetheless, it is scary, and if you got issues with possession, exorcism, religious things, blood, noises of bones cracking, creepy smiles and generally cannot watch a horror film alone, you... might want go rethink this. Still, I would definitely recommend you try or force a friend or loved one to sit through it together. I can easily guarantee they will have fun if they are fans of the genre. This is s good one, not to be missed!

Three Fates Intertwined
Is it the demons we should be afraid of, or are humans the scariest of all?

First things first, TW's for explicit gore (even though they blur it out, it is pretty aggressive), excessive violence, and other dark elements.

This is the dark tale of a demon who is determined to wreak havoc on the world and the three people who fight him with everything they have. They say Sohn comes from the East Sea, and he comes to prey on those who have fears or anger living inside them. By the hand of fate, three children's lives intertwine through Park II Do (Sohn) after he kills their parents/loved ones. They all meet again when they get older and come together to hunt down and eradicate Park II Do who has been hiding the whole time. We follow along on their exorcisms and dangerous mishaps. There is plenty of mystery to go around, and they basically run circles around who the true culprit is. I was quite impressed with how well the story continued to lead bread crumbs while keeping me on my toes to the very end.

The acting is very on point. I cringed, cried, and cheered our good guys on. Everything was believable right down to the demonic possession and the desperation in our main characters. There is no romance, but there wasn't any room for it in the plot and the chemistry between the three mains stands out wonderfully. I think the only thing I would critique about The Guest would be how lengthy it was. I'm not sure if it was all the dark elements with barely any reprieve, but it did feel a little long for my liking. It was to build suspense, which it did well, but I think it could have been shortened a little bit along the way. However, it hit the nail on the head for the horror, thriller, and mystery storyline so I'm not too hung up on it. The OST is hauntingly beautiful and I suggest checking it out even if this drama doesn't seem like your cup of tea.

All in all, a good drama and well worth the watch. I would recommend if you're looking for something with dark, serious, and rewarding content.

Didn't expect it to be so good
I don't exactly remeber how I found this drama but I'm glad that I did.
If you're tired or taking break from romantic movies like I am, You need to watch this drama. Even though it's supernatural, it delievers everything that is preffered in a drama. The three main actors portrayed their roles perfectly. I naturally tend to keep a drama on hold or drop it if it gets boring in the middle, but this drama never troubled me. I completed this drama within 4 days which is quite fast for me.
What do you expect from a drama? Good storyline? Friendship? Bromance? Satisfying ending? Well, you can find everything here. Does not become boring and will keep you in the edge of your seat throught the entire drama.
I'm into romance-thriller drama. Some might think it would have been better with a bit of romance but trust me, it was a lot better without romance. Anyways give it a try and you won't regret it.

""It came from the East Sea...""

As someone who loves, but is not easily scared by horror, this show is terrifying, in a beautiful, tragic way. Although it is visually horror and the initial plot is very similar to a typical ghost story, this show is so much more than just that. It is somewhere between genres, somewhere inexplicable. The fear that it evokes doesn't come from the images or jump-scares, it comes from the story and the acting. It's one of those shows that can't really be explained in its entirety because its much more than just plot and images, it's feeling and emotion.

I found myself on the edge of my seat the entire show, and finished it in 3 days. There was never once a dull moment. The acting was superb, from both the main leads and the side characters (including the possessed). Kim Jae Wook really outdid himself... I thought it was his best performance yet. The possessions were very realistic (if that's possible lol) and relied on acting as opposed to CGI. The story was well thought out and compelling. The music, often very experimental and ambient, was simply chilling and very fitting for the tone and atmosphere of the show. As I mentioned above, I'm not easily frightened by horror, but this show had my heart pounding. The jump-scares didn't shock me, the graphic nature of the violence didn't disturb me, however the suspense was inescapably nerve-wracking.

I don't recommend this show to the faint of heart, but I recommend it to anyone who can stand a bit of horror. This show leaves a lasting impression and won't be easily forgotten, not in a nightmarish way, but in the sense that it will leave a mark on the viewer. I feel like I've said a lot of nothingness, but this show is immensely difficult to describe in words. The only word that comes to mind, the only word that can adequately describe ""The Guest"" is...

haunting.

A show to look up to.
After finishing the show i have only got one word for it 'MASTERPIECE'. If there is a show that had got everything perfect from the story to acting and cast it has to be this drama. A round of applause to everyone related to this drama. They pulled off something out of this world. Each and every episode keeps you tied to your seats. If you are thinking of watching this show don't give a second thought and just go for it. For those with a weak heart stay brave as it has lots of bloodshed. But still give it a shot.

Watch it without giving a second thought
First thing first, OCN is riding on such a high because of such amazing stories and dramas, you have to give the network their due credit for not shying away with experimenting with every kind of genre.
The story is really something to think about because it shows real life problems from a different and twisted perspective, you may or may not agree with but have to admit to the ills of the world. The whole concept is masterfully tackled and there is no empty space between the story, acting and the final product. This one is for everyone to watch. Do not miss out on a gem of a drama that needs much-deserved appreciation.
As for the cast, what to say. Mind-blowing chemistry between the leads and the supporting cast, especially the ones that had to act out ""possessed"". From grandpa to a child, everyone was amazing at their work. The way each lead played off, off on each other's energy was commendable. Kim Dong Wook, Kim Jae Wook and Jung Eun Chae were the perfect casting and has become one of my favourite team to root for.
The story is a rollercoaster ride through and through and keeps you on your toes until the very end. Usually, such stories are difficult to express due to fear of making it look draggy, but not here. The writers did such a fantastic job jotting down each character and situation that there would be almost no loop-holes to be found.
Such a perfect drama can only come from such a fine network.

Honestly, this I'd the first ever horror drama i've ever watched. It definitely did not disappoint. The suspense and anticipation for every episode was high. The cinematography was really good. The music was 10/10 really suitable and it gave me chills. It really felt creepy. This is something to watch when you want adventure, suspense and the feeling of getting surprised every time. The story was executed well and the acting was really really good. It didn't feel boring at all at some point and you really have to pay attention to it and you would want to miss anything.

One of the great ones. Give it a watch.
My expectations for this drama were quite high because of the rating. Gladly, it didn't disappoint. It was so riveting that I binge-watched it and managed to finish in less than 48 hours. Of course, some chores were done in between, some had to wait, and I’m a bit sleep-deprived. But all’s good because I was absolutely entertained. I think the thrill and suspense made my blood flow improve. The drama hit the spot. The reunion scene got me all choked up.

The trio's acting was excellent. But, I found KimDongWook's powerful the most. I think I'm gonna be watching a lot of him from now on. 😊

One of the best K- Drama if I Can Call even is one the best TV series
This the first time i write review in my Drama list, but The Guest deserved that, cinematography, music Scoring, and acting set up high standards for me to watch other K-Drama, back in day in when i watch it in 2018, i don't really pay attention to K-Drama because the infamous steorotype that K-Drama can't hold their quality in stable are from first episode to end episode, usually after few episode left out, their quality will go down unexpectedly, and unnecessary lovelines just for sake of fan service, but The Guest prove my judgment was wrong, i kinda feel bad there is not much hype and talking about this show that deserved to get, i will call this show was one of hidden gem of K-Drama, even now i watch many drama until 2021 yet i can't found another one that hold special place like The Guest

HOW COULD YOU SHOT MY HEART LIKE THAT!
What I like the most is this trio's combo. The detective, the exorcist priest, and the psychic. One of a kind trio I've ever seen! The three went through a difficult battle and never failed to give in my cheer and respect.

The casts portraying the possessed people were so amazing too!

Another tricky point was the revelation of the real culprit. I meant the body the demon went it. I'd not blabber anything about it but just be prepared and try not to OH challenge.

...I hate it when the reason the culprit kills was just for fun. It could have some sort of a heavy reason to make it build a stronger plot. I don't like it to be a circus and juggles the main characters (not just them) being played while seriously fighting for their goal. It's sickening. I know it happens to almost every death or serial killing dramas and I just don't know why. Psycho things? Like seriously it affected and ruined lots of people, others died, suffering. And it happened because of a piece in a whole pizza. It wasn't that huge to make a fuss!

It affects the entire plot of the main root of a story — the reason why the antagonist does this and that — how the conflict was born. But if I generalize everything, it's merely so-so.

A solid supernatural drama
1. Story - 1/2 star
The story is ok, nothing spectacular, but not bad either. There's one recurring spooky mystery throughout that has a few twists and turns that kept me engaged. Like most dramas, I felt it went on for too many episodes. I loved that the female character wasn't there to become a love interest and was a total badass.

2. Behind the camera - 1 star
What gave The Guest a boost in its rating was the filmmaking. This was directed and captured wonderfully, there were some shots where I thought ""oh damn"" because it was feature film quality filmmaking. I could tell a lot of love and care went into the production!

3. In front of the camera - 1 star
There were some great moments that were genuinely creepy because of the use of practical effects vs. CGI. The way they represented the spirits was excellent, some great practical makeup in here too. Acting was solid, especially all the possessed scenes.

4. Post-production - 1/2 star
Good editing, pace was built up really nicely and didn't have the typical frantic cutting that most TV has. Music was fine, nothing special.

5. Lasting Impression - 1/2 star
I'm glad I watched The Guest, it was a lot of fun for me! I'm a huge fan of horror so this was right up my alley, I didn't think it was particularly frightening but creepy in places. Would I rewatch it? Nah, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a watch.

Total: 3.5 stars

Epic Drama .
##### Minor spoiler#######
Wow, am completely blown off starting from episode 1 to episode 16. This was such an amazing drama. I cant pin point anything to complain. The acting by the cast (each one of them- starting from kid to adult), OST & production was too good. This will be my my second horror/ supernatural drama that I have watched. It was mostly my curiosity on how exorcisms happened. Always a battle between good vs evil. About The Guest - the writer clearly showed us how each one of them fights their inner demons . It made me glue to my seat to find out who Park II DO was and at the end when it was revealed, my word...who knew that it would turn out like that.
Trio : Father Choi, Yoon Hwa Pyung & Kang Gil Young - How fate played in their lives for them to meet again. That scene where all 3 as kids are standing in the middle of cross roads and the music 'somewhere' being played was giving me goosebumps. Kang Gil Young, a strong FL who did not believe in these supernatural finally did accept what was happening around. The guilt she had cos of not speaking to her mom just moments before death was heartbreaking to see. The bond between Father Choi and YHP starts with a rough edge which later leads them to die for one another. Ep 16, the last 20 mins of them battling the demon at the sea was beautifully taken...I cried a lot. Since its left as an open happy ending , i hope OCN can make an another season with the same trio.
Ghost cast :D (Ya, I need to mention about them as well. Kim Yeong Soo , Choi Min Sang, Kim Ryun Hee & the cutie Jung Seo Yoon did a terrific job)
Will definitely watch it again.

I just finished watching and all I can say is Wow! I have never been a fan of this genre but this was without a doubt a winner. The story pulled me in from the very beginning. I’m so glad the writer stayed true to the main plot/theme. The development of the friendship between the three was superb. The acting was outstanding. Every character was essential to the story. There was not one time when I said why is that character in this story. Also, the horror was not over the top. Again whenever introduced it was within the proper context. And the music was eerily beautiful. Without giving it away I loved the ending. I would love a sequel.

SUSPENSEFUL GAME OF ""WHO'S THE CULPRIT?""
«Warning : It's gonna be a long review, has some spoilers & tho little chance this got people read on this review, I'm still gonna say it ""I don't know why when this drama came out it didn't blew up like any other dramas, because THE DRAMA IS LIT!!"". Please watch it if you can stand with murder, suicide, horror, mystery, psychological suspense, gore & thriller!»

Story : Full 10/10. A 'chef kiss' approved. Very intense & suspenseful. This drama won't let you rest for a bit, even there are few comedy elements in every episode, I think it was just to break the ice/suspense vibe. For someone who do believe that God, Demon, Angel are real & had paranormal experiences before, I can relate to this drama very much. Maybe that's why I felt very terrified on almost every episode (esp for Father Choi scenes, it scared me like hell). I personally viewed this drama is the leading drama for any exorcism dramas & movies out there, including Hollywood. Judge/bash me if you want, this drama was scary & sometimes too disturbing for me.

Anyway, like my headline said, the main plot of this drama is like a suspenseful version of game finding who's the real culprit, aka in this case the mainleads were finding the identity of the demon-Park Il Do. The intensity came from the drama of finding & suspecting the demon. While some episodes may convinced you on which person the demon stayed, it turned out to be wrong & there's more to the story. You'll feel like investigating with the mainleads & that's also what made this drama a masterpiece. Altho no romance this drama has executed paranormal/exorcism/demonic/horror/mystery/thriller genre successfully.

But for the record I must say that this drama actually could be shortened into 12/14 episode? There are few episodes (towards the end) that doesn't actually matters & felt repetitive. The anger dialogues between the mainleads also sometimes made me annoyed. The stubborn nature of the mainleads and some stupid decisions actually could be prevented by much more decent dialogue choice.

Cast : Absolutely perfect. The chemistry are over the top. Every cast for supporting characters are perfect, I can't imagine other casts other than this one. Their visuals & skills to be immersed with their characters are 10/10. I love seeing how in time, mainleads are bonding their friendship. Broken people with same dreadful & sad past, people who were mocked, exiled & hurt by the society. Yes their road to realize that what matters the most is each other was rocky, but I love how the ending still supports their friendship as everyone is alive & it depicts that ""hope & light are always there in every darkness"".

Cinematography : 10/10. It has high quality shots, pacing & it really helps to build up the tense & dreadful vibes. If you're used to watch Hollywood movies, this drama will also surely raised your standards.

Music : Absolutely perfectly chose & placed. I don't quite remember the osts, but I love how they used Korean traditional ritual music & bells effect in every Hwa Pyeong's vision scenes appeared.

Leasons To Be Learned : There'll always darkness in every person. It's depend to us whether or not we let them control us, or we defeat them by forgiving ourselves & the people that we may hate. Even if in every job & society we will always encounter with beauracracy, seniority, lies & corruption, those people will eventually got their own punishments, we just have to be patient & let the nature takes over. Lastly, appreciate every moment that you had with your family/friends/loved ones. ?

Overall conclusion : Please do watch it if you love horror movies, capable of watching thru 16 episodes of wondering, mystery & dreadful feelings. Some scenes may disturb you to the point where you felt that in real life these kind of crimes actually happened & hope seems to hard to reach. But don't worry the ride will of course worth your time & experience. This drama will also hit you differently if you also has the same believe with the presence of God, Demon, Angel, etc, even if you don't, this drama will take you to a world where possibilities of scientifically unexplained phenomenons happened. I RECOMMEND IT FOR EVERYONE!!

9,5/10???
(P.S. Would love to see reunion of the mainleads someday. Good job, production team & the casts! Will I watch it again in the future? Maybe, but for now most likely no. I have to rest my eyes, minds & soul after watching this exhausting, disturbing but exciting drama. Maybe in the next few years? I will miss their friendship (and Choi Yoon too? damn, he really is a gorgeous & hot here even if he played a priest role-forgive my thoughts, guys???)

Let me start off with two points.

1. I used to hate OCN dramas, because the stories were so amazing and the cinematography was AMAZING, but the editing was SO POOOOR. It was shocking, so bad, that I could not watch the dramas, which made me sad because the dramas sounded SO INTERESTING!

2. I cannot stand possession/exorcism movies, I find them annoying, boring, cliche, and so ridiculous (my eyes spend a lot of time rolling); I usually only watch them when I need a laugh.

Considering those two points there was NO WAAAY I was ever planning on watching this drama, but one day I saw my sister watching something interesting so I watched an episode with her, and then two episodes, and then I watched them without, and then I finished it...

This drama is one of The Best dramas I have ever seen.

The music is so beautiful. The acting is phenomenal. The story is fantastic! The Shots are just Beautiful!Each episode has its own story, but there is also the overall arch. The story lags ever so slightly around episode 11, but quickly snaps back to awesome. Absolutely worth a watch, it really is just so amazing!

OCN really got their act together! I'm so excited for future works (the editing is still a bit choppy, but much improved)!

I must say, this is a decently unique drama. I have seen my fair share of horror dramas and this one went above and beyond. There was no cheap CGI or awkward effects, and the horror scenes had me holding my breath. The main antagonist gave me so much goosebumps, too.

The overall plot was pretty good. It's a bit typical, but at the same time, it stands out enough to draw you into the story. It's also not bad enough to drop the overall rating from a 10.

The acting was incredible and the main characters, in my opinion, were likable, although some other viewers had a dislike for the main protagonist. I guess it depends on what human qualities you dislike in real life. The side characters were amazing as well, and no one drew away from the story.

The music added to the cinematography and went well with it. At one point, I had associated the main antagonist's theme song with the fear I felt toward them that whenever the song played, I grew a little anxious, even if the antagonist was no where to be seen.

All in all, this was a really good horror drama with scenes that had me re-watching them multiple times. It's a very good watch, especially during the Halloween season. It drew me in and had me rushing to go watch it. I finished it in three days! I recommend this to anyone who loves a good horror mystery!

This is the best horror and psychological Korean drama I have ever seen, and I've seen quite a few.

The acting in this drama is absolutely astonishing. Every actors including the side actors need an award. Especially the chemistry between two specific main actors (no romance).

The music throughout the 16 episodes are beautiful, especially the ending songs. Before something dark is about to happen there is always eerie music which makes the scare even more better.

The story itself impressed me a lot. I've never seen a Kdrama doing this kind of plot before which makes it even better. A lot of Kdrama are a bit cliché especially when it comes to the horror dramas, but this always keeps you on your toes and makes you second guess everything.

Overall, this is on my re-watch list and I'm pretty sure I am going to keep watching it due to the main actors and the plot itself.

Give this a go, you won't be disappointed!

I’m not a big fan of horror shows nor do I watch them on usual. I often find them way too out of sync with the reality, and as a result, not that scary or even credible. (Speaking of dramas only, movies are on a total different range). From time to time I still try to give this genre a chance and that’s how I randomly started The Guest.

This horror story offers a fascinating investigation, with a dark yet captivating atmosphere, the right touch of scary and mystery, that is quickly becoming a thrill-packed adventure from episode 3 or 4. Besides its scary aspect, this drama is about human relationships, and mostly friendship. Honestly, I am glad that they didn’t incorporate some unnecessary romance in it.

It is obvious that the scenario, no matter how well written it is, wouldn’t be anything without the sublime chemistry of our main trio. Delivered by its incredible actors, the characters of The Guest are highly convincing and touching. I believe they where perfectly casted and I wouldn’t imagine anyone else playing their roles.

The excellent directing of Mister Kim Hong Seong should also be emphasized and praised, he managed to offer such a quality show... All the scenes with possessed people were perfectly done and worth the quality of a movie, no bad special effects or cringy moments. The whole atmosphere and the game of lights and sounds where really pleasant to watch. While the noises are mostly frightening, the show could make you cry in a second with its beautiful soundtracks.

About the ending, and of course without spoiling anything; while I find it overall satisfying, I believe some main questions still remain unanswered. I think a second season would be a really great idea and a logical continuation to put a definitive end to the plot. Also, it would be a great pleasure to reunite with our beloved characters for a second time.

As I’m writing this review, I already miss this drama, I became really attached to its characters and I think it won’t be easy to find something to replace it. This is why I highly recommend this drama to anyone who enjoys a quality show... and is not easily scared :)

This is by far the best Korean Horror drama ever.
So this season we got myriad of Korean horror dramas. It's like all the Director's and writer's got together and thought let's just bring the horror genre to Korea and simultaneously many networks released some good horror dramas (still are : The Priest) Many were hits and few were misses but compared to the previous record that Korean held with Korean horror DRAMAS (not movies) this year was actually good.
SO in order to stand out from this long list of horror dramas one had to do well. The guest? doe waaaaay more than good. From the first episode itself it manages to grasp us and not let go. The plot line is nowhere cliche and the characters are very well fleshed out. One thing I liked was that they kept us guessing till the last episode. Personally I feel the last episode was somewhat lacking compared to the rest of the series but it does not make anything less boring. The plot was always moving fast and the story was engaging at its best. One thing I loved is the fact that they managed to give a story with consistent characters. Yes sometimes the female detective was annoying as hell but other than that the friendship and bromance they managed to build in this was wonderful.
Another thing I absolutely loved was the message the director wanted to give us. If you see the ending credits the director clearly states it. It was for the people to know the ugly truth of fellow people. It was not the demons that made those people do what they did but it was their evil nature that they were harboring inside which led the demons take control. The suppressed emotions deep inside. So it is not the demons we should be afraid of but rather the people. Who have the ability to bring such evilness out to this world.

PS- I would recommend this drama to anyone easily why? Because one of my non kdrama fan (actually she really doesn't like them) saw me watching this and thought it was interesting and sat down and watched it with me. She went crazy. She scolded me for watching this without her also. She was that engrossed in this!!! So freely recommend this guys!
Also once you are done go check the BTS of this drama to see the cute chemistry between Kim Jae Wook and Kim Dong Wook and how cutely Kim Jae Wook is around Jung Eun Chae. Actually all three have amazing chemistry going on (I meant in the sense of friendship) their sets are always having fun.

The story plot is really skillful at pulling heart strings
First of all, the story is so deep and meaningful. The stories and backgrounds of the individual characters really bring out the fact that everything starts from ones heart, whether it is caused by internal factors or external factors. There were so many twists in this drama that it kept me wanting to watch the next episode with deep anticipation. This show emphasized the darkness and holes in ones heart and i find that really meaningful. Next the acting. Wow i was really surprised behind the emotions portrayed and it was as if I could almost relate to the character. Self blame and self sacrifice was really brought out with the aid of the actors. Hwa pyung and choi yoon both displayed self sacrifice and was so much willing to sacrifice their own lives for another due to guilt and friendship. I felt like the cast was really on point and it was as if perfect. The music also played a huge part in the emotional scenes. The slow and soft melody created such a heart wrenching scene that i almost cried along with the characters. This drama has both great plot and so many unexpected turn of events that i find myself getting surprised again and again. I believe I will watch it again soon myself. I will admit the effects and gore are a little scary, but they really bring out the evil and represents the darkness in people's hearts really well. This is one of my favourite dramas that got me so hooked to the story. Guaranteed an engaging watch!!

I always avoid Horror, Drama because it's too long to watch till the end, I'm a scaredy-cat but the plot is very interesting and I don't have anything to watch so end up watch it. Just 1 ep. I hooked and even I scared, but I cannot stop to continue play the next episode. Now I will write down to my record that this is the best frightening horror drama I've ever finished. Moreover, very best pilot twist I've ever watched as well. The story is involving a mysterious evil demon thing, the acting by the possessed people are amazing! the main actors did a great job on certain emotions. I personally like the priest while exorcism, he portrays it very well. The friendship that was built throughout the drama was touching too. No love interest just friendship. I would say Masterpiece! Highly recommended!!!

A Must Watch Drama from OCN!
I actually found The Guest by chance when my friend shared a clip of the first episode on Instagram. We decided to check it out (even though both of us are scaredy cats) and that was one of the best decision we ever made. Yes it scared us once in a while, but it was worthed!

The drama opened up with what happened to the 3 main characters in the past and how their lives are linked again together afterwards. The main characters fought among themselves and their relationship turns into something sibling-like along the way, each with their own specialty (Hwapyung with his ""sight"", Holy Priest Mateo, and Gil Young who will kick everyone's ass into pulp). The plot thickens and there are lots of surprises along the way. every episode will leave you wanting to watch more to know what's gonna happen next. You won't be bored by this drama!

Currently rewatching it just because. I heard that they are going to be making a movie based on this drama...I'd rather they made a 2nd season from this one (please OCN?)

As the end credits of this drama say, after all, evil things start in the hearts uf us humans. This drama skillfully connects absolute darkness with unshakable will to fight, it connects the dark depths of the human soul with the hope for some light.

I started this drama because I was curious about how such concepts like horror would be executed in a kdrama. I was wondering how scary it is. It is scary. It is cuel. It is bloody. It shocked me, but it also fascinated me. It was shot perfectly, with an artistical uniqeness - it was in its very own dark way aesthetically pleasing. The start is strong, intense, dark. I feared that it would continue like that and never reach real depth. I was mistaken.
Let me tell you, this is, in a really strange way, the most beautiful drama I've watched so far. You might wonder now, how I (as someone who doesn't even like horror series), could call something cruel like that beautiful? ... Well. The characters showed, that even in the pitch black darkness, even in the hopeless vortex of death and murder, there is something, or someone to fight for. In their own way, they showed the weirdest, but most beautiful friendship I've ever seen in a drama.

I found myself being an emotional wreck because of this drama, it made me think a lot, it scared me from time to time, it made me cry a lot, but most importantly, it made me enjoy it. And that was only possible due to the absolutely outstanding cast, the actors were chosen perfectly and they acted it out in an outstanding way. They perfectly conveyed all kind of emotions, reactions, behaviours, in this very dark, very depressing story. Thanks to the excellent script, it however wasn't senselessly dark. It communicated a meaningful message. The message to fight for what's worth to fight for.

Not your typical k-drama genre but you'll never regret watching it
I would say this drama is by far the best korean drama I've watched.

I was hesitant to start it at first because it was a horror genre series. Not my typical Korean drama genre I opt for. But this drama changed my perception for horror genre. It was so mind-blowing. Not because it was scary or whatever, it's just pure good acting and the storyline.

Hard to believe they've managed to pull off a korean drama to be so good without any romance being involved. Yet, the chemistry between the main casts are so well portrayed and you can literally feel it. Still can't get over the bond between the casts and the soundtrack is so on-point. Brings out all the feels in you.

You tend feel to feel so much mixed emotions while watching this. I'd cried my eyes out for few of the episodes as well.

Overall, it's just a perfect drama with an A class plot. Some horror dramas tend to be illogical or fake sometimes but this was well-scripted with great acting by all the cast.

Go watch to all that are having second thoughts on whether to start the series or not. You'll never regret it.

After “The Guest” the world will not be as it used to be.

There is no doubt that this is a masterpiece: it’s terrifying, scary and weird, but the most scary thing is that it is real and true. Drama portraits possessed people and makes them suggestively authentic; it presents the way how human become possessed by evil and what the way of escape is.
We get to know the protagonists and their characters very slowly. They seem to be weak, and the evil seems to be powerful. But heroes’ imperfect nature attracts our attention and sympathy.

Every episode is frightening, dark and intense, but the last one is… so beautiful. The friendship of priest, taxi driver and cop is unique and special. Surprisingly it is the story about being human, about facing up to the difficulties, about sacrifice and faith. It seems to be a horror, but after watching it I am very optimistic and I think positive about people.

Music turns the drama into the horror. Let’s say the truth: everything is terrifying there . I was able to watch it only during the day, in the night it was too scary...
Certainly 10/10, this is one of the best drama I have ever seen! If you want to watch a deep and interesting friendship, or a lovely sea landscape, or awful zombies - you must watch ""The Guest""!

Evil Vermin Is Lurking
The Guest is a very modern drama, with a contemporean feel and modern filming, looking back on old fears and traditions in its scenario. This anachronic setting might somehow take you by surprise here and there, looking at the show in front of you, and ...
... casually looking behind your shoulders from time to time. But no, this drama is not absolutely terrifying : for anyone who had his fair share of horror movies, you're not going to end up midway hagard and sleepless because of the show, but still the old fears are there : an unfamiliar presence in the dark, a will waiting for your awareness...
Which resumes some of the good points of the show : one of the best thing about this drama is its ambiance. The lightly dark and ever present sense of a dread and imminent danger was carefully instilled along all the episodes, keeping the viewers on their toes, but without getting them to run away as far as they can.
To help with that, the acting cast was amazing, and you could honestly almost watch the show for Kim Jae Wook's ""Choi Yoon/Matthew"" interpretation alone. Not that the others were any less good, really. While his role in this drama stands out a bit, the three main leads, along with the support roles very well-directed were quite impressive.
But with all that ... also comes some flaws to this tv-drama that I can't explain without considering that they had sometimes to sacrifice rational aspects of the background the characters live within in order to push the story further.
Like, for example, leaving the house of a potential victim unguarded - with a very young and sick girl inside at that ! - to run around aimlessly after a suspect. And there's a cop in this lot running around !
This is the kinda thing that can throw you out of the show in a split second, and it's not exactly a rare occurence (while, thankfully, not exactly a common one either).
Obviously it's not exactly sending the show straight to the hell where only the worst k-dramas belongs (with a few authors), but I can't help but think that it was these few mistakes - along with a story stretching out a bit too much - that prevents me to further praise the show, even though I also had a good time watching it.
Still, it's a good drama, with a very good setting and a cast that worked hard to make our knees go soft.
I can only recommend it, and will stop my review right away...
03:00 AM is close.

Recommended Horror-Crime Drama
I love this drama. The story and the trio did a great job. The supporting actors are also good in portraying their characters. I hope that they will release the Movie version soon as what I read in the News. This.drama is recommended to those who like watching crime dramas with a twist. It's a bit scary so don't watch it at night of watch it with someone as the production did a great job to make sure viewers will be interested and scared while watching the drama. OCN is the best in making crime dramas. I'm glad seeing Kim Jae Wook and Kim Dong Wook together again in another genre after watching them in Coffee Prince.

Why Shouldn't Priests Be Sexy?
This drama was so well written. The storyline is absolutely engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. I really enjoyed everything about this show, including the ending, it was all very satisfying.

I initially went into this thinking I wouldn't like it much because (this is how shallow I am) the cover art on Netflix makes it look so uninteresting. The story started off a little slow. Initially everything with the priest character seemed to move at half speed and I wasn't super invested. That all changed really rapidly as the episodes progressed. The chemistry between the three leads is really outstanding and builds progressively through the series. The visuals are also really well done. The lead actors played off each other really well and the supporting actors were cast well and written with a lot more depth than you'd expect for characters showing up in only an episode or two. This made the entire story arc and all sub-plots all seem cohesive without becoming repetitive.

The antagonist role moves around a lot throughout the series, which also keeps the suspense and mystery of the plot very well secured. The protagonists are realistically flawed and the world in general seems more realistic and relevant than a lot of Kdramas. This is the sort of meat and potatoes drama that delivers on everything even while being just another possession/exorcism show.

A very human story
If you want to see a supernatural drama involving evil spirits and possessions that leads to people commiting unforgivable crimes, well you've come to the right drama.

The Guest is a very human drama about a young psychic and two others as they inevitably had to deal with a strong evil spirit that has set its goal on one of them and proceeds to terrorize everyone who ever come in contact with them. It was a scary journey as well as dark one, yet in a way it was quite healing as we watch how Hwapyung, Yoon and Kilyoung try their absolute best to try saving as much people they could while also trying to hunt down the evil spirits as well as the corrupted people that calls for it.

While the supernatural and criminal aspect of the story could be quite dark and scary, the fact that our trio were able to counter the obstacles and save people who were being possessed carried a healing message of hope that good can defeat evil. And that was quite healing, in a sense.

That said, I love the soundtrack. The main theme Somewhere have fully captured the emotional turmoil of Yun Hwapyung and his internal struggle for being the one targetted by the evil spirit. The song was quite haunting and filled with a sense of loneliness. Yet, there was still a hint of hope as you can hear a plea for help slipped in between the song lyrics.

Horror genre is not my cup of tea but this one succeeded in reeling me in. With a solid beginning, this drama makes you question who the 'guest' is. And even if you have the answer, the twist will slap you hard in the face. The three protagonists' interaction was fun to watch and their strong bond made it hard to not love them. If you like a show with no unnecessary romance between its characters, then this one's perfect for you. Their friendship is one of the highlights of the show.

And kudos to the other casts. Playing a possessed person is not easy yet they did it in a way that's so convincing. These people deserve a standing ovation for their marvellous performance.

""Eenie, meenie, miney, mo — who’s the vessel for Park Il-do?"" - Dramabeans (Recap Ep 12)
The above line perfectly captures what the drama quickly descends into after the first episode. I'll admit that the first episode was scary, and I almost wanted to stop watching because I was spooked, but by episode two's end I could tell there was going to be a pattern to this. Hwa Pyung will reunite with Kang Gil Young and Mateo, and go from case to case trying to find where Park Il Do is. The funny thing is that he has no plan whatsoever for vanquishing the stubborn, superior demon, and is aware that previous attempt of exorcising the spirit failed. His shaman friend continues to dissuade him from his mission, reminding him that no one can deal with the demon as it is extremely strong. However, Hwa Pyung refuses to heed the numerous advices given to him by various secondary and main characters over the course of the series.

I was bothered by the lack of character development in all three of the main characters. We are not told what Hwa Pyung has been up to during the time gap between his childhood and his adulthood. His bosses in the taxi service apparently allow him to wander wherever, shirk his duties, damage the taxi he drives, spend large bouts of time not doing his job, and still pay him. He remains stubborn, emotional and reckless throughout the series, at least up until where I watched. Honestly I got sick and tired of the name Park Il Do coming out of his lips every five seconds in every episode. There are no obvious traumatic signs from his childhood incidents, and he doesn't really display any guilt or internal torture after having killed his mother and grandmother while being possessed. He doesn't seem afraid that he might get possessed again and might end up killing the remainder of his family (there's no immunity against being possessed you know!).

As for Kang Gil Young, initially I disliked her character because she is equally stubborn and remarkably slow-witted in the first few episodes. Her interactions with her partner became so repetitive and cringeworthy after a while. He keeps jumping when Hwa Pyung shows up, keeps asking why Gil Young hangs out with him, and she continues to keep him in the dark. Lather, rinse and repeat. A similar pattern is seen with Hwa Pyung and the shaman, with the latter being meek and reluctant, trying to dissuade Hwa Pyung from his reckless endeavors, and essentially being used and discarded as per Hwa Pyung's needs. Shockingly I was fine with Mateo's character, perhaps because his hard-to-read physiognomy suited his job as an exorcist and his background. He displays emotion when the possessed people remind him of the horrors his big brother committed, and he starts to care for Hwa Pyung and Gil Young, while the latter two don't seem to have much attachment toward him.

The CGI was a little disappointing as well. The multiple eye stabbings and people gulping down water like crazy became overused and redundant. The background of the Park Il Do spirit was lackluster and vague. A guy goes to Japan and comes back evil, kills his wife and kid and gives himself over to the devil. That's it?

I found that clicking the next episode was becoming very difficult, and I was watching the drama at nearly 2x speed till I quit and wondered why I should continue to waste my time. The drama was not scary at all after episode 1, and I find it really odd that so many people seem to have enjoyed it.

A Haunting Horror Tale
This year was the year I dipped my fingers into the Horror genre. I tried a little bit of everything: indie, arthouse, 80's classics... While I liked most of what I saw, nothing the West could offer surpassed the kind of excellence ""The Guest"" was.

""The Guest"" opens up with the most chilling, intense and horrifying 30 minutes and continues to build suspense and terror during the entire drama. The premise of this series is relatively simple: three people who share the trauma of the same harrowing night as children come together after 20 years to catch the spirit responsible for the tragedy. Still, this description falls short; nothing prepared for the grip ""The Guest"" would have on me. The series is masterfully crafted, it seamlessly blends mystery, thriller and horror into a dreadful game of cat-and-mouse.

The central characters are deeply flawed - they fight, they're stubborn and impulsive, but also compassionate and very human. The kind of bond that forms between these tragic heroes is one of mutual understanding and loyalty.

""The Guest"" isn't just scary (it might not frighten you at all)- but it's petrifying. Not because of jumpscares and ghosts, but because you cannot help but feel for the possessed people and their awful lives. It's like watching a ticking time bomb finally explode and leave a trail of carnage and blood behind. The exorcism scenes were cathartic and mesmerizing to watch - each was tense and grisly, and the performances were truly immersive.

While the strength of ""The Guest"" definitively lies in the twists, turns and reveals of the storyline, none of it could be achieved without lighting and music. The red, orange, blue and purple hues contrasted nicely with the dark scenes. They were atmospheric and eye-pleasing, perfectly complimenting the cinematography. The lights worked in tandem with the music, too: the title track ""Somewhere"" was beautifully sorrowful, and the rest of the OST was as much haunting, nostalgic and melancholic.

One day I'll return to watch it again, to spot all the clues and gain a new perspective, but for now, I'll leave ""The Guest"" how it is - a masterful piece about humans and family tragedies.

this drama had a really strong start for me, then it got slow and then the ending felt rushed. i really enjoyed every cases in this cus i’m all for that thrilling, gory stuffs hahah those things really got me hooked!! and i like how every case helped them to gain some info about the ‘guest’. but it got dragged in the middle and it felt super slow. the plot also got messy towards the end and i just thought that some scenes were left unexplained. but it was still okay i think. the 3 main leads, i love the chemistry between them but i noticed that they always fight?? and that sometimes annoys me. but the casts and the side casts, the ones who acted all those possessed victim, just wow. it felt so real and thrilling. and the music was wow too, amazing how it really suits the scenes!! loveeeee.
overall, i actually have watched another drama which is quite similar to this one, but i enjoyed this waaay more. the storyline of this drama is more interesting and i enjoyed itt.

Creepy mystery.
Most of the time I tend to stay away from the horror genre because the writing is always last on the priority list and heavy on the jump-scares and gore. Not this one. This has an actual story which begins when a series of unexplained murders take place in a small coastal town in South Korea. After a series of tragic events that affect the lives of three children well into adulthood, they are once again reunited to solve a series of murders that are gruesomely tied to their past. Now a cop, a priest, and a taxi driver, these three must uncover the sinister secrets in order to solve the mysteries that have altered their lives and threaten to destroy their futures.

The three MLs are well-developed characters masterfully played by Kim Dong Wook as the taxi driver, Kim Jae Wook as the priest, and Jung Eun Chae as the detective They are all damaged adults changed forever by tragic pasts and reunited in friendship to fight crime and battle their dysfunctional personalities. The cop is angry and unfulfilled by loss. She has a chip on her shoulder, a loner, and feels she needs to prove herself by catching the bad guys. She is a force to be reckoned with and that leads to trouble among her colleagues. Jung Eun Chae embraces her character and plays the abrasive and distant detective well, yet brings out a fiercely protective and caring side in the face of danger. Kim Dong Wook is the amateur sleuth taxi driver who is much more interested in solving mysteries than driving his clients to their destinations. His tragic losses have also kept him from forming meaningful relationships due to a struggle to trust others, including those who want the best for him. My favorite character, though, is Kim Jae Wook as the young priest. Jae Wook portrays his character as a quiet brooder, who is very courageous and vulnerable at the same time. He doesn't shy away from his duties no matter how much they affect him. He is ready to sacrifice himself for his friends to the point of pushing them away for their safety. (It also doesn't hurt that he looks so slim and appealing in his priestly garb!) These three are, in fact, masters at pushing each other away until they realize that they are much more effective as a team. The journey of blame and mistrust giving way to fierce friendship is one of the aspects I most appreciated in this story. Stellar performances even from the guest and supporting cast make this show a treat to watch despite the subject matter.

The writing is excellent for the most part. It is gruesome, disturbing,, and downright creepy. At a little over an hour per episode, I could only endure two episodes per day because it is a scary, edge-of-your-seat kind of show. The circumstances surrounding the mysteries keep you guessing until the very end as to whom the culprit might be, Even then there is a twist. The OST is awesome and carries the drama beautifully. This is definitely one to watch if you like creepy mysteries.

The best written thriller show I've seen in a lot of time!
I give it a 10 because I can't give it more, but I would if I could! This is one amazingly written drama where the writers gives you all the hints of who the bad guy (does it count as a bad guy when we are talking about a demon?) really is but they are so good at telling the story that they distract you with other different clues so you keep going round thinking about some possibilities when they are there as the perfect smokescreen. As a fan of mystery, thriller and crime stories this one has been PERFECT for me as for once i have been fooled till the last episode and when the explanation came it was logical and well prepared.
So if you like a very very good mystery and you do not sppok when it's about demons, possesions and religion this will totally captivate you.
On top of the story the directing is well paced and brings you in the story with the characters, which are another great point of The Guest. It's impossible to watch and not feel affection for the trio of mismatched heroes and the plethora of other characters presetented in all the episodes. All the actors have done an incredible job, the ones playing possessed people were so unbelievably good! My only regret is that now when I will rewatch it I will already know how it ends.

Suspenseful, never boring and...great cinematography
Overall: I loved this one. It's visual quality and production is superb, with the gory and the scary, on par with Strangers From Hell. OST contributed so well to the overall atmosphere and is def worth your playlist. Which reminds me of myriads of emotions this drama made me go through. I was freaking scared (and I watch horrors w no problems), but also I connected to the characters so much that I found myself getting emotional at certain points. This drama does not get boring or monotonous from 1st to last episode, which says a lot on a drama that is based on a single, repeatable purpose, of catching a spirit. This makes it definitely is a worth watch. However, I do not find it rewatchable; while entertaining I did not take the message of the drama, which arguably could be familial love and loyalty as motivation for difficult steps (or revenge?), I did not find drama's message as something clear or meaningful enough for a rewatch. Just meh in that portion.

Detailed Breakdown:
Actors: 8/10
Actors were great, especially main lead, the taxi driver. I forgot their names already but that does not take away from overall exceptional performance. This drama really stretched the characters across spectra of morality, preoccupation, emotions and relationships and I have to say that I trusted the characters 100%, they comfortably switched between one extreme to another.

Storyline: 7/10
The storyline was very refreshing. I thought that three main leads coming together against the spirit, that has ruined their families (and lives), was executed superbly. I did believe each character in their actions which means, for me, that characters were developed well, and they make the storyline.

Entertainment:9/10
I don't know why for so many people mention this drama was not scary. I was freaked out throughout. I find myself recently not finishing most of the dramas I start, I wane off around ep. 12. However, the writers of the Guest knew how to build up tension and make it every time feel different. It definitely kept me in my seat.

Graphic and Aesthetic Quality: 9/10
This show did not hold back on presenting murders in the most graphic way possible. Also the whole demonic-exorcist procedures going on were in intense, and they really used the names of real figures in Catholicism while performing exorcism. This is 2018, but it's gory quality reminded me a bit of Strangers From Hell.

OST: 10/10
The main OST really contributed to the experience of the drama. I absolutely loved how they used their music.

Rewatch: 5/10I am certain that I will go back to the OST, but while it is entertaining and a great experience, I don't feel the need to rewatch it.

Thanks for reading!
Have a good one,

I don't have any complain about this drama because it's really good but not rewatchable for me. Hehe..

I am glad that the kdrama are now open in this kind of drama about paranormal. I love horror and paranormal movies.Asian are still the best in this genre. Watching The Guest is really refreshing in kdramaland. I love everthything about this drama. The three main lead were great as an individual or as a group. One of the reason why I give this 10 because of the side stories of people being possesed. They were possesed without a reason and I liked how they showcase the weaknesses of human beings feeling sad, anger,envy, lust, grief, devastated, emptiness and loneliness.
Realization in this drama is LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL BUT THE WORLD IS CRUEL.
Even the world is cruel,Life is always have a purpose.

The other reason why I give this 10 because of the twist of the story. Hehe.. I thought that my conclusion was right but in the end the big revelation revealed unexpected..I watched so many mystery drama and I am easily solved it but in this drama its give me a rollercoaster ride. .You will thought that you finally seeing the full picture but they will give you other hint that make you think more about it. Haha..

Better to watch this it's really something new.

Worth every minute of your time!
This drama has surprised me sooo much. After watching the first episode which was almost like a movie on its own I was completely hooked. I enjoyed each episode so much that I rewatched certain scenes several times. I haven't seen such great character chemistry in a very long time. They're just perfect together. Sometimes you meet people and you know they're gonna stick with you no matter what and it doesn't matter whether you've only just met them. This is a story of an incredible bond between 3 completely different people whose lives were cruelly marked by supernatural powers in their childhood. Carrying this heavy burden into adulthood, fate brings them together again and they set on a journey to fight the evil which dwells in each of us waiting for the right moment to wake up. This TV series celebrates classic horror themes such as exorcism and shamanism but even though it's meant to be one of the main features it doesn't overpower the initialy subtle line of friendship which only grows stonger and in the end takes over. This aspect gave this series the emotional dimension it needed whithout a need for filler romance which would only ruin the atmosphere. All actors have outdone themselves in portraying their characters. Exorcism spiced up by Korean shamanism was so incredibly interesting that I found myself craving for more Korean lore and traditions knowledge. It spiked my interest and has served as a great tool to flesh out the plot. The music has artfully supported the ambience and is deeply stuck in my mind. Now I just hope I will be able to find it on Spotify ? To conclude this drama will pay you back for your time with more than you expect. Definitely one of my top 5 dramas.

I rarely write a review. But this time it was essential. I had no plane to watch an horror drama but the trailer attracted me and since the first second i was captivated and couldn't escape a single moment. The acting is the best i have ever seen in any drama. The story is so engaging and unique and with a huge plot twist at the end. The music fits perfectly. The harmony between characters is unbeliavable . I loved every single scene part ... thanks sooooo much for such a wonderful drama now all my friends are watching it everyone as overwhelmed as me !!!

First of all I have to admit that I usually don't watch anything related to the genres thriller/mystery/horror because I get frighted pretty easily but somehow I ended up watching this show.
And let me tell you one thing, it was absolutely worth it (I finished this drama within two days).

And to be honest: yes it can get frightening but in my opinion it was okay, I mean it could have gotten worse.

From the beginning on I really liked how those three lead characters harmonised with each other.
I especially appreciated the way the story develops within the drama, you'll get to know more and more details and after having watched it til the end, I can at least say that much:
When you think that it can't get worse, it will - when its too easy, something is off ...

Ohhhh and the ending ....

So in my opinion you should certainly consider giving it a try, it'll be worth it :))

Well I have to tell you something, that people usually add to the end of the review, or whenever, they think of it, but I want to tell it first.

The music. I haven't gotten yet to identifying all the songs and finding their words, but whatever they say, they were perfect. I loved from the first episode every gruesome, every sad, hard, depressing, weird scene. Every one of them was influenced and perfectly played out within the accompanying song. I never felt like the music starts at the wrong time, or that it somehow creates a rift between the scene at hand and the melodies of the song, or the lyrics. I absolutely adore the soundtrack of this drama.

Really good actors and unknown, awesome actors. This is a pretty awesome thing. To create a criminal or mystery drama, also hospital dramas. Lots of short-term(my term for this) actors flitter through the drama. Who hasn't got a lot, or almost no screen time at all. And these days they seem more appreciated and they are given more things to say, to make an impact on the viewer, so more often than not, we remember these characters. I loved this drama, because the plot and obviously the way it was written, gave these short-term actors a chance to show their ability to act. And I think they made a chance for themselves as scary actors :D Well really. Sometimes I think it's a lot harder to play an ugly and unattractive, violent, screaming your lungs-off-character, rather than a smiling, coffee drinking, book reading person in a coffee shop. So I loved all of those side characters. They could even surprise me, scare me a bit, and really sometimes.. break my heart. I hope great future for any of those actors.

Then the plot. Let's give the screenwriter an applause. I was not surprised all the time. You don't have to write a screenplay, that has such twists, that I have never seen, heard.. to surprise me. The screenplay is either good or bad. It more often than not depends on how smooth the story flows. Just like when you read a book. If you stumble at every freaking step, then it's a bad book. And this was an awesome drama. I was satisfied with every part of it.

The starting made me want to see more. The continuing, from one episode to another, made me interested. The connections between the main characters were touching, and also logical. Why they, why here...
And the evil. Not just one bad, but the evil, the anger, the frustration inside people themselves, which gave them permission to take people over... Which called for that. It made sense. I liked how it was played out.
And the ending. The not sad end, which seemed perfectly logical and I did prepare for it. It felt also right. But the gently smile in the end, the quiet joy of together again... It made me happy too. So I do think, the screenwriter, did a perfect job.

I'm so happy, that they didn't create a love triangle. First, though fun and interesting, they are somewhat... in almost every Korean drama you see. And when I see them, I almost always enjoy them. But it's good to discover a drama that does not have one of those, or for that matter, no love line at all. Which.. is also good. Though not as hoped for, I was satisfied, because of the tempo of the drama, it ran so fast and so interestingly that I didn't see any reason for it.

Now the main three. The actors. They probably could have chosen a better three. But after saying this. I will say, that I don't want anyone else there. Why should I? There are not many actors with such eyes as Kim Dong Wook. At times they really seemed like the saddest, the one who had the hardest life, the one who knows it all, the one who was possessed... I absolutely love that actor now. No joyous adoring. But in skills of playing a part. This was over the top good.

Now Jung Eun Chae, was primarily interesting for me at first, because she didn't smile. Now don't get me wrong. I did think she acted great, but she was interesting to me, because I liked her frowning, and so serious and angry all the time. Her unbelieving, her hard fighting for known logic and not trusting the concept of possessions and evil as such that was shown to her. But then she made herself softer... She had a lot of hurts, she had some small smiles and she worried, for others. I loved the almost concealed really strong affection she felt for her partner and the two guys. She was like the bond in this triangle, though I do want to put that pressure on Hwa Pyung, I'm still not totally convinced I can.

Well, we can not leave out Kim Jae Wook. He was the only of the main three I had the pleasure to have seen before. I did already love his acting skills. I do have to say... I was confused for a little while. I could not find the satisfying affection for him, from the first sighting.. but it came. pretty quickly. He was a lot more confusing character than Kil Yeong. Because I could not read his emotions. I saw his anger and resentment, but I couldn't understand, why was it all concealed under such a hard face. It felt weird. It made sense soon and that was what made me appreciate the role he had been given. To play hard roles is something I do value. I think you have to see actors play both sides, from different angles to know if they are really good. (That's why everyone loves Meryl Streep, what character hasn't she yet played) So playing Choi Yoon gave me a totally new experience when I saw him on screen. He was like a beat-up child, on a street, who does not trust anyone or anything. And then he starts to trust someone, and then he discovers that he is deceived, and now he has to trust another(s). That's an immensely difficult task to do. In life, trust is not something that comes easily... to most people.

I think the three actors, in a way, were given roles, that made it immediate, that if they acted them out wrongly, it would have been clear to everyone watching this drama. And they did such a great job with all of those characters, that I think it's hard not to want to watch the drama if you're in any way in love with something thrilling and mystical and try out the first one.. maybe two episodes, then I think most people will continue.

I did love it. A lot.

Interesting watching everyone!!!

I really like thriller / horror movies so when I found it I thought I should give it a try.

The story is nice and I really liked the fact that although it's a drama it wasn't ""soft"" .Some scenes were quite realistic as well. The cast was good ( especially the priest) but I didn't really like the policewoman . I think she her acting was a little annoying in some parts.
I don't know if they are going to make a second season but to be honest I didn't really get why did Pak Il Do reach HongJoo . They were distant relatives but still I feel something is missing . I could re-watch it easily.

Not your typical kind of kdrama.
I had to summon my brave self every week to finish every episode ????????????but I like how the series feel frightening, and yet bearable to watch. (Bearable, because Father Mateo is so damn hot! Lol! *forgive me father for I have sinned* ????????)
Until the very end, i was really hoping for some romance between Hwa Pyung and Detective Kang.. ???? but sad to say NGA-NGA!!!
For me, the story doesn't only talks about exorcism itself, 'Park iL do' (the bad spirit) represents people's greed, jealousy and envy.
If you possess these three things in life, then you can never be happy and will always bring discomfort and harm to other people.

Excellent drama
Don’t hesitate to watch If you have any concerns about supernatural, here though it’s supernatural, the abilities of the evil were almost human. I really appreciate the concept of evil spirit going into and possessing the human who already have dark thoughts. This logic is very much convincing unlike “Priest”

Also how the three leads work in harmony is mind blowing.

Very gripping, though this ending is not that necessary to have season 2 as New evil spirit could be created.

Excellent Horror and Character-Driven Series
I've had this on my watchlist for ages and was putting it off because horror is not my favorite genre. However, I was bored and tried it and it's one of the best decisions I've made. The story revolves around three characters who's lives are intertwined by a horrible spirit who kills their family members. There are many reviews but I want to focus on the chemistry of the actors and how well they immersed themselves into the characters they portrayed. What makes a drama entrancing is the magic that happens when actors can bounce off of each other well and a great script. This drama has both. The supernatural was blended into the real world and the scary moments were believable. It kept me on the edge of my seat but I will say it can be emotionally tiring since the drama is in equal parts horror and drama. My favorite genre is drama and the way the characters had to push past their differences, their feelings of guilt and anger, and their loneliness in order to eventually defeat the big bad makes you root for them with all your heart. Their relationships with each other were the heart of this story. The complexity in their bonds made this drama sing. There were intimate moments where one or another character would care for the other in such loving ways. These moments were small but interspersed and made the scenes where they tried to save each other and even sacrifice themselves for another even more poignant. This is especially true between the priest and Yoon Hwa Pyung. This drama was a masterpiece and will go down as one of my favorite kdramas. Also the music was touching and perfectly matched the tension and emotion of the scenes. A+

This show is so worth watching if you are into darker and mistery themes.
Okay so let me explain... The moment I lay my eyes on the synopsis of The guest I knew that I was gonna like it, it's OCN, it's dark and has a good premise, and in the end I did. I didn't love it, I felt like I couldn't conect with the characters as much as I should've, and frankly they were pretty dumb and made me annoyed most of the time, but they weren't bad characters overall. The acting was okay, nothing too admirable but not bad, even when things could've gone wrong with all the screaming and possesions and crazyness, it never felt too over the top.
The best thing about this by far is the writing, the story is so well develop that it doesn't need a thousand plot twist to make it good to watch, for me there was only one thing that I was kind of shock the pull off but that was it, and still was worth it.
The way the relationship of the main characters was portrayed was great, at the end you felt their conection and why it was important to them. Also, each of them had their lifes, their own stories to tell, and it was made clear in how they had their solo adventures during the whole show; it was focus on what each could bring to the team more that the team alone.
Everything came together and nothing important was left in the dark, not a single loose end. You could feel that it was written with the finale in mind and all the plot was driven to that, which seems normal but it's very rare to find a drama like that. And that's why the finale it's the best, it made me tear up for characters I didn't actually care five minutes before, for characters which deaths I was okay with, and expecting, since episode 10. Even if it wasn't the real ending the whole dead scene was beautiful, I loved Hwa Pyung's sacrifice because it was closure, the thing he wanted since the beginning, to avenge; and Choi Yoon giving his life, his strength to him in a image that send me The creation of Adam's vibes broke me. It was perfect, it made sense, it felt right, the three of them in the face of death itself just like the start, so intimate and yet so powerful. And nothing changed for me when I figured that it was gonna have a happy ending, because they deserved it, it was their win and they should be happy.
In the end it's such a worthy drama to watch, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who like dark and mistery theme dramas.



Bonus: me bitching about the other drama.
This is pretty much what possesed* wanted to be, and it was faaaaaar from it. I even thought about how similar they were, I kind of acepted that this was a much better prequel. It kind of shock me.

Has Character Development Horror Movies Always Lack!
I was anxious, scared, uneasy, angry, curious, worried and sometimes heartbroken but that's what I love about this! This drama was cinematically beautiful and musically eerie from the start! The film style was like a high-budget movie and the writing was enough to captivate me from the start (with the first 2-4 episodes being the most jarring).

STORY
The fast-paced introduction full of supernatural events, religious rituals, death, fear, and mystery sets the tone for the rest of the drama. The first half involved a lot of individual cases (similar to ones in crime dramas that only last for 2 eps) to provide necessary clues in connection to the larger mystery/enemy. In the second half, there was a noticeable change from individual cases to developing the main mystery. It was a change I appreciated since single cases get very repetitive. With a larger focus on the mystery of who exactly their enemy was, the twists and turns had me switching back-and-forth between guesses.

CHARACTERS
The tragedies and resulting effects the characters experienced had me worried for their well-being and that of the people who cared for them. Each character had sufficient time spent on truly developing their character's backgrounds, personality, and psyche with the progression of events. A detail I enjoyed was how they kept true to the limitations/restraints of what Choi Yoon and Kang Gil Young could do and when because of their jobs since this bit of realism made it more believable. All the actors had an amazing portrayal of their characters and were able to convey their emotions well.

OVERALL
Quickly piquing my curiosity, I became invested in how this trio would go about avenging their families against a demonic enemy. From how these characters were written, I came to care for all of them and hoped for the best overall outcome. From start to finish, this was a wild ride and one worth being a 10/10 rating!

A little predictable and little not.
The Guest is a drama centered around three characters whose life goes through horrible change when they directly and indirectly encounter an infamous spirit Park Il Do. Years later, the trio end up meeting each other accidentally. This is a decadent horror drama for fans looking for some scary thriller. However, the first two episodes of this drama are the scariest. After the intro episodes, we do become familiar with which direction the story is going in. Though it seems predictable at various points, it does manage to keep you on your toes. My favourite part about the drama was the dynamics between the leads. From distrusting each other to working together, the bromance progresses well. The pace of the story varies as well — there are parts which are slow but the intense almost cliffhanger reveals keep you going. It’s a fun drama to watch in a group, to speculate and discuss the characters.

I usually stay away from horror movies and anything that involves demonic situations because I'm a wuss and proud of it.

I had to get myself to only watch two episodes a day. Since I had to work I had to break it up into one in the daytime and the other at night. Some episodes I wish I had waited till the daytime to watch.

I knew I was in for it after the first few episodes. They had me wanting to turn on every light in the house...heck I was even tempted to leave the refrigerator door open!

I suck at names and don't even get me started on foreign names but for some odd reason I will remember Park Il Do...Even though that name was constantly being mentioned I won't forget that name for a while.

The casts who played as if they were possessed did a phenomenal job! Especially the little girl. I was relieved to see that each child who had to endure demonic situations received proper counseling because thinking about how many takes each actor had to do over and over would have a huge impact on their mental state. I, myself, had to watch something light after each episode to keep this off of my mind. Especially when I go to bed. I didn't want that to be the last thing on my mind.

The make up and special effect scenes were spot on. It had a realness to it. I've heard of people being possessed and it's no joke!! It almost made me question whether the director and writer experienced something like this or they just did a phenomenal job in doing their research on possessions.

I did have some takeaways from this drama. As I said before I truly suck at names and foreign ones are no exception. The guy who played the young priest had no emotion AT ALL!! Plus to me, he looked too creepy to play a priest! It doesn't help that I just saw four seasons of Voice and he played the villain in the first drama. He plays creepy really well, so this priest role was truly wrong for him.
The bromance was just too light and the chemistry between the main and supporting characters was just too thin. Plus the situation between the main male lead being able to see dead people was barely touched on. We learned he had this ability when he was a kid but it was long forgotten and just added back at the 15th episode.
The story behind Park Il Do was like a run on sentence. The explanation of his existence was just thrown into a monologue in the 16th episode.

It went off as if it will continue. I don't see how it could work because it'll be like repeating the first 16 episodes all over again.

Three different people on the same mission
I'm just finishing watching this drama once again. This is the third or fourth time in the years since it was made. What captures me the most about it is the three protagonists bonded together by a common struggle. Each of them is different, original, interesting, but they all have the same thing in common - the desire to protect the other two.
The mystery element in this drama is strong, clear, and truly mysterious. The plot twists and pressure points on the various suspects are well handled. The plot keeps you in suspense. The atmosphere has the right intensity.
I especially like the relationship between shamanism and Catholicism. They were presented in quite an interesting way. But the circumstances are also interesting.
But for me, as I mentioned before, the best and most important thing is the characters. Not just the main three. Each character is very believably drawn and portrayed. But of course the main three are the best.

Darkness That Truly Shows You The Light Inside
This drama was well done. Every movement was on point by each actor who was possessed. The music suited every scene perfectly. The supporting cast was so well assigned. I was even a huge fan of how the plot unfolded and moved forward. Every time we think we found something out a new twist would arrive.

Also it’s hella creepy and dark a lot of the time. Its supernatural aspects were so well thought out and depicted. It’s not easy to give life to this much level of detail of possession and the aftermath it leaves behind.

I love how each characters relationship was well fleshed out. You grew to love every character and understand why they would go to the lengths they go. Some actions at times feel too much, but with a new perspective you understand exactly why it’s that way. There was such good friendship depicted throughout the show. Not just our mains but their familial, coworkers, and old friends.

Tears happened in this drama so often. Emotions would well up and I love when dramas evoke emotion that way. Makes it the best kind of immersion one could ask for.

I’d watch it again most definitely. Give it a shot.

The Guest is NOT welcomed in my home!!!!
I was in the mood for horror and it was creeptacular. ?

It stated off so intense and it kept peaking my interest each episode. It totally delivered with the creepiness. A lot of it was because of the lighting to set the mood, the music they would use, the camera angles, and how amazing the actors were at being freaky with their facial expressions. It was quite impressive. I loved that and I could feel creeped out watching it in the dark alone at home. That was until around the last couple of episodes when it was about to hit the climax. I became bored a bit and kind of disappointed because it was getting to a point where they were running in circles trying to rack their brains of what to do and who was the villain.

With all the gruesome things that happened, I was expecting it to go out with more of a bloody bang, ya know!
Like don't get me wrong, the story in itself was intriguing the way they were talking about this ""Guest"" thats been around for more than half a century who came from the East Seas. Like I was hoping for more of a backstory behind that. Like what is it exactly and how it came into being. Like I'm curious about things like that. It was wild how the exorcisms were performed by the priests but some of the times it took them longer to finish the exorcisms. I'm not well educated in that holy department, but it just shows how human the priests are. A lot of them aren't saints and claim to be holy and a soldier of God who go around helping people and dispel the wicked, when they themselves sin like your average joe. It seems that this type of work, one has to be physically and spiritually strong or they may end up hurting themselves or others.

The main characters or the 3-stooges as I call them, were too incoherent when it came to dealing with the issues caused by the Guest. I understand that it wasn't a coincidence that they all met again years after, and that they had a lot in common due to unfortunate events that occurred during their young lives, but I thought they would be more circumspect as adults rather than being reckless, impulsive, and foolhardy. Some of their decisions were ridiculous and I didn't see how it aided in the situation they were in. But there wasn't much teamwork to begin with since they all didn't really like or trusted each other to begin with. At least they were wary in that area. They never really stopped to really think about things but was ready to jump the gun as soon as they head the name of the Guest. ? Like why? However, as they've been though a lot in their lives together, those three developed a bond. It was of mutual interests and first but it became more than that after some time. :)
The main casts and supporting casts did a really good job. I was even amazed at the kids. Those little shits were so creepy I swear. LOL

I wanted to watch something scary. This wasn't as scary but it was very creepy, especially with the sounds effects and music. Mind you, I had the volume high on the speakers too and I was always watching it late at night in the dark alone. That's the type creepy mood I'm talking about. It was eerily intense, because while watching it felt like the characters would sometimes jump out of the screen and stand in front of you. Like no thanks. Hahaha~ The last episode was a bit lackluster for me. The mini revelation was surprising but I was wanted more... like an all out war/battle. Ok, maybe that was too much but something along those lines. Then again, it made sense that things happen the way that it did. One can never stop evil from truly disappearing. It always spurs from darkness in human hearts, and the living is a lot more scarier than the dead or unseen spirit as they say.

Would I rewatch this again? Probably not because it won't be as creepy because I will be expecting things to happen and won't be surprised or creeped out. If it's with a friend who's never seen it, then definitely.
Would I recommend this to anyone? Definitely! I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to watch this and experience the uncanny feeling that it might affect you in the real world while watching. Hehe~ Don't watch if you can't handle this type of stuff, and if you can't watch it alone, try watching with someone so you don't get nightmares while sleeping in the dark. I can't promise you won't hear incomprehensible whispers near your ears. LOL ?

My sincere advice: Humans should really consider being careful when they try to mess with things in which they do not understand and cannot handle.

I watched this drama only knowing bits about it. i was really curious of the premise. a detective, a psychic and a priest, what a strange and great combination. i am not a fan of horror, but i still expect some scary shits here as it was the genre. and it definitely gave what i needed.

the exorcisms are so intense, they are like the real horror of this film. i was holding my breath the whole time they're exorcising. i knew that light will still overcome the darkness, but the fear is still there. they did a great job building up those scenes, from the lightning, the mood and the atmosphere, even the soundtrack. it was all perfect. really, OCN's soundtracks never disappoint. just hearing the song reminds me of it like the other OCN dramas that i've watched.

tho those exorcism scenes were great, i do agree with others that this would have fit better with just 12 eps. i feel like the other exorcism scenes were mere fillers as they doesnt really connect well to move the plot.

the twist and turns definitely got me. they did a great job for those whodunnit scene, giving us mindblowing revelations and all that.

although hwa pyung is the center of this drama, he's the least that i like from the three. i just feel like he's too self-centered at some point, and too reckless. i love choi yoon and gil young very much. their characters were much interesting for me. maybe because there are a lot of stakes on Gil Young and Mateo's part. specially on Mateo. but then, their friendship was very special. i really thought it would be fine for me if one of them will have to die and sacrifice his life at the end, but when that point came, i realized that i cannot see only two of the three left. i was praying along with Mateo for all of them to be saved. like seriously hahaha.

also, special mention to Yukgwang. his friendship with Hwa Pyung is so underrated. i actually like their friendship more than Hwa Pyung and Mateo. Yukgwang never once doubted him, and even sacrificed his life for him. i hate that i know the existence of his character is only to save HP, leaving him to die just like that. he deserves more.

this film tackled religious beliefs and the Catholic religion, however, it feels lacking at times. Mateo is a priest, but i can only feel that connection that he has with God during exorcism scenes. maybe it's because as a Catholic myself, i expected more of it. i was hoping and waiting for him to pray and ask for God's help and guidance esp after he had received that prophecy in the beginning.

moving on to the finale, i certainly didnt expect father yang to die immediately, and yes it's because i thought he was park il-do. but then, if it's not him, how come that the supposed to be zombie apocalypse suddenly stop? i know it didnt fully stop, but how did they suddenly came to their senses when park il-do is alive? just to mislead the audience? one thing i noticed is that there are scenes that they put just to purposedly mislead the audience, but it doesnt make scene when that revelation came up. e.g, the above mentioned scene, park hong joo vomitting after holding the rosary, Priest Yang suddenly making people possessed after holding their hand when he's not even possessed himself, Priest Yang damaging the bible (a sign of possession accrdg to Mateo himself).

the revelation scene with HP grandfather is just so-so for me. yes, i was mind blown by them but i felt like it was spilled too much that it kinda left nothing for me to think and analyze of. maybe it's just me, too, since i prefer to connect the dots hahaha. but i wasnt swayed with the grandfather's acting. i was actually more scared of Bong Sang's possession scene than that one. and it doesnt help that it was daytime when that happened. tho that dreamy and hazy background effect that they put helped to build it up, it wasnt enough. it's not the kind of revelation scene with park il do that i expected. dont get me wrong, i really really love his grandfather and was hoping that he wont die. but his acting being park il do was just really a meh for me. also, what the hell's with that sudden cut? they had completely build up this atmosphere and then suddenly cut it, shifting it back to the real world.

there are still so many things that left me confuse. e.g. whose body is buried in their house? whose body is his grandfather digging up? why did Priest Choi said ""stay away from your son"" to HP's father when HP is not even possessed? how exactly did Park Il Do managed to brainwash Priest Yang?

having said that, the only redeeming part of the finale for me is the sea scene. i cried damn lot during those scene. i was gripping on my seat while waiting for the story to unfold. and that drowning scene of Hwa Pyung and Mateo? brilliant. i love love every bits of it. especially after seeing how Hwa Pyung wore that rosary towards the end.

despite the flaws, i actually kinda like how things wrapped up. it was not completely solved and all good, which i think, is just perfect for its genre and theme. it was a realistic as i'm sure as heck that that kind of evil sprit cant be defeated so easily. park hong joo not being caught is frustrating yes, but it was realistic as it would be hard to beat her, too. for me, the end was hinting for a second season, and at the same time just leaving something for our imagination and own interpretation.

light may have prevailed towards the end, but there will always be looming darkness, just waiting for the perfect moment to eat us alive.

this show is on lists of most recommended k-dramas everywhere for a reason, PERIODT!
wow.

where TF do i even begin to describe my admiration for this immaculate drama?!

first of all, i would never have watched this drama for its genre if not because of its title that keeps popping up on lists of most recommended k-dramas everywhere on the internet.

finally when i realise that k-drama fanatics aren't playing when most of them are agreeable in saying that this is a must watch, i relented with a heavy heart thinking 'i am doing this to tick off a to-do list. ughh it really feels like a chore, God help me'.

i remember it was around ep. 4 that i finally warmed up to the story and its lead characters, and by ep. 6, the phenomenal performance by the young possessed woman completely won me over, AND I WAS SOLD!

after that bingewatching this one after the next is a very easy thing to do, LOL.

as a little sidetrack, a new horror Netflix k-drama series, All of Us are Dead just released. i got curious about it, but sadly the review sucked. whenever considering a drama, the story is the most important thing for me, and because of that i feel like my respect and admiration for the writer-director combo for this drama has only deepened.

I'D SAY THIS IS A TRULY PHENOMENAL DRAMA ON EVERY LEVEL.

the pacing is good. mystery/suspense element is good. horror element is good. scriptwriting is excellent. directing is outstanding. casting, chemistry and acting, phenomenal. wow!

i feel the possessed people were build or progressed in a way that they become creepier and unexpected as the story goes on. and as someone who really do not watch this genre almost at all, i can still feel the shiver inside my chest just thinking about them LOL.

also, the finale. i was a bit lost about what happened in the last exorcism scene between Mateo and Hwa Pyung but someone in the comment section clarified that part for me so i'm all good now, haha. i was about to minus 0.5 points if they ruined the ending, kekeke.

WHAT A TRUE MASTERPIECE. this drama truly converted me for its genre and i'm so freaking glad i gave this a chance.

also, the trio's friendship truly warms my heart. i can't wait to rewatch this masterpiece again in the future.

signing out. ^^

I truly enjoyed this drama. I finished it in about a week, and each episode left me eager for the next one. This drama is what The Ghost Detective tried and failed to be: an excellent thriller/horror. The tension was never lost, because the threat of Sohn was ever present, even if he himself was not, hounding the protagonists while they searched for a way to destroy him. There were new threats each episode, as Sohn sent various demons after the main leads in order to impede their progress. The plot twists, all except for one (which I shall touch upon), were excellent. The story kept me on my toes.

*spoilers below*

If this drama had one flaw, it is that it tried to be too clever. The big mystery that the protagonists were trying to figure out was who Sohn was possessing. Was it Matthew's brother, Sang Hyun? Was it Father Yang? Was it Hwa Pyung's father or his grandfather? Was it the politician, Park Hong Joo? Was it Hwa Pyung all along? Honestly, the options that I had held out for was either Sang Hyun, Hong Joo, or Hwa Pyung himself. I especially hoped it would be Hwa Pyung, because they kept hinting that Sohn had been hiding inside him all along, biding his time. Which made the final episode rather disappointing, because it turns out...*dramatic pause*...it was the grandfather all along, and Hwa Pyung never was actually possessed. Uh...? Okay?

The final episode was actually a big disappointment after all of the excellence that came before it. It was extremely badly paced, with nearly 20 minutes of the grandfather/Sohn monologuing and ret-conning almost all of what we were led to believe since episode one. Then there was the chase from Hwa Pyung's house to the beach, a distance which should take maybe 40-50 minutes because the beach can clearly be seen from the house, but gauging by the how the sun is high in the sky at the start, and it is full night when they reach the beach, takes more than 6 hours. I liked the last 20 minutes of the episode, but the first 2/3 of the episode was just really, really bad.

If it had been up to me, the last episode would have gone thus:

Hwa Pyung brings his grandfather home from the hospital, and all seems to be well. Then, Hwa Pyung feels the pain in his right eye again, and he realizes that Sohn did not die. Sohn temporarily takes control of Hwa Pyung's body and forces Hwa Pyung to kill his own grandfather. Hwa Pyung regains control and manages to carve the containment symbols into his own skin. Matthew and Gil Young arrive to find him like that. Matthew attempts to exorcise Sohn from Hwa Pyung, but partway through the exorcism, Matthew suffers excruciating pain (due to the curse), and Sohn breaks free and attacks. Gil Young tries to stop him, but Sohn has inhuman strength and knocks her away. Hwa Pyung barely manages to resurface before Sohn kills Matthew, and flees down towards the beach.

From here, the episode plays out the way they wrote it, though, my final complaint is that it would've been nice if they had clarified that Matthew's curse disappeared when Sohn died, rather than just showing that he's fine a year later.

okay,so even though i haven't finished watching this drama but still i thought it was important to write a review on it.first of all the story-it was awesome.I usually don't watch all the episodes of a drama in one go.but this story was so interesting that as i had finished watching one episode i was curious about the next episode or what happens next.it had basically everything i wanted-horror,suspense,flirting,bromance etc. now the only thing i want is a happy ending (if not possible a satisfying ending or an ending that makes sense)

acting-acting wise i thought every actor did their best. no one seemed stiff.even the child actors nailed it.chemistry wise the main three actors were good. i loved how their relationship gets better as the story goes on .

music-well,i usually tend to concentrate on the drama instead of music or ost. but the osts of this drama made it easier for me to feel the horror,suspense etc.so,i loved it.

rewatch value-definitely,i will watch it again. since the episodes are still airing so after all the episodes are aired i will watch it again. but can't tell about the third or fourth time because i usually don't watch a drama more than twice unless i am carving for the moments.

overall-i am not a regular horror watcher.but i still gave it a try and i am glad that i did. so ,if you still don't know if you should watch it or not definitely give it a shot.i believe you won't be disappointed.

Great story but too many holes
Ok, so first I watched a lot of ghost, spirit, horrors movies/tv shows. The story is original and it tied the 3 main characters pretty well.
First episode set the drama in a gore/horror atmosphere that won’t last. Other episodes until 9, were pretty slow to me and repetitive.

When I watch a movie/tv show, I’m pretty picky about the characters. The story can be simple, not elaborated, revisited, it won’t bother me as long as characters have some depth. In this drama, the characters communicate 80% of the time by yelling. I find that emotions aren’t right ..... Hwa-Pyung and the inspector are just 2 angry people acting recklessly and doing whatever they want, when they actually don’t have any power to stop possession or to stop Park Il Do! The only one who actually shows diverse emotions is the priest, Choi Yoon. And during all this screaming .... it seems they are all alone in public places as no one reacts or does wayyy too late. There are also some inconsistencies in the story that made me sigh a little. Episode 1, Hwa-Pyung can see ghosts before being possessed, yet every single time he explained his link with Park Il Do, he says he’s like this since he was possessed.

I’m at episode 10, skipped some episodes as some are very slow and yet I still can follow the storyline.
There is more mystery around the priest and evolution in his character, this is why you’ll keep watching it. I hope it will get better and better as I had high expectations for this drama, and so far it didn’t meet them

Overall an easy watch (almost too easy) and not frightening at all if you're into horror and thriller. The gore is at a medium amount, and much of it is censored. Some of the acting from the minor characters is incredibly stale and overdone. Plus, there's a lot of filler dialogue that may have you falling asleep.

The main male lead is quirky, comical, and the actor who plays him does an amazing job at bringing his character to life. The young priest appears to have no emotions (verbally and physically) and barely moves his neck and limbs, making his character unrealistic and lacklustre. (Could be interpreted as stoic.) The female lead is strong, and she has a masculine beauty that is enthralling to watch, however, her character is far too stubborn and avoids believing the truths that are right in front of her, only for a plot device (to continuously create an uneasy dynamic between her and the male leads).

Rarely any jump scares, but the few that are there are incredibly successful. The cinematography is visually pleasing and consistent, but sometimes the shaky cam is too noticeable and appears cheap. In general, it's fun to watch, but it could have been executed and written much better.

Gripping
Wasn't until the very last few episodes that I realised who the demon was in. So many possibilities and the writer did well to conceal it whilst taking us through multiple possessions and torment.
It is quite a scary story at times with mild gore... tbh I prefer horrors that are psychologically frightening, relying on atmosphere and tension, as opposed to gallons of blood and guts.
Loved the cast and most characters.
Sometimes a few of the smaller support characters were a bit overacted. I also found the constant doubts toward one another's advice and thoughts, by the main 3, a bit irritating at times (mostly further into series, when ecperiences should have taught them better). Plus, they individually went into situations, alone, when anyone in their right mind would have held off.
I liked the soundtrack too and found a scene in the last ep quite moving.
As there was often a lot going on in terms of a shifting demon and its side stories, I think it would also make a decent rewatch, which I might one day, with a friend :~)

How am I going to start writing review of this drama? I seriously do not know. It took me more than half an hour to come up with some ideas.

Firstly, the story does not at all fall into the category of typical horror genre. I was bit aversive at the beginning about whether to start it or not; however, I do not regret at all because it is ravishingly well made. This is the first time I am watching any drama genre which has given a completely different message using horror-thriller concept. Maintaining an aberrant concept with spirits/ghosts/any supernatural being to portray an underlying perfidiousness of mankind expresses perfect erudition of the writers.

One harbinger, one priest and a detective - are the three unfortunate people- relatively of same age are the three main characters of this drama. Through thick and thin and utter turmoil they fought with the unknown iniquitous power which has the ultimate target to make the entire human race its sycophant. During the time of atrocity, corruption or belligerence or in general during the weakest time of a human, when their morality dwindles, integrity shaken and corruption becomes rampant that’s when this invisible being becomes supremely powerful. Thus it possesses people claiming it would chew his/her heart, making them torpid and would take full control of their soul. The portrayal is rather a complex one enough to give the viewers harrowing feeling yet the charm of the story is simply ineluctable. Although many macabre scenes may produce nausea but it is a kind of masterpiece that has one prime message to deliver.

Upon hearing quite a number of dialogues regarding pinpointing at the facinorous characteristics of human, I became quite doubtful about what they want to depict. It is not at all an usual one. Never have I seen any dramas of this genre possessing deep edification. Everything became clear when the writers' thoughts have been expressed as an epilogue at the end of the finale episode. Following is what they said, “The guest tried to look at the problems in our society through another perspective. All bad things eventually start from the heart of people, and this is what we wanted to depict. They say humans are the most frightening beings. Just like the viewers called Yun Hwa Pyung “Yun Peace”, we hope all viewers find peace of mind”.

Apparently, though all the episodes are petrifying but if can be concentrated past the horror scenes, viewer can find the vehemence the writers depicted on the dark psychology of humans. As they have said it is simple, a person’s unscrupulous acts submerge them into intense evil. Thus the weakest heart full of malevolence would subject to debacle.

From the beginning till end the story, acting of the ensembles, cinematography, cliff hangers, OSTs and most importantly the pace are extremely intriguing. Chill would run down one’s spine still one would be glued to his/her sit. Guaranteed. All credit and a huge round of applause should go to the ensembles for doing marvelous job of frightening us even in the broad day light. Moreover, I cannot eulogize the directors enough for their meticulous and well thought out direction and the writers for presenting us a discerning story through the lens of supernatural action/thriller. In one word the drama is enigmatic yet the message it holds is explicable.

OCN always present us the darkest, most sombrous dramas with captivating plot twists. I cannot say much due to the fear of giving out spoilers. So, if you do not want to live in quandary and quench your utter dismay you should go and watch it.

A GREAT SERIES AND WILL ALWAYS KEEP YOU WANTING FOR MORE
I accidentally stumbled upon this series while I look for Korean series on Netflix and I am so glad that I gave it a shot as I am always into horror/possession/exorcism genres.

I really appreciate how they did not try to insert a love story plot in this story. Every episode always kept me on edge and it also makes me think on how things will unfold. The casts has an unbelievable great chemistry.

After watching this series, I can't get the name Park Il-Do out of my head. I hope that there will be more Korean series of this genre in the future

This drama is really not a joke. It was very well made and everything was pretty much on point. The acting was good, the scenes brought out strong emotions and the story had a very nice way of unraveling, one episode at a time. It's the kind of drama that lingers on you for a long time even after the final credits have rolled.

You will encounter a lot of gore and unpleasant scenes. If you are sensitive to people stabbing themselves, eating their own limbs, hanging themselves or other goreful activities, DON'T watch this.

There is no romance. The main characters will slowly get closer but it's all in a nightmare like fight to avenge their families and each other.

This is not a light watch. It is bingable but it's not something you'd watch to feel happy. The story is very dark, sad and deep and plays a lot on the negative elements and emotions of people.

The acting was great and the story was interesting. Although one or two episodes felt a bit draggy, every single episode was an important part of the unraveling of the mystery. I love how they never once left the main road, instead we watched things happen on the road side and each happening was a sign, telling us where to turn next.

BUT NO DRAMA IS PERFECT.

The ending was not to my liking. To be honest, I had worked out, what I thought was a great theory, but in the end I was wrong and I'm okay with that as long as you give me something better. Instead, I felt like the writers randomly added an extra plot twist, just because, and then filmed a few extra scenes to back up their new change of course. I would have forgiven them for that if they had not ruined the potential of a brilliant ending in the next set of scenes! This is the only part of the story where the writers broke their own rules and the laws of nature just to have a happy ending which is why this drama is not a 10.

ENJOY!!!

GREAT WATCH FROM A HORROR LOVER
What a great piece! The chemistry of the cast, the story, the acting, especially the script! I love all of it! As a horror/thriller lover I've had a hard time searching for good dramas with this kind of concepts and I'm so thankful that I didn't hesitate watching this as soon as I've found it! It's freaking great! Also with the casts acting and hard work especially at the last battle scene I probably won't be able to move on from this for a couple of months!
one of the best drama I've watch from 2018!

Only at episode 6 and I’m already writing a review simply because I am completely blown away by this series to date. Fresh storyline with good chemistry across the cast except maybe 1 or 2 minor roles.

The poignant scene where the 3 protagonists come together at the scene of the crime is well staged and played out. Also, The scene where the female cop cried when she related the cause of her mum’s death to her colleague really caught me...a sort of a bittersweet closure.

Onwards to the rest of the series!

P.s does anyone know where this show is filmed? I love the psychic’s grandpa’s house

One of the best dramas
In my opinion this is one of the best crime and paranormal dramas.
The drama is quite scary, especial the first episode, when they show what happened in the past.
As it progresses the drama also becomes quite emotional, and here the OST plays a big role. Somewhere is a very emotional song and it is played during the most important scenes.
The actors did their job very well. The most I liked Choi Yoon aka Father Mateo. I think Jae Wook did a great job in his character portrayal. Father Mateo impressed me the most because he was deeply hurt by what happened to his family, yet he was calm and considerate. It was touching how he protected Mi Jin's son from seeing his dead mother in episode 7, also how he took care of Seo Yoon. How he tried to protect her when the door opened and she got possessed, also how she treated her after, during her exorcism and after she was exorcised. Was impressive how she was sleeping on him when they were taking her home and how he was holding her hand. Felt like he took a special care of her. I think they have potential as a duo for a second season in which she chases spirits and he exorcises them. Also in last episode he was ready to die to save Hwa Pyeong when they were both in water. I think he also softened Gil-Young, by helping her understand that Hwa Pyeong also has his wounds. Hwa Pyeong was more reckless, but he was also ready to sacrifice himself to save Mateo. This was also impressive. However I think Father Mateo is one of the best characters i saw in a drama.

Another OCN masterpiece.
The story of three people affected by a cursed, demonic spirit. I know it's just two episodes so far but I'll alter my review accordingly. Just thought someone should say it, that I'm a huge Jaewook fan so him being in something is enough but this show has the same darkness of Voice and Save Me, my favorite kind of show. It's pure horror though, and so poignant and thoughtful.
The first two episodes dealt with some past background and current time victims of the same demon.

Weirdest show out of the bunch of kdramas I've watched, but not in a very bad way. Story progresses quick, but I think I've dropped this for now in the middle of the 'slow point' of the show. I think what made me not that interested was the female lead being kind of annoying, me wanting the priest to be the main character, and the mc being kind of bland. Some people say that being able to predict the ending of something means the author has written their story well, but for this specific show, I'd say that it's not the good kind of prediction. The one thing that I can be overly positive about is that all the actors in the show are amazing at their job; especially the people playing the possessed.

Unpredictable and totally unexpected.

It has proved my expectation completely wrong. Apparently many viewers would guess everything wrong from the very beginning and could base their judgement on mere heinous homicides committed by some callous serial murderers; however, it is beyond some grotesque serial murder cases.

The psychological aspect of the drama would hit anyone harder though there will be many questions which would be left unanswered as there are considerable number of loopholes in the story. Chill ran down my spine when the last scene was shown. Many things became clear like crystal.

This drama to my view is loosely based on the insecurity or complexities of a human mind depicted on the novel, The Metamorphosis written by Franz Kafka. After I studied a little about the pshycoanalysis of it many things got even clearer.

Firstly, a human behavior is largely dependent on their surroundings. Everyone has both sides - good and evil. Depending on the situation and the outside elements of the surrounding environment where a person constantly comes in contact, provokes him/her to act in a certain way which might lead to cognitive dissonance if being exposed to too much negativity for a longer time. In many cases they fail to understand why they are acting in a certain way they are acting or it ignites certain personalities in a human which was always hidden or his/her consciousness doesn’t allow them to express or reveal it. They cannot keep it hidden when faced with certain circumstances.

Secondly, different neurotic aspects such as anxiety, paranoia, schizophrenia which all sprouted from poverty, low income, low social status, unemployment and dissatisfactory life would also result a person become gradually hysteric or cynical. They would create a nuisance with simple issue which in the first place was never a grave issue to begin with. We all go through many phases in life where we think diabolically and imagine some gruesome thing to happen to the thing or person we abominate the most. Nevertheless we refrain from conducting such behavior due to our conscience. But what if we lose our self control or conscientiousness? Are we going to change into a devil then? “Strangers from Hell” is the literal portrayal of our intense inner negative thoughts.

The story might be unrealistic yet the caliginous psychological aspect is the reality within us which mostly goes unspoken. Human beings are the scariest – that was the main theme. Our mind always get stuck in the fact that some invisible being would scare the soul out of us but how dangerous human can be we forget many a times. No wonder the insanely eerie expressions and feeling every character of the studio exuded was utterly frightening.

The casts are in one word P H E N O M E N A L. Im Si Wan has done a tremendous job as if he has a Phd on acting. The way he walked, eat, breathe, his facial expression in every incident, in every encounter with his costars, his spooky laughter, each and every little act was beyond perfection. He deserves a best actor award in this year. His performance was above effortless and natural.

The OSTs are also excellent. All of them displayed the right mood set by the story.

I wanted to rate it 9.5 but I won’t because there are few terrible loopholes which weakens the story in certain part.

All in all it is spectacular. Watch till the end. You would not regret.

A masterfully made drama about insanity
I wrote this review in response to the underwhelming attention this show was getting. As a serious movie and TV show addict, having seen literally 1000s of shows from around the world, trust me, this show is a master piece.

Let me start of by saying, this show creeps me out, but in a way that leaves me wanting to know more. It isn't a supernatural horror show, but it sure feels like it. From the dark dingy rooms, to the close ups of the mad faces of the housemates, this show plunges the viewer into a world of madness the likes of which I have never experienced in a Korean drama before. I would dare say that some parts of the show remind me a little bit of 'The Shining', which is definitely high praise.

The acting quality by pretty much all the cast members are top notch, especially Im Si-wan, who literally nails every scene he is in, allowing viewers to relate to him and feel for him. Lee Dong‑wook also did a stellar job in breaking out of the stereotypical handsome guy roles, proving that he has what it takes to be a really f**cked up bad guy.

But I don't want to just praise the two leads, because each and every one of the tenants of Eden Studio performed wonderfully. It is their chemistry that left me in awe and made me want to keep coming back for more.

From a storytelling point of view, all the characters have interesting and distinct personalities that make you want to know more about their past and how they became the way they were. The pace is reasonably slow, but the fact that the show is only 10 episodes long made it a lot easier for viewers to stay interested. The plot is well spaced, though there are some loose ends that could have been tied up before the finale. Nonetheless, I was still left smiling when the show ended, even watching through the entire credit sequence (if you never do this, do it for this show, trust me).

But what truly hooked me was the music and cinematography. Part of the reason I enjoy Korean dramas is because of the masterful combination of music and video that one usually only sees in the theater. Well, this show featured a great combination of heavy music (both the rock and hip hop kind) that fit the dark theme of the movie. The cinematography is as expected from an OCN ""Dramatic Cinema"" show, very high end.

TLDR: I'll be honest, I was expecting a horror show with some jumpscares here and there. What I got was something far better than that. I got a show for true horror/thriller fans who want to experience claustrophobia and paranoia all in on go, and then just get their mind blown at the end.

Trust me, watch the show. You won't regret it.

Wow just wow. I finished watching this drama within a day, and all I can say is wow.

I'm a firm believer that all humans are innately bad which is the main theme for this drama. The portrayal in this drama might be over the top but it conveyed the message well.

The cast did an outstanding job in playing their characters. Especially, Lee Dongwook and Im Siwan. Their smiles were so cynical that it will give you the creeps. Also, I think it was my first time to feel nauseated by watching a scene. I think I won't be able to look at raw red meat the same way again.

In all honesty, I'm still speechless as I've only finished this drama less than 20 minutes ago and the thing that is really at the top of my mind is that I need to watch or read or hear something that will make me happy. I crave for happy thoughts. That's how dark this drama is.

The creepiest, most disturbing, most terrifying study of the human mind!
Finally a drama made me write a review and this one deserves all the golden stars.

The story keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat and keeps you guessing all the way through. The ominous atmosphere makes you feel like something terribly bad is going to happen any second. This drama studies human mind in such a terrifying and fascinating way.
Acting is top-notch! I checked this drama out purely because I love Lee Dong Wook and think he's the most beautiful man alive but I'd never seen this side of him before and I'm so glad I have now. This became my new favorite roll of his. All the actors in this drama knocked it out of the park.
The OST fits perfectly and even though I prefer OST pt. 1 by The Rose, I truly love and enjoy all the four songs.
Strangers from Hell is in my opinion a perfect gateway drug into dramaland for any lover of true crime or creepy psychological stuff in general. WE NEED MORE DRAMAS LIKE THIS!

A Journey Into The Hellish Depths of Horror And Loneliness...
There’s no denying that Strangers From Hell is possibly one of the few and most disturbing psychological dramas that South-Korea has ever produced to date with actual investment and creativity over scenes and lighting, as well as quite bloodthirsty scenes in later episodes.

Based upon the eponymous webtoon, Strangers From Hell’s title and concept is taken from a very famous play, No Exit ( 1944)by a French existentialist called Jean Paul Sartre. The play focuses upon three people who are trapped in “ Hell” which exits as a single room, and as they grow gradually sickened by the torment of one another’s company, one of the individuals realises on stage that “ Hell is other people”.

Yet Strangers From Hell isn’t a drama about three individuals stuck in one room. Instead, it is rather a focus upon our main lead Yoon Jong- Woo ( Im Siwan)’s gradual descent into madness after moving into the mysterious Eden Complex in Seoul; a cheap apartment with creepy residents and in particular, falling into the mysterious trap of the charismatic psychopath Seo Moon- Jo ( Lee Dong Wook) . Whilst not unexpected due to Im Siwan’s previous roles , it was certainty a surprising shift since his renowned role in the slice of life and business drama Misaeng, to see Im Siwan tackle a darker and more disturbing role in a psychological horror drama. Undeniably Im Siwan was brilliant within portraying the very slow mental decay of his character by the show exposing dark revelations of Jong- Woo’s past. This role was parallel to the surprising choice of typically typecast romance drama actor Dong Wook , who undeniably went beyond expectations within portraying the sheer complexity and charisma of his psychopathic role as Moon- Jo.

On the other hand, it can’t be sugarcoated that Strangers From Hell’s pacing could have been quicker or the episode lengths reduced. This isn’t to say that the show should have been constantly bloodthirsty or violent as it was part of the suspense to feel unease at what would happen next to our tragic lead, however, by the midway point ( before the ending), the drama often felt a little dragging upon focusing on one element of the story at a time. There’s obviously nothing wrong with doing this, but thus did mean there were a couple of really nuanced plot inconsistencies which were left out ( such as security cameras, suspensions and criminal records) which would have added more realism to some of the tackled scenarios.

Yet despite this, the one element of the show which must be given full praise for ( in addition to the fairly good OST, with The Rose track Strangers adding to the eeriness of the drama) , was the creativity behind the scenes and lighting. There was nothing glamourised nor glossy about the image of the apartment complex or even Jong- Woo’s workplace. It was eerily drab; adding to a later epiphany for viewers that Jong- Woo’s true hell began even before moving into the apartment complex in his hellish everyday life . ( E.g. his “ busy” girlfriend who dismisses his ridiculous claims about the residents and is nearly always at work, his arrogant old friend and boss who constantly undermines him as being worthless, his haughty colleagues as well as his fellow cadets during his time in the army ).

The finale of Strangers From Hell was certainly a surprisingly one, yet nonetheless fitting for its genre and deeper intrinsic philosophical questions of our main lead’s Hellish experiences. Whilst the drama was flawed by certain aspects of pacing and plot inconsistencies, the cast helped to realistically flesh out the characters on screen through their performances, the story was certainly intriguing and disturbing of a man just pushed too far by his experiences and it was overall a very good Psychological - Horror. It is easy to see why this show has earned its status as a cult-classic , and certainly worth a watch.

Strangers from hell is bold. The themes it delves into and its unorthodox out of norm storytelling establishes it as perhaps one of the most experimental korean dramas ever.

Its a must watch for any psychological enthusiasts. Its littered with subliminal messages and symbolises throughout.

Story: First of, the story is absolutely flawless. Watching the main character slowly descend into the depths of madness as his deranged compulsions are motivated by the main villian. The writing here is insanely well done.
The show isnt over indulgent nor is it pretentious. All the set pieces are handled perfectly.

The ending aswell, without any spoilers, leaves much upto viewer interpretation. Many conclusions are feasible with this open ended plot.

Soundtrack: The soundtrack, nothing short of perfect. Its immersive, with theme sending shivers down my spine days after finishing the show. It fits perfectly with the eerie paranomical style of the movie.

Acting: The actors absolutely killed it. Lee Dong Wook nailed his role as the psychopathic serial killer, and i would expect nothing else from the highly acclaimed actor. But the one who shines the most here is the mc, Im Shi Wan. His potrayal of a man at the brink of insanity, while being reserved and submissive is oscar worthy.

The whole cast overall did an extremely good job here. All played their roles really well, and I dont think anyone else but them could've executed it better.

Directing/Visuals: Another aspect where Strangers From Hell shows excellence. All the scenes, be it the outdoors or inside the residence where shot with alot of care no doubt. Especially with the frequent use of tracking shots and well placed cuts, the momentum is never lost.

Overall, Stranger From Hell is masterclass in storytelling. With a solid soundtrack and a wonderful cast, it is nothing short of a masterpiece.

First of all, I did not expect this drama to turn out the way it did. I guess I expected more philosophical, light musings on human nature and less gore? But it still turned out pretty well.

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I think what bothered me the most through every episode was this feeling that something was lacking. I can pinpoint it down to the cinematography and the camera angles at times, as well as this feeling that the producers didn't want us to take this drama too seriously.

For example, the scene where the camera revolves 360 degrees around Jong Woo and Mun Jo looked like bad CGI and just took out the enjoyment of it. This kind of revolving happened 2 or 3 times and was off putting. The scenes with the pervert confronting Jong Woo or vice versa were kinda disappointing after the first time.

The story itself felt outrageous at times, as if the writers had deliberately aimed at shattering any suspension of disbelief the viewers might entertain. I mean, the building owner Bok Soon has a history of odd deaths all around her and nobody found it suspicious except the lone local policewoman? A detective goes missing and nobody blinks an eye? People (like the reporter) get killed or kidnapped in broad daylight or in busy places and no witnesses? There are other buildings around Eden Studio, and no still no one sees anything? What about that church lady? What happened to her? What about that other lady who made predictions? Did she die? I was also surprised when Jong Woo didn't notice the other twin go missing (also dead). It really bothered me when no one asked after the other twin.

I wanted Mun Jo to have some real background, and the lone twin as well. All characters except Im Si Wan's felt one dimensional, perhaps because there's only ten episodes.

THINGS I LIKED:
The ACTING OH WOW! Im Si Wan has outdone himself, and Lee Dong Wook as well. I utterly fell in love with Im Si Wan's facial expressions and his inner struggle that one could see in his eyes. I loved the creepy smiles he threw in episodes and the times he would break down and look like a baby about to cry. I thoroughly enjoyed Lee Dong Wook's expressions, the curve of his lips, the death and mirth in his eyes. The creepy pervert guy and the sniggering twin were also portrayed extremely well.

The psychological and philosophical angle of the story was very good. The drama shows us various kinds of 'good' and 'bad' and how these often blend or tend to make little hierarchies in our minds. For example, the bullying that Jong Woo's girlfriend and Jong Woo himself faced at the office was done in these civilized, professional environments but caused a lot of emotional damage to the victims. How is it any better than physically hurting or killing people? Can emotional trauma be taken less seriously than physical trauma? Especially if the former leads to the latter? I liked how the drama showed that nobody took Jong Woo's distress seriously, and he never truly sought professional help for what went down in his army days. All the little things added up like dominos and led to the eventual end that the drama came to. I also liked the hints towards Kafka's Metamorphosis: a person dedicates his whole life working and working and working, and yet is treated like trash in the end. Jong Woo and his girlfriend are prime examples of modern Korean (in face the modern world's) condition. You work your way to death, and you remain poor, unhappy, unappreciated and unloved, yet you're supposed to smile and bow and say 'thank you'. Gregor Samsa laid down and died when nobody wanted him around, but Jong Woo retaliated and fought back. Is Jong Woo really the bad guy?

For me, these deeper messages of the drama trump the complaints I had with it, and so the 8.5 rating.

I expected to like this one more and it probably deserves a higher rating but it was just missing ""something"".

It was captivating early on and they paid attention to details with the environment which is key. The acting was fantastic for almost all of the actors, especially for Lee Dong Wook's character, as he was very believable in his charismatic role. And while it wasn't overly gory, let's just say munching on snacks was fine but I didn't choose to eat a hearty meal while watching this.

Although it was only ten episodes, it felt longer. Not because scenes were dragged on, but because some of the episodes just didn't add much depth. They did provide some background on the residents but not enough to empathize much with anyone. It barely touches the complexity of a human mind and it doesn't take you through the journey of how everyone became who they are. Because of this, the ending felt rushed and it didn't trigger much emotions.

Nevertheless, I still quite enjoyed it for its suspense and those strange residents no one should ever have to live with.

i think this was my first drama to finish in under 24h? i see why though. it's hard not to keep watching. i'll probably rewatch it a hundred times over, and here's why you should too:

s t o r y :
the idea behind SFH is absolutely mind blowing! the concept of a person having to stay near dangerous people because they don't have any other choice was done many times before, but this is the first time i'm seeing this kind of take on it. the way this drama shows the dark and sinister sides of people left me obsessed and i ESPECIALLY like all of the subtle hints and metaphors that were dropped each episode. (slight spoiler; i immediately realized what moon jo's goal was when they showed him reading metamorphosis) and i hope to see even more hints when i re-watch the show. there were a few plot holes that bothered me regarding the landlady but i won't get into the spoilers. all in all, i really enjoyed the story and i think it was amazingly done.

a c t i n g / c a s t :
the acting is what i liked the most in this show because it was absolutely legendary. from the facial expressions, the tone in a voice, mannerisms and the looks in their eyes, i absolutely loved the cast work in SFH. at moments, the actors made scenes so real and i could feel the fear in the atmosphere. especially pointing out seo moon jo's absolutely horrendous facial expressions that left my blood run cold. i didn't really like the girlfriend's acting though. even for someone who is portraying a ''normal'' character, she just kinda seemed detached from the story. (and i'm definitely not hating on her, i think she could do a really good job in another genre, but horror doesn't really suit her)

c h a r a c t e r s :
i hated ji eun. she was just a trashy girlfirend who ignored every red flag she was presented with and would play the victim for having a hard job.
i really enjoyed jung woo and the way his character morphed throughout the story and slowly fell into the mindset we saw when the show ended. seo moon jo is a special case too, he managed to creep the shit out of me but make me love him at the same time and i admittedly shipped the two just a little. the twins, the pervert and ofc the landlady were really fckn creepy and memorable. kang sun won and so jung hwa were my precious babies of the show, and i pretty much hated all the background characters.

m u s i c :
i rated this lower because i'm salty that the official OST is literally just 4 songs.
although it doesn't even last 15 minutes, i really liked the edgy vibes it gave off. my favorite is definitely the rose - strangers and room no. 303. check them out even if you decide not to watch this drama. you won't regret it!


!! s p o i l e r a r e a !! (the little details i enjoyed)
a) ''honey'' need i say more
b) how does that hole in the wall even work?
c) when bok-soon was picking what knife she'll use in episode 10, they literally only censored the knife she chose. it was so fucking hilarious because you get this huge row of knives and a blur in the middle
d) cleaning dust, jung woo edition.
e) the meat-
f) yall remember when kang sun asked about why moon jo wears long sleeves in the summer, and he responded he has a scar to cover? am i just dumb or did they just never elaborate on that? i really wanna know more about that so if anyone knows please tell me!

--
all in all, i really liked it (duh) just remember that if you watch it on netflix, moonjo isn't saying ''babe'' - he's saying ''honey'' literally wtf is that translation-

Explores themes of loneliness, gaslighting, the pressures of conforming in society, of social hierarchies, of the weight of expectations, of the urge to build comforting relationships & of insanity and how easy it is to slip down into the darkness when all the touchstones keeping a person sane or normal begin to fall apart.

And all wrapped up in an excellent horror show that ups the fear & creep factor to eleven using clever directing, music but especially character work. Every actor here is excellent and whilst Im Siwan & Lee Dong Wook are the obvious stars, the supporting cast are all so real and well portrayed that you'll completely fall into the show from the moment it starts.

I dare anyone not to binge watch, it's impossible! And at 10 episodes it's tightly plotted too with it never suffering the kdrama problem of having a slow middle. Then again, whilst I wouldn't say the middle was slow, I did find myself a little bored through certain scenes in the first half. Maybe I wasn't emotionally attached enough or maybe I was just waiting for the set-pieces to arrive.

Overall though every episode left me running to watch the next one and watching the whole thing was as frustrating & heartbreaking as it was fascinating & captivating.

Highly recommend for lovers of horror, crime & dark shows. Also for anyone who loves shows that are a little deeper or heavier with heaps of symbolism and clever writing thrown in.

painfully slow and boring
the acting is absolutely top notch, the production value is all there, and thats about it. the material here is barely enough for a 2 hour movie, having this stretched out over 10 episodes is simply painful.
i assume this is a problem inherited directly from the webtoon. while i havent read the source material for this show, webtoons in general tend to be paced... badly, to say the least, and profit from some very aggressive restructuring in adaptation.
the idea seems interesting, if only the execution could be at least decent.
i wouldnt recommend this to anyone.

it could've been better
the drama started out interesting, but the middle part was empty, repetitive and boring.. I always say shorter dramas don't get 16eps just because the producers know they can't drag it for that long.. basically, a movie or 4 eps would've been enough...
the acting was PHENOMENAL from everyone.. I think they all portrayed their characters perfectly, and I think they alone carried this show.. but they also felt like, puppets? the writer didn't let them reach their potential...
and beside the main ""group"" the rest of the characters were empty fillers..
the gore and graphicness of this was, funny.. they promised a 19+ last ep and they still blurred the tiny knives and blood splatter.. and the fight scenes looked over dramatic to the point it was comical? also I think the writing was weak too.. by the last ep everyone just started to feel forcibly flat, like the writer just wanted to wrap everything up in a little bow for his own perfect ending..

The ost was another beautiful thing about this drama, it was perfectly hunting and mesmerizing..

Noh Jong Hyun stole the show for me.. among psychopaths, there needs to be something you can connect with. also that last friend, he was a hero :)


my rewatch values are always a 1 or 10 and I don't think this needs anther watch..

It's a rare type of Horror kdrama that Don't rely on ghosts or unnatural strength but they are really scary, it horror but not empty plot it have good point and it took that ""humans are scary being"" in a series note. and success in doing it. and even drag it to the disgusting level not just horror easily . all the character are scary in a different way and This what made the drama distinctive and give it strength. even in that moments when you feel tired in the half part from watching repeat murders/ torture. the characters hold you down bc you want to watch them more and what they will do. i wish i know more about their past put it's true that it didn't fit in the drama to tall stores.

the acting was great and if we going to give credit between plot or acting in this drama although the plot was good, the acting was the best in this drama, everyone portrayed his character perfectly, they amazed me by there acting skills.

Cinematography i think they did good in using that studio with narrow and suffocating rooms and their best was the lead dreams, i think they could do better in filming the murders it self, i didn't notice the music that much in this drama.

i like what they did in the ending it's really fit well with the story the drama build from the start and how the Mental control is the main force in moving everything and making the world around the person. "" WE AREN'T STRANGERS, THE PEOPLE AROUND US MAKE US STRANGERS"" not only the Eden Studio and Moon Jo was part of Jong woo' end but everyone> his gf(that never believed him), his office collage, his army days and the irresponsible police in his country.

Im Shi Wan / Yoon Jong Woo really did great job it was the first time i watch him and he amazed me he descript every emotion so well i fell to him. Lee Dong Wook / Seo Moon Jo never thought he can be scary character he is great actor for sure.
it's not something i can enjoy if i re-watch it's onetime drama that lose it's power after you know everything. Over all this drama did so well in it's Genres i give it 8.5

I really expected a great drama. But no, I only felt bored. I was skipping 10 seconds for the sake of finishing this.

My expectation- gore, bloody, scary, disturbing and chilling (if this is the right term). IT. WAS. NOT. I watched this around 1am-3am or 4 but I did not feel scared at all. The only time I felt disturbed is when they ate raw meat.

The drama was very slow. I was expecting something right off at ep 1 since everybody's reaction about it was great, but nah. (Also since the drama is short, around 10 eps only).

Kudos to the man acting as twins, he was too annoying to be honest that I want to punch the screen every time I see his character. The perv one too but the twins were more annoying.

Siwan's GF looked like Ryujin lol.

My reaction watching this was saying ""boring, boring, boring"" over and over. The only time I was hyped was the ending. Extracurricular was better.

I saw a lot of people mention the book the metamorphosis , and I think those theories are great , but I haven't seen anyone mention ""hell is other people"" which is another title for the , it's a saying from jean Paul Sartre from an existentialist play called Huis Clos, or No Exit . . In the play, three people are trapped in Hell — which is a single room — and ultimately while confessing their sins to one another, end up falling into a bizarre love triangle.

"" Hell is other people has always been misunderstood. It has been thought that what I meant by that was that our relations with other people are always poisoned, that they are invariably hellish relations. But what I really mean is something totally different. I mean that if relations with someone else are twisted, vitiated, then that other person can only be hell. Why? Because … when we think about ourselves, when we try to know ourselves … we use the knowledge of us which other people already have. We judge ourselves with the means other people have and have given us for judging ourselves. ""


The hell here would be the studio , as he is trapped in there he starts to go crazy and by ""confessing their sin"" we can maybe think it's about how the dentist forces him to bring out the ""psychopathic"" nature in him and his killing urge .
""We judge ourselves with the means other people have and have given us for judging ourselves."" The people around him make him think he's overreacting and imagining things , that the people there are okay and he's just paranoid , so we literally see him become more and more paranoid during each episode , as he starts to believe what other people (especially his girlfriend) are telling him . We can also interpret that , since the dentist keeps telling the protagonist he's just like him , that's why he starts to believe that . His coworker says he only pretends to be a nice person on the outside , so Jong Woo acts as according to those prejudices , smashes his keyboard and beats him up sending hum to the hospital. If we take the metamorphosis in question , as the protagonist begins his transformation and becomes a bug , he completely forgets what he used to be like and starts to become what the people around him think he is , paranoid , crazy , rude , a murderer .
This is just my theory based on what I heard about these books , I'm going to try reading Sartre and Kafka and completing the webtoon and see if I can correct it or come up with something more .

This drama is really amazing , I watched it in one day . The actors did a really great job , especially Lee-Dong Wook , it's not easy for an actor with an already established image as a sweet and nice character to break form that and play a completely different role as a psychopathic killer , but he managed to do that and played out his character really well . This is my first time watching Im Shi Wan and he did great as Jong Woo .

If I have any complaints about this drama , it would be that the last episode is a bit rushed , but that's the case for many dramas so I'm not going to hold it against it , overall this was a thrilling and exciting watch , definitely worth a rewatch someday .

A friend of mine loved this drama so I decided to give it a go. I had tried watching it once before, but had a hard time getting past the first episode. Since I've had more time recently, I pushed myself through it.

I have to admit that the acting is fantastic. As I was watching, I kept wanting to scream at the screen telling Jong Woo to get out of that literal hell hole. Everyone really did such a wonderful job playing characters that I hope are nothing like their real life personas ;)

However, I felt like ten episodes of this was too much and would have been done better as maybe a slightly longer film. Halfway, I was ready to call it quits again because it was not only a bit repetitive but also, such a drama is rather psychologically and emotionally taxing as well. I wonder if this would have been a drama that would have been better watching week after week rather than binging over the course of a few days.

I rated the rewatch value low since these dramas are hard for me to watch again, especially already knowing what happens. I'd say it's probably not a drama for everyone, but if the theme is up your alley, then it'd likely be a good one to check out.

If this were the only drama available to watch in the whole wide world, I still wouldn't watch it
I made an account just to say how garbage this show is and I have no idea what other reviewers have in their brains, I read them and decided to watch this but it was painful to do so, I felt I had someone over my shoulder pointing a gun at my head to watch it. It's hard to watch especially with those stupid twins, I should've stopped watching it after 2 episodes but decided to carry on with hope of it being a good series. The only hope it gave me was to become a police officer because that female cop is completely useless. The only thing that has going for it is probably the intro music and thats it, felt like a cheap low budget adaptation to what seemed to be a great webtoon as heard from my Korean peers, and even they told me everyone else thought the drama was a complete letdown, so if you're a 14 year old kid with no sense of good cinema go ahead and watch it lol totally not recommending this to anyone. waste of time and can't believe I spent 10 hours on it.

This drama will remain one of my favorites. If you're unsure whether to start watching it or not, just give the first episode a try. It has tension building from the beginning, and from then on each episode is amazingly creepy and suspenseful.

What truly amazed me was the camera work. I don't who takes credit for that, but it was brilliantly done. I don't think I've ever seen a drama with such elaborate shots and transitions. It really added to the story and it was done in a really unique way. It was just so good.
Aside from that, it has to be the first time where I don't have any flaw to point out. There are some things that do need clarification from the writer/director, but even these felt intentional. There's a phone charger coming into play for a bit of the story, and this scene is open to interpretation, but I don't think they would have integrated it to the story if it didn't have purpose. Whether it be to add to the atmosphere, or simply to show a character forcing an encounter, I'm dying to know what the meaning behind this scene is.
The ending was also incredibly chilling. One of the major advantages of the show was the completely unpredictable future of any given character. That to me was amazing, and the ending really fit the story.

The Actors :
- This was my first time encountering Im Shi Wan, who plays the lead character. He was really impressive in his role, it really made me feel like the plot wasn't just a story. Like we were witnessing someone else's daily life. It really was amazing to watch him as the main character. You could sense the character's unease turning to pure fear, and the 9th episode will forever remain one of the most intense episode I've seen in my life.
I can't elaborate without giving away some spoilers, so I'll leave it at that, but he really made quite an impression in this drama.
- Lee Dong Wook was made for this role. I had seen him in Blade Man before this, and consciously avoided anything he was in after that. But to me this role attested his talent as an actor. It says a lot, because this has to be a really hard character to play. The chilling sensation you have when he appears on screen, this was a complete surprise to me. I feel like the drama wouldn't be the same without him playing Moon Jo.
Every actor aside from them was remarkable, and I had the pleasant surprise to see the girl from DAY6's music videos cast in this drama. It was nice to see more of her.

The story also had perfect OST to complement it, the songs really fit the drama, and were also amazing on their own. (Yes I am biased, The Rose are fantastic what can I say)

That said, if you have trouble watching bloody / gory scenes, this drama probably isn't the best thing for you. I advise you to skip a few scenes if you're determined to watch it.

One of the best Korean thriller/psychological dramas
SFH was a drama I stumbled upon without any intention, and I'm glad I did because I was really satisfied with it. I'm going to make this a really short review, in simple terms: WATCH IT!

It has you hooked from the beginning and keeps you on edge every second, not only with the OST but also the way the drama has been filmed and executed. The psychological aspect is amazing, and the way this element progressively builds up through only a matter of 10 episodes - is commendable. You think you've finally grasped the main plot, or what's going to happen next but you're plastered with something completely different, leaving you second-guessing your thoughts and whatever you've grasped so far.

I mean, another bonus is Lee Dong Wook and how FINE he looks, but don't let that distract you from the fact that he's a part-time dentist who also has a passion for killing and cannibalism. (Siri, play 'Criminal' by Britney Spears <3)

""Humans are the most fearful creatures.""
This drama clearly has no strong plot. But, with only ten episodes, each spanning the length of an hour, it did not pull any punches.
Disturbing and dark, it begins with Jong Woo moving into a dingey apartment with the least rent out of all that he had seen. With a hopeless job and seemingly disconnected friends, he is thrust directly into the company of the many strange men in his neighbouring rooms. Yet, he has no way out. No one listens to his words or has time for him.

The drama brilliantly portrayed the sweet country boy Jong Woo's many incidents that ultimately lead him spiralling into a state of mental distress so much that we at one point are unable to watch it out of sheer stress. Im Shi Wan was excellent in his role and he conveyed the intense expressions and Jong Woo's state of mind with so much reality.

Help comes in the form of a charismatic dentist, Mung Joo, with whom he shares his similar love for crime fiction. But, wh he originally thought to be the most normal out of everyone, becomes his biggest nightmare. I saw Lee Dong Wook in Goblin, but it is this drama that truly showed his talent. The very mad gleam in his eyes, the flicker of compassion (only for Jong Woo, by the way) and his own strange perceival of nature and human mind was almost paradoxical. It was weird that Jong Woo and more chemistry with him than his own girlfriend Ji Eun, who was saddled with work load and never really semed to have her 'country boy' image of his removed from her mind.
People keep pushing their frustrations out on everyone , and Jong Woo, a good guy, realizes that he was being pushed around and maybe it was time to snap back.

The turn of events, the gory scenes and most importantly, the sheer incompetence of the police was mind numbing. There was a moment I assumed that one of the policemen/detective was working in favor of Eden studio.
*Mild spoiler*: this would also make the ending more possible.
I was suprised that I liked it so much. Every single supporting character delivered their roles well. All in all, this is definitely a highly thrilling, re-watch worthy drama, especially for starters of this genre.

maybe not to everyone's ""taste""
This drama started quite interesting and I admit I was hooked and the end was well done and surprising at end and I also liked the manga drawings over characaters at the end but for me finally it crossed the line from scary with flaky characaters to just sick〜 I do not really like these stories with psychopaths and seral killing [ it is scary how people like them so much it must be some primitive instinct buried deep in us all] so I take off 1 point perhaps unfairly considering how good it was as a drama〜but 十人十色 depends on your” taste” as you will see when you watchwww

Unique.
As Jong-Woo facing mental issues, the ending doesn't surprise me. Isolation, bullying, alienation, step by step he went into a black hole with no way out.

No one in his environment was sane and they all one after each other put his head into the water and pushing him off his limits. The residents of the hostel but mostly Moon Jo help him to embrace the darkness that it kept increase in him.

That rage he wanted to discharge, the power to do what he always wanted. In the head of Jong-Woo that's completely normal, he just reproduced what he constantly saw and always endured from others. ""Others are hell, imma be worst then hell then.

The realisation was wonderful, the writers have done a great job in their search and to bring awareness to mental health. It felt pretty realistic.

The acting needed to be excellent so that the viewers would take the show seriously and being immersed into the darkness at the same time as Jong-Woo. Both I'm Shi Wan and Lee Dong Wook pull off a wonderful act, it was magistral. LDW was the perfect protagonist, he should take more often that kind of role.

Some people, blame the ML ending pitifully way but I have one question: Would you’ve done better? In these circumstances, how can you be sure to end up better than him?

TRY YOUR BEST TO SLOWLY WITHDRAW FROM THE DARKEST IMPULSES OF YOUR HEART
I think if I were to touch upon every single thing that I loved about Strangers from Hell, I would be writing a novel instead of a review. I've actually seen this drama twice now because I started to re-watch it the day after I finished it. Actions sometimes speak louder than words, so let that sink in as I try to best express the amount of love I have for this show while also keeping it as brief and coherent as I can possibly can.

For me, watching Strangers from Hell was the equivalent of picking away at a scab you might have on your knee or elbow. It is immensely satisfying to peel back the layers of skin, no matter how gross or painful it might be. Except, in this case, the scab was the human psyche, and there was no hesitation whatsoever when it came to ripping apart these layers. This show was dark. It was gory. It was terrifying, and it left an ache in my bones and a hollow feeling in my chest after I finished the very last episode. There were moments when the show seemed to be hinting at going into a certain direction, and I would often think to myself, 'This show is already dark enough, there's no way they're actually going to do that,' AND THEN THEY DID, so I would have to let out an audible gasp for how daring the showrunners were. I think for the last five or six episodes, I watched them with my hand cupped over my mouth while also keeping the lights on because of how scared I was while watching.

I think one of the things that really worked well in Strangers from Hell and that helped to make it so enjoyable were the two main leads, Yoon Jongwoo and Seo Moonjo, played by Im Siwan and Lee Dongwook respectively. The acting was spectacular; I don't think anyone else could have played these roles. Jongwoo was especially interesting to me in the sense that he was somewhat relatable. Not relatable in the sense that I'm slowly going crazy (hopefully), but relatable in the sense that adulthood is difficult, people are difficult, and work is difficult. I'd also like to point out that I am currently living in a university residential hall with a communal bathroom - on the third floor, no less! - and I wasn't even assigned a roommate for this semester so it can get quite lonely at times in my room. I think this greatly affected my own opinion when watching Strangers in Hell and why and I was able to relate to Jongwoo.

Also, the amount of gas-lighting that was present in the show was insane. Not only did we get to see it with Jongwoo and the residents of Eden, but we also get to see it with Jongwoo and his awful co-workers, Jongwoo and his girlfriend, his girlfriend and her own terrible co-workers, as well as with the female police officer, Seo Junghwa, as she dealt with the detectives. I think this show did a really great job representing what gas-lighting is and how that can affect the mental state of a person, as well as stressing the fact that it can come in many different forms. This was most evident in the character of Jongwoo. I've seen some people complain about how this could have been a movie because of the slow-pacing, but I believe that it was the pacing of the show that truly allows the audience to see the changes that Jongwoo was going through, and I don't think a movie would be enough time to explore and justify Jongwoo's actions. Personally, I did not find the pacing slow at all and I found every scene, from dialogue to action sequences, to be thrilling.

Then there is Seo Moonjo, the sexy dentist of my dreams. He was wonderfully creepy and strange; I couldn't help but be drawn to him. I would physically get chills all over my arms whenever he smiled. His relationship with Jongwoo was so interesting to watch unfold. I could probably write a whole essay on that aspect alone but I will resist. Just know that this character was extremely well-written and that he drove me crazy in the best way possible. The supporting cast, too, was amazing. The actors must have put in a lot of work in order to prepare themselves to play these characters, the absolute darkest representation of human nature.

Another thing I really liked was the music. It was so haunting and eerie. It really helped to establish the creepy atmosphere of the show.

The camera work here was also really interesting to me, It was kind of shaky at times, though that didn't really bother me. Sometimes there would be shots that I think were meant to give you the impression that what you were looking at was the point of view of someone physically watching the scenes that were unfolding on the screen while also remaining hidden, kind of like a stalker. That was a really nice touch that helped to keep me on the edge of my seat.

And oh my gosh, the ending? What was that? I don't know, but I loved every single second of it. I think it really helped drive in the point of how Jongwoo is essentially an unreliable narrator, and it's up to the viewer to decide how much they want to trust his side of the story. It's definitely an ending that keeps you thinking about it for days on end, and I found it even more satisfying during my second watch.

Overall, if you enjoy watching shows that are psychological and horrific in nature, then I would recommend Strangers from Hell with all of my heart. The grip this show still has over me even after I've finished is still holding strong, so I have a feeling that this story will stick with me for a very, very long time.

Def not for the weak hearted
so i kinda needed smth intense and from the look of this drama i know that u could tell it is indeed intense.. it also is not for the weak hearted. I am used to watching horror and extreme shows but after finishing up this one nicely i feel like i need a drink to be able to get all what happened through my head.

what got to me is that the ML (ofc not our handsome villain) is indeed a very normal person at the start of the drama and i was doubting if Evil will win in this one as im used to angsty esp in this kind of dramas but Alas was i surprised by how STRONG the Evil side was and how it ended up winning.

Another thing i want to add is that this drama is somehow wholesome as it talks abt different subjects: Animal abuse, Mental illness, Sexual offence, etc. and then there's cannibalism like whew i was super shocked and disturbed at how not only did they consume but only gave out to others.. u know without getting into details......

Def not for rewatch to me but it was one heck of a ride and im proud of myself i finished it!

The first K-Drama that I watched
Absolutely gripping. I watched this is about a day, that's how hooked I was. The story was fascinating from start to finish. Thw premise itself is worthwhile - someone who moves next to potential serial killers but has no choice to stay due to financial problems. Strangers from Hell goes deeper and further with its story however, exploring PTSD, bullying in the Army, estrangement from family,etc.

The characters are all well developed and highly memorable. The ""Family"" all are creepy and scary in their own ways. The wide eyed young police officer was the source of innocence and she playes to role perfectly. Im Shi Wan was outstanding as our lead. Able to capture the nuance of what was being presented perfectly. On tbe surface he's fine but there is clearly something deeper that's not right. And well,we dont have to even talk about Lee Dong Wook who steals the show with his impeccable protrayal of the evil dentist.

Just an excellent series.

Amazing! The entire cast was just amazing. The actor who plays Yoon Jong Woo should receive an Emmy Award. His metamorphosis was so real. I later realized that I had seen him as the main role in Incomplete Life which was also amazing. This guy has real acting chomps on him. I look forward to seeing his future works.

Also, the guy from Goblin played his psychopathic character really well!! I didn't see his usual ""handsome"" guy character in his other shows. He was truly terrifying. The actor definitely proved his range in performance. He broke out of his ""handsome"" guy role and now I will definitely think of him as an Actor instead of ""just the guy from Goblin."" Know what I mean?

10, 1-hr episodes was perfect for this drama. There weren't any fillers. I had to take this show relatively slow because the torture is pretty gruesome.

OCN truly does make cinematographic art pieces. This is the network for serious and compelling dramas.

The ending is definitely not ambiguous, by the way.

It's a lot darker when you feel inside the misery.

It the entire series, all we hear and see was Jong Woo's point of view. We weren't able to know what the weird ones really think or feel. And it'll remain a mystery.

The introduction was not really intriguing to me. I thought it's just the characters, Eden Studio residents, are creepy while Jong Woo was an innocent person who'll make those people pay from whatever they'll commit or blah whatever. It's only I wasn't that fond first. But it gets more interesting even the direction of the storyline wasn't what I expected but awed me eventually.

Overall feeling was creepy, thrilling, and mysterious especially the ending with no explanation. As I said, we don't know any backgrounds and the real reason of the residents. It's practically a cliffhanger for me aside I want more.

Disappointed
I had enough expectation in this series. In many of the sites where I have read reviews and opinions about it, they consider it practically a masterpiece, or at least a very good series. The synopsis also caught my attention and because it was short (10 episodes of 1 hour) I decided not only to give it a chance but to watch it with all my family.

The first episode promised a lot but then the second episode gets a little boring (one scene in particular) and some episodes that follow are good and others not that much.

I consider that the idea is good but it is not well consolidated, I feel that it lacked strength. There are some antagonistic characters that are endearing but because there is not such a solid plot, they are not well used. There are also other characters that are left over and that do not contribute to the development or conclusion of the plot.

--------------Spoiler:
The perfomance of the dentist did not seem entirely convincing to me. I think the actor did not do a good job; he looks a little over-reacted.

The young police did nothing in the entire series. She spent all the episodes investigating but practically discovered nothing. In the end they kidnap her and she can't solve anything either.

I did not like the end: I think the transformation of the protagonist happens very quickly, practically from one episode to another. That is, if he is uncomfortable with everything and has an aggressive personality, but that is from the beginning; I do not see a slow transition of his personality that justifies the end (a slow transition where even he does not perceive what is happening to him), because if he was uncomfortable he could have left or looked for another solution. I feel like he goes crazy almost suddenly.

I would have liked another justification for what was happening because at one point I thought it was something paranormal since the dentist follows all of them almost at the same time anywhere and also he worked. I do not understand how he combined to follow so many people, work and kill at the same time.

I believed that the dentist was a character in the novel he was writing and at the same time an alternate personality of his, one he used to unleash his aggressiveness.

this could’ve been better but i still liked it
first of all, i love how creepy, intense and dark this drama is! i liked what the story is about cause its kinda new to me idk i’ve never imagine myself living with people like that so its kinda interesting. but i wish there would be more of the stories behind every character or in this case, the strangers, cause like all i know is that those strangers are crazy people and thats all. i think it’d be more fun and thrilling to know their stories too. also, there were some scenes that i find unnecessary too and some were left unanswered, so sometimes the story got a little slow for me. but i still was very curious though where it was going and how it was gonna end. lastly, the casts did an amazing job!!
overall, for me, it was thrilling but a bit slow.

So this drama has:
The most overreacting stereotypical boring psychopath. The other characters acting is alright, but they tried too hard to make this guy edgy.
Bad communication, ridiculous investigation, dumb decisions, cliches...
Unlikeable characters all around
Very annoying twin brothers
Worst girlfriend material
Very predictable ""plot twist""
Everything is predictable from a mile away

And of course in the end our crime writer guy who got so brainfucked by the events of this show be writing ""die"" endlessly over and over again. Totally buying that of course.....

Introvert
Are you a socially awkward potato? Do you hate having neighbors? WELL HAVE I GOT A SHOW FOR YOU!
Lee Dong Wook is my bae and seeing him as a psychopath somehow makes him sexier so naturally, I dove straight in headfirst with this one lol
Most horror/suspense series make you hate being alone but Strangers From Hell will make you wish you were alone and definitely make you hate the thought of neighbors. It's gonna be second nature to shout ""OMG you're gonna die!"" or ""Turn Around!"" from the comfort of your bed or couch while all the madness unfolds beautifully in a sea of screams, maniacal laughter and blood. Cause this series delivered it all!
It'll send you through a infinite loop of ""Wait, was that even real?"" and have you begging for a S2 (which I would be happy with, but it ended well enough to not be a cliffhanger).
Enjoy...

okay, I'm still recovering from the drama. I only have one question. why has this drama not got the attention it deserved? I could not find one flaw with this drama. I'm not exaggerating when I say this drama is a masterpiece.

Story: I could write pages just praising every line and every word of this drama. It unravels in an almost graceful way, revelation after revelation leaving me breathless. I couldn't stop watching but was too afraid to go to the next episode. There were scenes that gave me literal goosebumps. I had to pause at some scenes to just take in what was happening. I loved the pacing of the story, how each episode just gave us the right amount of fear and curiosity. I could slowly feel myself being sucked into the madness and it made me question myself. I didn't know who or what I was rooting for in the end. The subtle contrasts that I only noticed after rewatching it were really genius. I learnt a lot from the drama.

Acting: I couldn't ask for more from the cast. Everyone gave stellar performances. I can only imagine how hard it must have been for the cast to portray such complex characters but they truly did justice to it. their acting has left a lasting impression on me. one I will not forget for a long time. I have to especially appreciate Lee Dong Wook and Im Siwan. I could see the despair, madness and fear in Jung woo's eye. Moon Jo was like a super hot psycho that I wanted to hate but I mean how can I? just look at him, even his creepy smile made my heart skip a beat. I was scared and in love at the same time. Not to mention the chemistry between them which was like feeling the aftershocks of an explosion. I would love to see them act together in future projects. Everyone did outstandingly.

Music: the few osts that were there were really good however there were not many windows for it in the drama itself so I understand how they might not get the exposure it deserved but god damn was the background music creepy. it was not overdone. just the right amount of creepy music made the scenes thousand times more terrifying.

Overall: 100% recommend (unless you are easily triggered) I mean it is a psycho-thriller. The adrenaline rush I got from watching it is not something I will soon forget.
kudos to the cast and staff of the drama for this rollercoaster of a drama.

This Kdrama Shows Why Ghost Stories are lot less Terrifying!!
First of all I want to say that I thought this would be a Ghost Story and I had no idea what the synopsis is or what the manhwa is about and was so dang surprised that the situation the MC is in much much worse than I pictured.
This is a Kdrama which makes really feel creeped out and disgusted with the atmosphere itself. I literally had goosebumps and felt something was wrong so many times in the beginning itself. Though the violence in this is not hidden in any way we know exactly what is happening yet not shown too much. Even then I skipped through most of it.

The Acting is PHENOMENAL! Honestly every single person are so so perfect! Hat's off!!! Truly!!
We continuously root for the MC to survive and hope he doesn't get too affected by the people around him and the situation he is trapped in and helplessly watch as each episode becomes more and more twisted.
I must say one of the best Survival Horror stories I ever saw and just in 10 Eps of 1 Hr each! The pacing is well done, the editing, the Eden Studio itself, the atmosphere and just everything.

A Must Watch! Though this Kdrama may not be everyone's cup of tea.

Daebak!!!!
I was utterly surprised how good this movie turned out. I saw Lee Dong Wook was in it and thought why not. Man when I tell you he is the best villain I've seen in a long time. He was manipulative, conniving, endearing, likable, crazy, etc. I absolutely loved him. Si Won or whatever his name was absolutely adorable. He looked so innocent in the beginning and you could slowly see his mental decline as he fell into darkness. Ending was great, they didn't drag it out too long.

I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS.

To like or not to like..
I am torn if I like this series or I don’t.It’s creepy and intriguing at the same time.
During the first episodes I can’t wait to watch the next to find out if finally the male lead had escaped from the hell he’s been. But as the series progresses I find it hard to watch because it creeps me and I’m starting to pity the ML.
Trying to survive on his own amidst his social status, but it seemed that Lady Luck was not on his side. Finding it hard to fit in the society were everyone was different probably took a toll on him and it made him disoriented from reality.
Life in itself is difficult and we need a good support system such our family and friends we can trust and those who believe in us to keep us sane and to survive.

Watched it with my sister and it was one of the best Psychological Thrillers I have seen, in fact maybe the best. It was another piece of evidence of what a versatile actor Lee Dong-Wook is, having seen his performance in many other dramas. Im Si-Wan's performance was top of the line, although this was the first drama of his that I have watched. I do plan to find more of his dramas soon. Of course, kudos to the amazing acting of the rest of the cast. I can definitely watch this many times and not get bored.

We watched the episodes with so much dedication. However, I must admit that I am disappointed with the ending (not going to say what it was). I expected a totally different outcome.

incredible
Though I was a bit skeptical about watching this drama as I am really not the biggest fan of Horror, this drama is definitely one of the best shows I have ever watched. It's dark, very dark, and it definitely kept me on my toes the entire time as I wasn't really sure what to do. The plot was incredible with a very very very smart plot twist which had me shocked and in utter disbelief. The acting was brilliant and all actors suited their roles very well. I loved the music and most importantly, the camera work. Very good action scenes as well, it was impossible for me to take my eyes off the screen. If you are looking for a creepy drama with a lot of suspense, this is for you. Even when the plot isn't very ""busy"" you are always alert, waiting to see what happens next. I definitely wasn't disappointed and I can easily recommend it. Definitely worth watching.

Key performances by the main three actors, combined with the great production team of sound and editing makes 'Strangers from Hell' an instant masterpiece for any horror and psychological television fans alike. Plot was so diverse and had layers of thickness to it that I've never seen such a show so well thought out before.
The pacing is also brilliant in each episode - it never drags, and has the right amount of violence scenes and more 'casual' scenes. This show is the first to give me proper goose bumps in a very long time, and some scenes made me so enticed that I truly believed I was in the show at some points!
Horror fans will love this show, also give it a try if you're into thrillers and basic crime dramas! This show is definitely not getting enough attention from what it deserves, watch this now!!

Something like this actually existing?
The story is great and I enjoyed the flow of the story; but the ending and the plot twist???? (watch the story first so you would know XD). For me this is the one of the best kdrama that I watched. Starting from story, to ost(s), and to acting everything is masterpiece. The actor who acted as a twin from room 307 did a great portraying his role actually everyone of them did a great job! can't wait for the directors cut version.

Story: I don't know why Moon-Jo calling Jong-u babe and he said he was special to him? but I think that was cute hahaha I don't know why but the story is not intented to turn out like that. If they could just listen to Jong-u he will not turn like that :'( (I won't spoil it so you better watch it) and the end it was really confusing but if you're going to scan every details I think you will know it?. but I rate this (8/10)

Acting: They give justice to their role especially The actor who portrayed the twins!!! (10/10)

Music: good (10/10)

Rewatch: definitely I'm going to rewatch it sometimes so (8/10)

I recommend this to those people who love exploring some drama genre hahaha although yes as you can see it's kinda disturbing to watch it.

Disturbingly good
This is one of the most beautifully written series I've ever seen. It does start out a little slow but once the story gets going, it's impossible to stop watching. While watching this show I felt like my emotions were heightened, that's how good of a job they did with the setting and also the acting. I also enjoyed the unpredictability and how it went far beyond my expectations.

The psychological aspect is especially well done, I like how we got an insight into how the character was processing everything. Also shows how your environment can severely affect your mental state. Overall, I enjoyed this very much, though I understand it wouldn't be for everyone, however, if you love psychological shows with creepy undertones, I highly suggest it.

This is thrilling
I have to agree the plot is not that varied. The scene did revolved around office, apartment and certain other places.
Acting wise, Im si wan is really awesome. He managed to pull the character really really well. Her girlfriend also did good.
BUT, i think lee dong wook could do a slightly better job when maintaining his facial expression and voice when speaking. Ngl but sometimes he looks sly carrying that psychopath character hahaha. Overall terrific show.

fckin incredible drama, but should have been a full 16 episode!
my goodness. what a journey. truly incredible, more so because of the leads acting especially Im Shi Wan and Lee Dong Wook, bravo...!!!

despite so, this being an OCN dramatic cinema style drama, i have to judge it precisely based on that. i definitely think there are multiple plot holes in the drama that could have been resolved if the number of episodes were increased to at least 12, or better if it was a full 16 episode kdrama. they could have tied up the loose ends a lot better if this was written like Memorist (2020) where they introduce the villains/culprits one by one, and try to foreshadow and confuse us about the real one. that i believe would have made the quality and thrill of each episodes much more consistent because some of the episodes in the middle seem to have been filled with filler scenes that do not contribute much to the tension or the story.

some plot holes that i could think of:

1. the first guy who was introduced as Seo Moon Jo's ""chagiya"" (honey), he was killed too fast literally in ep. 2. and it was also the same episode that they revealed to us the true identity of Seo Moon Jo (the dentist). would have been nice if he had a bigger role and more screen time since he had the look and physicality of someone creepy/dangerous as well, rather than just a lackey of the dentist like the others.

2. Yoon Joong Wo's PTSD at the military service was quite unclear to me. we get throwbacks that he had huge anger management issues but i feel it would have been better if he had some sociopathic tendencies like the male lead's character in Flower of Evil (2020) instead of PTSD. i don't think people with PTSD are the ones to actively hurt others, but in the flashbacks, we saw that he was the one who joined brutally in the beating of his fellow soldier.

3. the manipulation of Seo Moon Jo into Yeon Joon Wo's brain that the latter is as capable of murdering people just like him, i think was not fleshed out enough. again, a problem of the lack of a number of episodes. in the rather limited screentime that Seo Moon Jo had in the drama, he was more of a 'psychotic sweet-talker' guy to Joon Wo rather than someone who truly comes across as a highly manipulative narcissist who's also physically intimidating/terrifying. Moon Jo for the most parts before his self-revelations, comes across as more shady than outwardly frightening. would have been nice if we get to see more of how Moon Jo directly tries to terrorize Joon Wo mentally and psychologically. also, Joon Wo's stay at the Eden Studio has not been that long at all and it did feel they made such a huge leap in the story just to portray him as someone who was suddenly going insane from all those crazies.

4. i also think the story could have been made more complex if there were stronger motives to the whole tenants and owner of Eden Studio conspiring in serial murder cases. the crime case mention in the final episode about a whole family who was brutally murdered in a vacation house was literally brushed over, and would have been so interesting if that plot was integrated more centrally to add mysterious/suspense elements to the story. also, Joon Wo and the new tenant Seok Yeon had speculation of sort that those tenants were involved in some kind of organ trafficking deals or something, but this potential plot point was never pursued, which would have added an interesting motive to the killings rather than just for the sake of creating 'dental arts/souvenirs'.

5. more importantly a full background story of how the long-term tenants of Eden Studio got entangled with one another through their upbringing in Spring Orphanage was never fully given to the audience. We also don't know very clearly what triggered Moon Jo's character to become a serial killer eventually at that point. He definitely should have had more screen time than what was given to him.

also, i found this very helpful comment on the last episode:

""Okay but... if Jongwoo really did kill those 3 (in a very messy matter), why is it that the detectives never found evidence that would point him as the killer? His fingerprints would've been on the wrench, knife, and the landlady's wrist. Plus, they knew that the vacations house killer was meticulous. Sure they got testimonies to cover him but isn't it also part of the investigation to look for concrete evidence?? Technically they only had Jongwoo's statement to tell them that Moon Jo was the murderer. The thug and Ji Eun's statements also proved that Moon Jo was the leader of the group but they had no idea who actually killed the 3 members. And during the Eun Jin's statement, she said that she heard the pervert getting killed by the landlady. If that's the case, she should've heard Jongwoo's voice instead of the landlady's. Lastly, forensics would've found evidence of Moon Jo's teeth collection, and detectives probably already knew that the vacation house victims and other victims of the Eden Studio had missing teeth. Why didn't they question Jongwoo's teeth bracelet??""

...which kinda points to how crime thriller dramas that focus on the complex psychology of human characters would always downplay the precision of forensic science. i get that they probably wouldn't have ended the drama any other way, but addressing this issue (or at least foreshadowing a lot more clearly that Moon Jo has now indeed has become a twisted psychopath with an unbroken thirst to kill other people who knew he had to somewhat clear his traces from the murder scenes) would have made the ending scene more neat and crisp.

overall, i must comment about the finale episode, which was utterly remarkable! the fighting scene between Joon Wo and Moon Jo was very deliberate and so well done, and it was quite a shock for me to see how they went all out with the killing rampage in that final episode, almost the same feeling as when i watched Parasite LOL. that's literally the scene where we could see Moon Jo using his towering height and strength over Joon Wo who's much smaller than him. just based on their fighting scene alone, i was able to imagine that their roles could also have been played by Park Hae Jin (Moon Jo) and Lee Joon (Joon Wo) respectively based on their body size differences. the casting really worked extremely well in this drama and the actors who played them also did such a marvelous job!

all in all, this is not exactly a drama anyone would want to rewatch, but someone who became a fan of Im Shi Wan and Lee Dong Wook through this drama might wanna rewatch it to relish/remind themselves of the phenomenal actors they both really are.

Good Enough
Korean Drama ""Strangers From Hell"" is a dark story that builds up to the great final twist in the end. The only thing that was missing was a bit of a more craziness of the main villain. All the others were mad enough to be triggering the insanity of the main character.

The latter was the star of the drama and the sole focus of it, as his downfall was well-orchestrated, even though there were evidence from the start that something was off that he himself was trying to suppress.

The performances, finally, were all great from everyone in the cast and the atmosphere pretty dark and suspenseful.

So, overall, 7 out of 10.

Masterpiece
I don't have a lot to write about for this review, but I want to praise the cast's(both main and supporting roles) fastastic acting, I love how the twins were portrayed by one person perfectly, how the pervert was well acted out, of course, the enthusiatic and creepy landlord should not be forgotten too! Im Siwan and Lee Dongwook also portrayed their victim and villain roles really well, I can literally sense Jung U's fear and distrust, as well as getting goosebumps from Moonjo's psychotic smile and his crimes. The show had really dark vibes and some scenes are too disturbing to be watched while eating HAHA, nonetheless the cinematography of the show was pretty well done and Eden Goshiwon is really the last place on earth I want to visit if it exists lol. I agree with other comments about the loopholes existing in the shows, and one thing I wish to see is the characters' backstorys. Like what caused the twins to behave like this? How did the pervert join their killing plans, did he not get weirded out at first or is he naturally psychopathic? I'm very curious about how did Moonjo turn out to be a serial killer as well, also during the shower scenes in the earlier episodes, scars can be seen on Moonjo's back. Did he have a traumatic past that caused his personality to be like this? I want a season two featuring their past!! TT

Heavy psychologically, creepy and dark.
There is something uneasy that makes me put this note. I really liked the psychological approach to the drama. I personally understood what was happening with the character on the second part (episode 7 or 8 approximately) but ANYWAY. The environment, the settings, the music are the perfect combination that makes you feel bad. Add to that the play of all the actors and it works ! I wouldn't put a 10 because I think it's a series that needs to be seen in a good frame of mind. I'm not a sensitive person, but I released it ten minutes ago and I feel like I need to see something less dark, with butterflies and flowers ^^. despite everything its a must-watch (at least once !)

Bloody but brilliant
Bloody, dark and very grose but really well written and executed psycolagickal drama.

The editing between bloody murder and takboki are beautifully done. As I'm more in to the story then the blood I had to forward the bloodsplatter.

The caracters are really well written, you will probably end upp hating everyone around him (with a few exceptions), and feel the erge to protect the protagonist from all the people around him or want to see them strangeld.

The psychological stuff kept me guessing and I foundmy self efforletlessly trying to make sence of what was going on thruout the series. The casting and acting where spot on. Lee Dong Wook is the ultimate psykopath, Siwan is soo sweet that you just want to hug him and the side caracters each have their role and do it well. ""I only killed one cat"".

I'm still not shure what actually happened, so I may have to digest this a bit longer. Yes this is completely insane so get ready for a ride.

I watched the first episode and then proceeded to watch something else, it was boring, but. BUT. Give it a chance. Once you get to about half way through episode 2 or even episode 3, you will be hooked. It's a bit slow to begin with, but totally worth it.

I was in the mood to watch something with psychopaths and murderers, this DID NOT disappoint. Half the time, I could not tell if it was reality or Jong-Woo's secret fantasies. I so badly wanted him to break free and become a true psycho.

Lastly, let me just say, I have never really thought that Lee Dong-Wook was my type, BUT I ain't never seen any other a man look so sexy while murdering people. *chefs kiss*

Mind blowing !!
Really well made dark series. Though the plot is simple, the dark nature of humans is portrayed well.
Strengths: Acting, Plot, Editing, screenplay, character development.

There are not many negative aspects, just lapses at few places like.
*Just that they could have given more clarity on the doctors goal.
*Ending is open to interpretation, instead the writer could have chosen a unambiguous ending.
*Slightly slow paced

If someone likes drama, thriller, crime, psychological just go for it. Don’t hold back at all.

Scary but brilliant
This movie is one of those movie that can make you squeamish and helpless, especially since the background felt as if it was a living character, as if you are watching while expecting an impending horrible car crash about to happen.

The ambience and the music is absolutely wonderful, and the cinematography is brilliant. ""Eden Studio"", the place where the main character lived in, is a horrible place and the series did a great job in showing it. It emphasizes the feelings of the main character towards a place, including its dingy walls and dirty background, as well as the offensive and the mentally unsound inhabitants. In a sense, Eden studio is like one character encapsulating the helplessness of the main character's flight.

Throughout the series, I sometimes find it hard to watch because I felt really bad for the main character. He is someone who has a lot of pride, and struggles to make his bread due to his literary career and would feel relatable to everyone starting out in life. We can see how he is a flawed character with a lot of anger and suppressed feeling as he grew increasingly isolated in the place he lived in, with his girlfriend treating him coldly and his coworkers bullying and humiliating him. Moreover, his only place of solace, Eden studio further exacerbates this condition by being so claustrophobic and morally unsafe.

The way the movie is set is like a horror movie, with a lot of suspense as you await the main character's unraveling sanity and the evil that exist in the studio.

Lee Dong Wook's acting is superb, it is amazing how he is able to be so creepy while still being so charismatic and handsome. I especially like the interactions between him and the main character and how he is trying to mold the main character into him. However, the situation the main character is put in is similar to how a toxic relationship works- he is isolated and was gaslighted several times (by the inhabitants and his own girlfriend), and was made to question whether he is overthinking and overly sensitive, and each of his step is controlled (as he had no financial independence).

It is a very good psychological drama in all aspects, and bordering that of a horror movie.

I really wasn't expecting it to end so good.

This is basically another memorable Dong Wook role, seriously, those last two episodes the way he was acting, was just incredible!

Si Wan too was just so good in the last two eps and they were brilliant, no doubt.

This drama is on par with Save Me as far as I'm concerned because the role played by Lee Jung Eun of the eccentric building owner Eom Bok Soon was just a beautiful performance like the cult leader preacher from Save Me. Honestly, it will give you chills and creep you out but the actor she played it so naturally. We all know an ahjumma like that right, nosey, and no respect for privacy and always making you uncomfortable and making you feel bad for something completely rational, basically the ultimate gaslighter.

But okay, I already said this before, it's not perfect and in the middle it sort of lost its place, for about two episodes but I don't need perfection.

I'm glad that they took a risk making something that would make some people uncomfortable because it's not a chaebol romance or comedy action procedural, they made something serious. That alone is commendable. But then they chose the right cast and except for the lull in the middle everything else was done well.

The plot twists were clever and unique. The dialog was brilliant! ! The camera work was ART and it's all so realistic the ambiance becomes a part of the storytelling. So, yes. I'm really happy with the way it ended.

I watched this while the drama aired, then watched it 6 more times. First of all, I have to praise the acting, each person did their job with a clean 10. The storytelling is incredibly good, but confusing for some people, to understand the drama people need to think about (I have no intention of valuing but anyone who says drama is bad because you are not ready to understand the action) ... The music is perfect. from OST to sound effects, every moment kept me on the brink of uncertainty. If you are a smart person, who likes psycho drama and a person who loves the open ending, you MUST watch this!

Okay. First #Bloodtriggerwarning. This series contains blood, violence & gore. Not into this kind of stuff? Then probably look away. But if you are, then this is the right drama for you. Can not deny but at first it’s a tough pill to swallow because it involves the introduction to the world & characters. Once it hits the high road this is when it gets rather interesting & tense. The more we go through the story, the more chilling details will be revealed.

This drama shows the ugly side of humans, to be exact, not understanding what a man is truly going through. (Judging a book by its covers) so it shows the consequences of it.

Give it a try! It’s awesome!

Horror that gets under your skin...
STRANGERS FROM HELL (Hell is Other People/ Tainuen Jiokida) based on a webtoon by the same name, was an excellent psychological horror drama, full of dark, gritty weirdness. It many ways it takes you down the rabbit hole, so to speak, delving into dark topics on the basis of human nature. Are we good? Are we evil? Perhaps there's only a fine line in between. Strangers from Hell showcases all that darkness of human nature and exhibits the increasingly troubled mind of our struggling young protagonist as he deals with other people, and their various forms of evil and darknesses.

Everything escalates from there. And what we get is such a masterpiece, though one that might be difficult to stomach, as its themes get increasingly darker and darker. Suffice it to say there are many references of murder, torture, cannibalism, and other forms of cruelty that can make most of us a bit squeamish. The slow build up, jarred with occasional but shocking scenes of violence or the macabre, makes the whole experience rather tense.

As a whole, the show completed what it set out to do. Give us viewers a dismal and disturbing glimpse into human nature, as through a mirror darkly. It does so brilliantly. Combine the excellent cast and acting, great original soundtrack, with great story buildup, and elements that mix the mystery, crime, suspense, and horror genres, you get an utterly twisted journey such as this series. It definitely might not be for everyone, especially for the faint of heart. It gets under your skin.

Truly from HELL!
This k-drama drama has been the shortest I have watched with only 10 episodes. However, it PACKS what longer dramas do not have in 16!

It is truly a master piece of horror, very DARK and twisted until the very end: Hollywood would only dream to create such an intricate story that will make you look the other way at times!

The acting is SUPERB, the location creepy as it should be, and the plot masterfully written.

I had never watched a dark k-drama but I am glad I did because it really adds flavor and variety to family dramas and others that are on a more positive note.

I would love to watch another one like this one in the future but it is not something you want to watch every week.

In just a few hours I did finished the whole drama and It was worth.

I have seen all the hype and famous this drama was and today I did give a chance and watched.

And was like... WHAT????? It's so good. (Sometimes I did root for the villain, sorry)

All the cast did a amazing job, even me while watching did a get a little bit scared ☠☠☠

I love they way they did put the OST, in the right moments. Like, when did have  a ""moment"" and they did put the classical music. I loved.

Lee Dong Wook, he acting surprised me so much in a very good way. Never seen him in this type of role and I want to see more.

Jong Woo, I'm a little confused about what did happen in the final in your head my bud, but I starting to get the hole thing.

It's surprising, intriguing and GOOD. Very good. Truly recommend!

hell really is other people
I finished this show 2+weeks ago and i'm still thinking about it and lowkey considering rewatching it. It hit all the notes and even though I know a season two wouldn't make sense, I want more!

This was my first foray into Korean thrillers/horrors and boy did I ever pick a doozy. I have had this show on my watchlist on netflix since early 2020, but never took the plunge to watch it and now I am regretting that. It is SO GOOD. Like....really good. I didn't know what to expect going into the show, but it was so so much better than I ever thought it would be.

I could go on and on about the story, the music, and most importantly THE ACTING. The entire cast was so creepy and enthralling. Lee Dongwook and Im Siwan had some crazy chemistry and their scenes were always just on another level of creepy and intrigue.

All in all, I would recommend this to anyone who likes things that are a little messed up and crazy, but with a kickass soundtrack and a very talented group of actors. I will be rewatching this in the near future and losing my mind at it's brilliance, again.

Eerily Entertaining
This is not for the faint hearted and those who have a weak stomach for gore. I found myself dieting for some reason while watching thru the 10 episodes. I can't seem to swallow food thinking about the carmine scenes you'd always see on most episodes. The insanity and how each actor meticulously portray their characters are superb, you'll hate and get scared of them to the core. I love the soundtrack, it gets stuck in your head making you consciously become aware about possible scary things around you, just like what any successful horror flick does to you when it's really a hit.

probably my favorite show i have watched.
me, personally, i love this show so much. i saw it on netflix when i starting using my friends and i immediately got interested. my favorite character is mun-jo of course because he is played by the beautiful and amazing lee dong wook. i was watching the first or second episode of this show and i got my mom into it so i couldn't watch it without her. we both loved the show. it took me a little longer than expected to watch this 10 episode show of an hour each because i had to watch it with my mom, but we still loved it.
the acting was magnificent. the facial expressions, actions, everything was amazingly done. i have the OST playlist saved on my spotify, i listen to it all the time. the actor of the twin(s) did very well. the character was pulled off so nice by the actor. im glad that they took his role in the show. im siwan, my dude, you did a m a z i n g in this. lee hyun-wook also acted very well in this. im not going to list off everyone's name but long story short, i DEEPLY recommend this. of course if you are sensitive to violence, insanity, language, blood, etc, i would not recommend. even though it is a good show, it can be triggering to some people. over all else, i loved it and will most defiantly be watching again.

Creepy and intense
Strangers from hell started as a basic suspense story in the first 2 episodes, however things started taking a different turn when Lee Don Wook was introduced.

Charming dentist and the strangers with their murderous intent in a residence, teams up to form a bunch of psychopath who kills for fun. The climax was a bit of twister, although it was a little predictable.

Nevertheless, Strangers from hell was an intensely suspense thriller, with lots of violence and craziness that sometimes maybe a bit difficult to consume.

My Rating : 8/10

Whenever you watch a thriller or horror drama, you always wonder why don't people leave the place immediately if they feel something is wrong, but this drama shows how one's surrounding life and people keep them grounded, even if it is hell itself. The main hero gets so many chances to Escape, but the people surrounding his life and poverty makes him stay. This drama is so unique and so thrilling, I loved it, it makes you stay seated on your edge.

It makes you connected with the characters, and the ending was so twisted and Im shi wan acting was superb as always.

Ok, this show was... really really good?! Not as predictable as I thought
I went into this show with zero expectations, bracing myself for lots of screaming and cheesy VFX to compensate for a very predictable, trope-filled storyline. However, by the end I was so immersed and impressed by how well-crafted it was, and how much it disturbed and rattled me.

First, the story: psychologically twisted while still being realistic. The premise is a bit far-fetched, but still feels real because at its core it is grounded in the reality of human behavior. It conveys how deeply one can be manipulated by their surroundings, and how people, strangers, can harbor darkness and evil in its various forms - envy, narcissism, gluttony, lust - and infect you with it so that it latches onto your weakness and traumas, ultimately transforming you into a different, unrecognizable person. These are very scary, mysterious things that happen in real life, in every community -- low-income, wealthy, uneducated, professional. This show did a great job of portraying what happens when these situations collide and circumstances spiral out of control.

The characters are all unique, and the acting was stellar. Jung Woo was great and while his overall arc and character development was interesting, it felt a bit rushed towards the end. His acting was also on point 95% of the time other than when he tried too hard. All the apartment dwellers were weird and unsettling, but I was most impressed by Moon Jo, played by Lee Dong Wook. His acting was masterful and chilling, and the role suited him so perfectly. I had only seen LDW in Goblin before this, which I found quite forgettable. But he REALLY shines in this role and gave me serious creeps. Now I understand his appeal – not because he's a creepy psychopath lol, but because this role showed his immense versatility as an actor.

The atmosphere they crafted was very creepy and well done. The cinematography was very creative without being excessively stylized and over-the-top. It successfully conveyed the torment of living in such a horrible, disgusting cramped space with crazy people.

Some criticisms, I do wish the show included more background info on the dynamics of the apartment dwellers, maybe through some flashbacks that show us how they met and wound up living there. The show was also riddled with a lot of pretty dumb character choices, a few predictable twists, but none to really put me off completely. The end also felt a little bit rushed and sloppy. Brief allusions to The Metamorphosis by Kafka were brilliant -- altho I wish they explored this more.

Overall, very disturbing but highly recommended if you can stomach it! It's one of those shows that stuck with me for days after finishing it and gave me a lot to think and lose sleep over.

Get Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer
This was quite a gem in psychological thrillers. An aspiring novelist moves to Seoul to begin his writing career but can't afford rent, so he winds up in a run down hostel where most of the residents are especially weird. This sets the stage for the ensuing creepiness that occurs and we slowly see the mind of our ML unravel as he fails to grasp the gruesome happenings around him.

What I loved most about this show is the fine performances by the ensemble cast, especially Lee Dong Wook. He has appeared in many dramas I have watched over the years, but this one best showcases his talent. He was so creepy in an understated way. He made your skin crawl with his wide tooth grins. Kudos to the young man who plays the unfortunate novelist. His metamorphosis from starry-eyed youth to unstable and angry is the most fascinating journey to watch. Also, it was totally unpredictable. Everyone had their roles down pat. The only person I didn't much care for was the girlfriend. She was too dumb and wrapped up in herself to notice what her boyfriend was going through.

There were some plot holes that left me questioning some parts of the story but, for the most part, the writing was virtually air tight. The length was perfect at 10, one hour episodes. You can binge watch it in one day. Loved the soundtrack and will add it to my Spotify. Great choice for those in the mood for gritty.

The most unsettling drama i've ever watched
Wow. I just finished this drama and needed a few minutes to process everything. I actually dropped this drama for months when I was at the 4th episode cause I felt like things were too slow for me. I picked it up today and decided to binge the rest of the episodes cause I had nothing better to do. I believe it was starting to really pick itself towards the end of the drama and by the 8-10 episode I was completely absorbed into this. This was one of the most unsettling dramas I've ever seen. The acting was phenomenal and the eery atmosphere of this drama had made me sit at the edge of my seat. This drama really did get better the more you watch it. The only reason I gave it an 8.5 was the fact it was a bit too slow for me, in the beginning, I was struggling to get through the episode and I was growing impatient waiting for it to pick up. BUT IT DID PICK ITSELF UP.

If you're questioning whether you want to give this drama a chance or not. I would just advise you to be mindful, this show is heavy in gore and can be a lot to watch, please make sure to be aware of the warnings before proceeding. To those who find this drama slow or boring at the start, I assure you this drama does indeed pick itself up and get so much better. If you ever get uncomfortable or feel like a scene is too much, stop the drama, The scenes are unsettling and heavy to watch and they don't get better or less grotesque, BUT STILL to those who LOVE psychological thriller and horror, I RECOMMEND THIS DRAMA. It is BRILLIANT.

Predictable but still thrilling twist
This drama had a twist that I was kind of expecting, but overall I had mixed emotions about it. It started out okay; a little creepy but kind of slow and disjointed, and there were characters I cared about and some I didn't. I definitely got a little frustrated, and there's this feeling of impending doom.

There's a twist towards the end which I kind of saw coming, but it was one that I had wanted to see so even though it was predictable, it raised my rating of this drama by quite a lot.

There are some very subtle moral questions that I liked too, and some of my questions are left unanswered but that's okay! Great October watch, finished just in time for Halloween.

Beautifully put together.
It took me a bit longer to finish watching this because this drama is so intense.

This was a beautifully shot psychological thriller. I have to mention that I love the soundtrack too. I truly feel the frustration while watching this drama, which brings out that helpless feeling from under pressure from society to meet certain expectations, and also from abuse of senior power, while feeling lonely, fighting the battle alone against the world. The series has done a superb job at bringing out that cramped and gritty feel and depressing mood of the main character, Jong-woo's living condition, as well as portraying his deteriorating mental condition and sanity as the drama progressed.

If you like psychological thriller, definitely give this a watch.

Rewatch value - I almost never rewatch anything, same goes with this one.

I finished this drama two days ago and I'm still thinking about it.

Everything from the sound design to the acting conveys a truly fascinating story that tells what the human mind is capable of when there is the perfect storm of environment, life situations, and the question of what makes a person human.

I'm someone who really values excellent story telling and execution as well as acting ability, and this drama has fulfilled both wonderfully.

The plot was exactly what you would expect in any Psychological Thriller. The building tension, the unexpected twists, and relationships that are more than what they seem. It was very carefully crafted and laid out, and the pacing was perfect amount of rising action and falling action. Besides these things, I always find it fascinating when shows explore the depths of human's sanity and what that means when we let the darkness win (or what happens when we fight it). This show, in particular, had a special way of making it feel like a thriller but also a commentary on what extent our minds try to cope with our environments.

It felt like everything in this drama was intentional and genuine, and added more layers to this very rich story. Starting with quick cuts of our main character trying to find the perfect housing, we see his growing desperation until he lands at the Eden residence where he is quickly greeted by a smiling building owner who is quick to provide a quick drink and cheap rent. From there we have longer shots where the camera pans over the structure of this building and the audience gets a clearer view of what exactly our main character will truly be living in. This attention to detail in camera work extends to its sound design utilizing clear monotone sounds to convey the weight of a single moment, the background noise that clutters the main characters' mind, and the use of well timed OST created an atmosphere that remained unmatched from most dramas I've watched.

An actor I have to highlight here is Lee Dong-wook. I have seen him previously in dramas like Goblin and Touch Your Heart and currently in Tale of the Nine-Tails. My view of him is the perfect male lead who has a heart of gold and a smile you could die for. His visuals are perfect for the classic, dreamy male lead in romantic comedy dramas. So seeing him in the role of the villain made me truly believe in his acting ability. Lee Dong-wook's acting style of conveying the most subtle emotions with his eyes truly shone in this drama as he played this mysterious, yet insidious character. One moment he seems like a polite neighbor who wants to make our protagonist feel at home, and in the switch of a moment there is a darkness lurking that can be barely restrained. The subtle choices with his facial expressions were key in different moments of this drama and he truly delivered. This enhanced performance further highlighted Yoon Jong-woo's equally brilliant portrayal of our main character. While the tension of this drama is centered on two of the leads, each side character of this drama is vitally important and the actors who played them knew that.

It can be easy, sometimes, to rely on actors to deliver the exact message you want to tell the audience, but with this drama it has an easy balance between directing, sound mixing, and excellent acting.

Always listen to your gut
This drama was amazing! I am not a fan of gore and bloody scenes, but I was hooked on this drama and I wanted to finish it. It was so worth it! The series takes us on Jung Woo's journey to insanity and teaches us that, well, hell is indeed in other people and even in ourselves.
To be honest, if Jong Woo decided to trust himself a little, he wouldn't have stayed at the studio and maybe he wouldn't have gone mad. Sadly, his friend and girlfriend didn't trust him either, so that made him feel even more lonely and had to deal with all of that himself. The only characters that were supportive of him were his mother and smol bean Seok-yoon. Maybe if he got there earlier, things would have been different.
I understood that his girlfriend had her own struggles, but she was quite frustrating. She never listened to him or thought he was overreacting.
Some scenes were questionable (I mean, the sudden addition of his old friend from the army, I liked him, but I don't know why he had to be present), but it was an amazing drama with beautiful acting and got me thinking a little. I would skip the bloody parts but I'd watch it again!

As expected from OCN, it is one of the best adaptation, from my opinion.

Let's start with the story. It is very disturbing, creepy and scary (at least for me because I'm not used to this kind of story even if I like thriller drama) which makes this drama particular. The ending is even more disturbing, I felt very uncomfortable watching it but it is worth it. I mean, it is part of the story, and makes sense. I felt so sad for the main character and also for others but I do not want to spoil it so I will not give every details. The twist at the end was a very disturbing twist yet it was a good one. I also like the fact it portrays the loopholes of the system : the social loopholes which do not facilitates things for the poor class and shows the vicious circle that happens in general, the loopholes of the law enforcement; etc. One of the best point is that there was romance but there was no cringy/embarassing romance which I truly appreciate !

For the cast, I am so impressed about their profesionnalism and their quality. To be clear, each one of them did a perfect job, even the police woman, all of the residents of the appartment, and of the course the main actors. All of them did a great job, the roles were really not easy to do, but they did so well. Of course, Lee dong woo and Him Si wan were just so good, it is impossible to complain.

The osts were just so good, like, really. There again, it is impossible to complain about the osts.

I truly recommend this drama as it is a very good adaptation of the webtoon of the same name ! You just got to be prepared of the creepy side of the drama lol

This is what finally made me get the appeal of Lee Dong Wook and I don't know what that says about me as a person. Either way, he made this drama for me. So, I am one of the people who think this drama went a little too slow with the narrative in the beginning. Sometimes, it felt like it was just walking circles while I wished to see more of the main character's interactions with Dong Wook's character.
I feel like this drama could have gone for *more*. Not on gore or violence, but they could have had even more fun with the concept (which is already very fun).
The acting was overall great from everyone, the production design was also very well done.
One thing I couldn't get behind was the main character's girlfriend, but those may have been cultural differences from my part. I just don't understand how any loving person would let their partner live in a place like that lol.
The drama was fun, especially by the end. In a perfect world it would have been as overtly homoerotic as Hannibal, but we can't have it all.

From the end of the first episode—HELL, from the beginning I was already intrigued by what was going to happen. I wanted answers and I don’t regret sticking to it since it was a really good show. From the story to the characters and how it was executed I really enjoyed it. All the actors were really good in this one. Not surprised.

If you’re fan of crime, mystery, psychological type shows then definitely you’d find this interesting. There’s a nice twist waiting for you!

Worth the shot! DO IT!

Definitely Horrifying!
The ending had me puzzled, so much so that I had to search it up. Although I'm happy the story followed with a consistent storyline with every episode slowly building up to the end. But one of the characters, Kang Seok Yoon I didn't really see what happened to him so I'd say it wasn't perfectly wrapped up but it's okay because once you watch you'll probably assume what happened to him. I like it but it actually was quite disturbing and I can't say much about rewatch value because I haven't actually rewatched a drama. Moral of the story, don't bottle up your anger and be careful who you trust.

MASTERPIECE!?!?
OMFG...Let me say this. I haven´ t watched that good series in a long time!
Maybe im weird and i propably need a help but the series isn´t that traumatic as a lot people say it is BUT that doesn´t change the fact that the series is perfect.
The story is pretty good and interesting, especially at the end my small brain couldn ´t understand a thing lmao. I was so confused ( and i mean it in a good way ), that i had to read some explanations.
THE ACTING? SO AMAZING! It felt so real but if i´m being honest I wasn ´t that scared or anything, maybe because i know that it´s just series and they are just an actors ( but the one pervert with gllasses was really disgusting i must say ) .But on the other side I had to watch some behind the scenes to confirm the fact that they are all ""just"" an actors and not real psychopats lol
Music could be ""scarier"" but I didn ´t pay much attention to it ( as always )
I will definitelly rewatch it someday in the future. There is so many things i know i didn´t notice at first that i simply have to rewatch it :D

Overall MASTERPIECE
As I said before, it wasn´t that thrilling or traumatic as maybe for other people but that´s not problem of the series. It´s just the fact that propably nothing in this world can somehow surprise me anymore...but the atmosphere was really great so if you are not fu*ked up like me, you will propably NOT feel safe or/and comfortable while watching this series lol

Firstly, I am so guilty for delaying this gem even after liking the cast, director and everything.
This drama is one of the best I've ever watched. From acting to direction, everything is just brilliant. I know many have watched this drama for Lee Dong Wook and I am no exception(come on, he is so handsome!!!) but kuddos to the supporting cast for making it even more worth watching.
I was actually surprised with Im Siwan. He has improved a lot compared to his previous works. I hope he continues with this and achieves big.
The only thing that irritated me was Min Ji Eun(Jong Woo's girlfriend). She never really tried to understand Jong Woo. Was always busy with her life and never cared for her bf. Even went against him and thought of him as a crackhead. She was hands down the most annoying character for me(No offense to the actress though, she did a fantastic job).
Music was just amazing. Background scores were used perfectly with every situation.
Lastly i would like to say, if anyone is delaying this like I did due to some reasons, please just go and watch it. It's really worth the hype and you wont regret it.

Wow
What mastermind cooked this up??
Wow. What can I say other than wow?
Such an amazing drama...it keeps you enticed and practically begging for more. It's weird but goddamn is it my kind of weird.
Honestly, it's probably one of the best dramas I've ever seen. It's so different and crazy and just incredibly outlandish.
You have no idea what's around that corner, you have no idea what's in that fridge, you have no idea what the next sentence- the next movement will bring.
Absolutely and undeniably certifiably insanely good. Watch this drama and revel in the absolute pure madness and ""what the hell is going on here"" moments.
Wow. Just wow.
If there was another season...sign me the hell up.

Portrays insanity perfectly
I legit have no words. This show is a game changer. Personally I didn't find it that scary but the ending, when the officer realised Jong-O killed everyone.. I had chills! You need to watch this! The acting is so spot on its like watching a documentary. The quotes in this film are so deep too! Like when Moonjo saw Jong-O go insane and said ""You are the best piece of art I've ever created."" BRO. Its kind of sad too because Jong-O was normal and happy at the start. The residence destroyed an innocent man, and the innocent man destroyed the residence. Highly highly recommend"

It takes a watch
This one is a bit of a slow burn. The action drags along and then hits you full force. Character building of all main characters is key treating the watcher much like the police officer in finding the clues. The watcher can as well place themselves in the role of the main character able to sympathize with his situation in living in terrible circumstances as well as having other aspects of one's life worse for wear. Watching the main character's mental state deteriorate is both interesting and saddening given all he's endured and the ending was one I was not seeing. In terms of viewpoint from the antagonist, the camera work does well in occasionally showing his viewpoint and having the audience act as the stalker which is interesting. Not a drama that has a happy ending per se, more like bittersweet and one that gets you thinking over it for days.

THANK YOU 'THE ROSE'
I descover this masterpiece from my boys 'The Rose' (kpop band ) who sung the ost for this series and i can say THANK YOU !!!
◇I loved the plot, its has so many overturns, i didn't expected to take this way, it was a very good surprise for me, particularly the ending
◇The acting was superior, the way they played their roles was impressive
◇The ost was amazing
◇The only thing that i can count as disadvantage is about the scenes (l will try to explain it as good as it gets ): the way of transfer from one scene to other was not smooth.
Anyway, i really recommend to everyone who want to see a masterpiece psychological thiller!

This is such a good show!
This is my first time writing a review on a drama so please bear with me.

Story: 10/10
Okay, I absolutely loved the story for this drama. There was never a moment when it got so slow to the point where it became boring to watch and every scene felt like it was important and contributed to the story nicely and made it feel like it was going somewhere instead of being in one place like how some dramas do.

Characters: 10/10
I liked all the characters in this show. They all had their separate ways and personality which put the story together and made the show more enjoyable to watch. The only character's personality I wish we saw more of was Yoo Ki Hyuk but that's about all.

Acting/Casting: 10/10
All the actors were great and they did a fantastic job. The acting really carried the story perfectly.

Rewatch Value: 10/10
I could rewatch this again, it's just a really easy watch which is something you don't find often when watching some dramas.

Overall: 9.5/10
I really enjoyed this show and you haven't seen it then I recommend you watch it because you're missing out.

Thank you for reading my review. :3

Awareness
This show is not your typical kdrama, the story is dark that it surprises you in every episode! I feel uneasy every episode that is why my Rewatch value is low. The OST really fits the scenes, every time the OST plays it gives you chills because it’s really good and Lee dong wook I must say, he’s really good. We got to see his other side as well since we always only see his romantic acting side. This drama also has a good message to always check upon your friends as some might be struggling quietly 👍🏻 And to always ask for help when needed.

Completely Mind Blowing!
**I watched and finished this back in 2019 and this review was taken from my blog, which has better formatting and images that go with the review. Please check it out: http://fearstreetzombiereviews.blogspot.com/2020/04/review.html **

I'm coming out the gate here with a big 'ol: ""HOLY SHIT!!!"" If that offends you... I don't know what to tell you because this is a whole damn mood with this show! I wish I was kidding. Okay not really because this how was totally amazing and badass! Y'all, I have no idea how this show has been labeled as a flop! Whoever said that about this show is completely INSANE! There are only 10 episodes of this show and let me tell you, there wasn't a second of this show I was bored with. There wasn't a moment of ""Oh I really need to go do this-this-or-this"". Actually it was more of ""If one more person interrupts me while I watch this, I might actually flip my lid."" Pretty sure I looked like this by the ends of it all: O_O

Let's hope that's not what I really looked like though.. but let's face it, it probably was, because... what is sleep? Hahah And if you know me at all, you know this is the show I have been wanting to watch for MONTHS but could never get my hands on it, but I finally did and I DEVOURED it!! (Or did it devour me? ......?) And those that know me, know I hate mysteries/thrillers... of any kind. So for me to ̶l̶i̶k̶e̶LOVE something mystery/thriller, you know it HAS to be amazing, because I'm a purely horror kinda girl

Okay, back to the show, the acting was off the chart amazing. Y'all know me, there is always at least one person I tend to pick apart saying ""Eh the acting could be better"". That can't be said for this show! They ALL acted so well that I was constantly second guessing myself if I knew what the hell was going on or not. Even the most annoying character didn't get on my nerve as much as I thought he would because he was such a important character.
ougharwilughrwiuhgr UGHHH there is seriously so much I want to say but can't and that drives me nuts!!! hahah Because it was so freaking awesome!! I just want to go on and on about it. I mean EVEN THE SOUNDTRACK IS AMAZING!!! Please please if you get a chance, check out the soundtrack: H͇E͇R͇E͇. You won't regret it. The music fit the show so amazing. I admit there are a lot of movies and shows I have watched there i just roll my eyes and either say either some don't fit the show/movie, or I get mad because they add like 20 songs to the soundtrack that weren't even in the movie.
Every song here was in the show (least to my memory they were) and they all fit.
Everything about this show was such a freaking masterpiece that I'm like... WHY ISN'T THIS EVERYWHERE BY NOW?!!?! WHY IS THIS NOT TALKED ABOUT?!?!
The hype on this show is so low, it makes me want to cry.

This show is literally the KING of this genre! Fight meeeee if you think different! Lol Between the amazing actors and the setting, everything was complex and one of a kind yet... different. I'm not going to lie, shows and movies tend to have tons of ""settings/locations/backgrounds"" right? Kinda just... calls for it I guess? This show didn't have many setting locations, you can count them on your hands - Which brings me to this point, whoever set this up is a king. Because to be limited with places, they still knocked it out of the park while keeping ̶p̶e̶o̶p̶l̶e̶Me mind blown. I see these things. I can't help but notice and roll my eyes if someone constantly reuses a same setting through 60% of a show. Everything that usually makes me roll my eyes or kinda annoys me, didn't when it came to this show. Which is crazy to me. Sorry, I just can't hype this enough.

DUDE!!! The ending. Oh my gah the ending had me totally mind-fucked. Because I knew without a doubt that I knew how it would end. Lets face it, whether it's a book or show, when you read or what enough, you tend to just know how it will end by the middle. rhgilrghirugie That ending left me questioning my sanity because I was like ""Oh! It's going to end hella different"" then I was like ""wait... maybe not"" then back and forth.... I got tired trying to guess. hahaha That ending left me so mind-blown that I just looked at the screen like O______O 15 minutes after it was over. It's been longer now and my brain is still like: ekfjbgveirybvieuabvileuarbveiuvbfduivhbfdubvfdhyvbeiulvuqeibv
and me even writing this, I'm having to just pick words out of all this scramble and HOPE it all makes sense. If you EVER have the chance to watch this, I am actually BEGGING you to watch this. You might think I'm kidding but I'm not. This show has currently taken over my life to the point I want to keep it on repeat for the next few weeks to months. Lol Don't judge me. I can't help that I love it this much.

Wow just WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
I already could tell that strangers from hell was going to be good from the first episode but having just finished it all I can say is wow South Korea really is the master of the psychological and horror genre that other series just cant seem to compete .
Lee Dong Wook did one of the best jobs ive seen thus far taking on a psycho role but hat truly impressed me was the rest of the cast having not seen any of their work it was such a shock to see how real it was.
In all honesty I hate the crime and thriller dramas that center around politics and police coruption and what not so I was more than please to see that this had nothing to do with this and jjust focuse on the psychologocal factor.
The whole series was a masterpiece from start to finish but the ending was just the cherry on top really one of the best.
I guarntee that you will never look at strangers the same again after this watch.

INSANITY AT PEAK!!
So, hey guys! I have finished watching this drama not too long ago, and Lee Dong Wook's voice is still ringing in my ears whenever I close my eyes... I swear, now hearing the word 'Chagiya~' is no longer heart fluttering for me. All I remember is his creepy smile when those words left his mouth..
After watching 'Goblin', I fell for Lee Dong Wook's cute role there. To be honest, I somewhat knew that he could pull out some dark roles, but his acting was beyond my expectations. The story is.. simply put.. WILD.

Yes!

I felt intense frustration at times.. This drama is very provoking, I must admit. The main lead's acting is just fantabulous! Wait... Fantabulous? Is that even a word? Don't know.. I lost one fourth of my sanity after watching that drama!
The way the gruesome scenes were acted out, with the creepy background music slowly paving it's way under my skin.. gosh!
I literally had to keep the curtains open most of the time so that I don't feel surrounded by darkness...

And the ending of the drama.. it will leave you to hang and die... why? Cause, you know very well that you won't be able to watch another drama like this. You know what I mean?

Story: VERY interesting. Definitely kept me invested to the last second. I usually have a problem with the ending but this one exceeded my expectations. Also, don't worry about it being short, you won't notice once you start.

Acting/Cast: I was on edge the whole time! This is the type of acting where you forget they are actors, you're just convinced they are the character.

Music: Only rated this as 8 because I was too absorbed in the show to notice.

Rewatch Value: Although I just finished, and have only watched once, I know this is very rewatchable.

Overall: After seeing this show, I want to go back and rate all the other shows I've seen as 0. Seriously. I say this as a very picky person, this show was ideal in every way. An absolute masterpiece. Watch it, even if you are doubting it.

I have stated this before and I am sying it again- I threw caution to the wind and watched this series asit was clearly not a genre that I watched. I basically only watched this due to the actor Lee Dong Wook as I watched two series with h and loved him dearly in them! This character is TOTALLY different from his other characters but he kept me enthralled with his acting!

Story-10/10
The storyline was excellent! It went in a direction that I never saw coming. I mean, I started this on 11th May and finished it on the 12th May. That's how entertaining it was.

Acting/Cast-10/10
All the actors were excellent in the characters that they played. It also showed me a different side of Lee Dong Wook that I didn't know he had. He is truly a superb actor and I need to see more series/ shows with him starring in it.

Music-8/10
The music was awesome and addictive.

Rewatch Valu-1/10
Stated it before. This is not a usual genre that I watched. I basically only watched it for Lee Dong Wook. There is no way whatsoever that I will watch it again.

Overall-8/10
The suggested overall is 7.5/10. However, this series was good, so I am going to give it an 8. I will recommend this series to people who actually like this genre or who wants to see Lee Dong Wook in another acting role that isn't Goblin or Tale of the Nine-Tailed.

Well, that was wild to say the least...
If I remember correctly, back when this first aired, I started watching this drama, but I didn't, or should I say couldn't get through even the first episode. I'm not sure if another drama interested me more, or if this creeped me out too much because I'm a scaredy cat. Well whatever it is, here I was watching it, now finally finished it because a lot of people in my twitter timeline kept talking about the drama (or should I say, the characters Seo Moonjo and Yoon Jongwoo in particular?) And me being me, even though I was a scaredy cat, I'm also pretty curious. A pretty bad combination of personalities.

And honestly, I don't think I have much to say about this. Not as in, this is boring, or this is bad. But as in, I just really don't know how or what to talk about this. I started off finding Jongwoo relatable. He seemed shy and timid. The way his surroundings stressed him out, from his creepy neighbors to his rude workmate. How his girlfriend and his senior treated him, alienated him, didn't bother listening him out. How his mind plays out what would have happened if he doesn't keep his cool and blew up all his feelings. You don't know how glad and happy I was when he had the new neighbor who got along with him, and his old friend from the military who listened to him and even went with him to help out (Though we all know how that ended...)

I finished it only a few minutes ago (or an hour?) as I'm writing this. And therefore, I'm still pretty much processing the ending. I didn't really know how to feel. I feel like I understand, but on the other hand, I feel like I don't understand it yet, as I don't know what to say about it. But.. I feel like if I had just continued watching this when it first aired, it would feel a lot more thrilling, a lot more stressful. I like marathoning series just fine, but watching series on going, as each episode airs every week, it always feels so much nicer, more thrilling, and probably would make me more interested, and more attached. So, that was probably the only little disappointing thing about this and it's not at all their fault that I watched this late. But at least I got to find out what this was about and that's enough.

Soo, finally I decided to write a little bit about this masterpiece.

First things first: The story
From the first few minutes I was got so captured and I couldn’t let go anymore. The characters were so well executed and the pacing of the story was just great. As a person who read the webtoon I was skeptical at first cuz the whole progress of our Jungwoo turning crazy would be so hard to express. But the producers didn’t disappoint at all. At first I thought they’d change the ending but when the plot twist came- holy moly, I liked the drama version even better. It was even more of a shock.
THE MESSAGE: it stands over everything, it’s such an important thing to point out these days, mental loneliness is so deadly. And how everyone can get their dark side turned upwards when they’re around the wrong people.

The acting: guys when I say, this is high class acting, I mean it that way. As I mentioned earlier I wasn’t sure at first if they’d be able to deliver the same emotions that I felt while reading the Webtoon, but my doubts got pretty fast thrown away and i was so hooked up onto the performances since first episode. Plus the way the actors fitted onto the characters from the book- amazing.

Now my favorite point: The MUSIC.
Holy god dayum, I immediately downloaded every song from this show! That never happened before, since I’m also a high critic of OST because I often feel like it’s out of place, doesn’t fit here and there or in horror movies I just want to turn of or skip this creepy passages because it makes me feel uncomfortable. But in this drama, when Jungwoo walked through the dark and oppressive corridors and you just expect a jump scare around the corner, it made me keep on watching it, through the music I got so caught up in this.

Rewatch value: what can I say, I already rewatched 3 times and I’m sure there’ll be some more.

OVER ALL: A great drama with great actors, the right amount of splatter and an amazing message on top. What do you want more?

This is the kind of drama that I love to watch. Im Siwan's acting was amazing and Lee Dongwook as a psychopath killer? That role surprisingly suits him well. I absolutely agreed with the Korean Hannibal-Will thing. The other casts did a wonderful job as well in bringing their characters to life. Especially Park Jong Hwan who played the twins.

I loved the way the tension was built. The directing and the editing made the whole mood amd atmosphere unsettling and creepy. I couldn't help but feel nervous whenever a character was in some kind of danger with one of the residents. And the way the story ended was just *chef's kiss* Ambiguous and left enough room for doubt. Also, the soundtracks were all such a bop.

This movie should’ve been called: how to make a serial killer
I’ve seen many comment talking about how they disliked this show because it was either too long, or too fast. I think everyone has a right to their own opinion, but I think this show was a perfect length. As I finished watching each episode, I felt sad as I realized I was one step closer to the end. Maybe that’s because I’m simply a lover of mystery, intrigue, horror or thrill, but I think this show was just a good show.

The plot:
I think a lot of people disliked how some characters weren’t expounded on enough, or some things just weren’t shown enough light on. I think this is silly, because the show really takes most things from Jong woo’s perspective. We are taken on a journey to see things from his point of view. We are put into his shoes, almost as if we are riding a roller coaster. I liked how there weren’t any “flashbacks” to the past to show a past memory. I like how there is still mystery and intrigue around some of the characters, as this gives the viewer the opportunity to really use their imagination. Some people enjoy concrete stories and facts, I like how some things were just left to the imagination.

Acting:
The acting on all parts was very good. I really liked Lee Dong Wook’s character in this, he had a really great chemistry with the main lead. The chemistry felt so believable, I wouldn’t have been surprised if the two characters had more than this love- hate relationship that was developed. I could really feel the frustration felt by Jong woo, as he fell more and more into an insane, psycho state of mind. It was really cool.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, I think people should really give this show a try. It may be one of those kinds of things that you either love, or hate. Whatever perspective you choose while watching this show, I hope it creates something more enjoyable for you to watch, and I hope you can appreciate it just about as much as I do.

This is very well written. Every time you think you have something figured out it throws you for a loop but not in a ""whhooooaah plot twist"" way but in a ""oh! I should have seen that coming because they hinted at it ealier! Thats so smart!"" kind of way. The characters are interesting and the actors do a great job, especially the main villain . This show really does the unreliable narrator trope justice by having you root for the maim lead all through it, only to leave you wondering if it is a good thing he survived at all.

Disturbing yet interesting
This is probably one of the best kdrama thriller I've watched. I won't gonna ask for more and there's no need for season 2 because the series was all enough. I can't call whether it is masterpiece or not but all I can say is, good is just an understatement because it surely one of the great kdramas I've watched. The casts were chosen perfectly and they are all suitable to their respective roles. Plus the sound effects and osts made it creepier, the location seems fine for its genre and this is highly recommended for everyone who loves dark series.

Few reasons to watch this series:

First, this is not a typical story about ghosts or supernaturals, it was about humans with their inhumane deeds. It simply tells us that our enemy is also the other people.

The casts potrayed their roles perfectly. I'm glad that all of them justified the characters from webtoon adaptation. I highly praised every casts there because they did a superb work! Im-Si Wan (Joong Woo) was really an effective protagonist, the way he speak and the way he express his anger captivates the viewers. Lee Dong Wook (Moon Jo) is such as versatile, I thought he only suit for romcoms but I was wrong. He proved that he can also portray being a serial killer, he used his charms to gaslights people. Lee Jung Eun (Bok Son) also did a great job! I really feel frighten whenever she tries to be generous then aftetwards there is some sort of change that you need to pay back. Park Jong Hwan (Deuk Jong) that crazy guy also one of my fave cast there and kudos for him doing such a double role. The way he laugh makes me laugh too. Lee Jong Ok (Nam Bok) that horny guy, I hated him throughout the series but I have to admit that his horrible personality actually added creeps.

It was confusing and leave you puzzled. I kept on binge watching it to the point that it took me just one and a half day just to finished it.

The plot twist wasn't that really good because it is predictable but still the story line is great.

There were some scenes where it shows lacking but still applause to OCN for producing such this wonderful series.

I considered writing this review as soon as I finished it, the last episode was quite the finale leaving me on an adrenaline high. However I stopped to continue one of my other dramas and when I came back to review this I no longer felt I'd give it as high a rating. I find this drama to be well worth the watch especially for the finale that required the build up it received, however thinking back the build up left a sour taste in my mouth. Although I'd gladly rewatch the final 3 episodes, the rest of it was only worth one watch.

The major issue wasn't in the story, but the characters. Everyone in JungWoo's daily life outside of the goshiwon was infuriatingly plain and served the single purpose to push our main character mentally. His girlfriend was incredibly discouraging and trusting of strangers more than JungWoo, his senior from college only hired him to make him his junior again, and his coworker said the rudest things about JungWoo and treated him like crap for absolutely no reason. None of these characters seemed to have agency of their own and could be summarized by their actions towards JungWoo. His life outside the goshiwon took up almost a third of the show.

Later in the series they introduced 2 new characters to be friends with JungWoo. The first moved in across the hall and immediately took to JungWoo like a younger sibling, the second knew him in the military and, although bewildered by what JungWoo told him about the studio, rushed to the aid of his friend.
one was an incredibly satisfying addition, the other left me feeling cheated and empty.

On the flip side they did a really good job of setting up each character at the Goshiwon, even the sane ones.

Amazing plot, great actors, awesome soundtracks and a rewatch value of 100%
So this is actually the first time i am writing a review but after watching this drama i just haad to write a review and praise this it. That being said, lets jump straight into the review. The plot of the drama was very well stocked, it started out pretty normally and slow so that you can get into the story step by step and then it adds to the intensity episode by episode. Every and i am saying every character was amazingly acted out by the wonderful actors/actresses and i want to praise one the most, which was the mentally disabled twins. That actor played his character so well i couldn't believe how he can keep up his role that well all the time. The scenery was greatly shot and i loved every moment of it. As soon as he entered the ""Eden"" Studio, that atmosphere of real creepiness instantly kicked in. The soundtracks backed up everything that was going on in the drama, they were just really filling that plot with creepiness. ONE THING and only this one thing that i missed in this drama was the background stories of every character living there, like i would have liked to know a bit more about them. I mean they tell how it got to that point and stuff but yeah more developed background stories would have been great. But maybe its more developed in the webtoon so yeah. All in all it's rewatchable and i will rewatch it for all the details i missed at the beginning of the drama when i didn't really know where it was going yet. So great work, hope to see more dramas like this!

Not that amazing.
I am torn, the story begins as the synopsis indicates and that a young man - Yoon Jong‑woo - will live in a residence where his neighbors are more than suspicious.

The problem is that there are only 10 episodes, and they could have made more use of them.
We practically have to wait for episode 3 to have a first interaction between our two protagonists, and it is neither memorable nor long. The build-up is slow, not much happens except the fact that we know from episode 1 what kind of people are his neighbors, it's a shame that it's not a surprise or a revelation for later, it would have been nice for the audience to wonder who is who.
So basically, until episode 7, the plot is slow - which is not a problem in other series - but here the interactions between our two characters are rare, there are no surprises and major revelations. Seems more like it's the build-up to why Yoon Jong‑woo freaks out and gets violent.
I agree with a review that says the show is all about insanity. The story isn't that amazing and it's really focused on our main protagonist going from normal young man to giving a free ride to his violence, the series has build-up only that.
I would have liked more, more between our characters who have a certain chemistry, that we understand more the motives of these characters since they are not mysterious.
All we have are two twins who giggle and are murderous, an equally murderous perv, the manager who seems just as crazy, and Seo Moon‑jo the creepy dentist. It feels more like these characters are here for the grand finale and when people will inevitably have to die.

I would say otherwise that the atmosphere and the tones of the series are well created, it's more or less scary, dark and horrifying. The overall production is good - but there are plot holes - and the actors, all without exception, fit into their roles perfectly, but none of the characters marked me personally.
Like I said already, the two protagonists interact very little, and suddenly Seo Moon‑jo decides that Yoon Jong‑woo is very special to him, without there being a tangible relationship between the two, except Seo Moon‑jo being creepy since the beginning and stalking Yoon Jong‑woo.
It's really the relationship that pops up, out of the blue, which is why I wish I had more episodes or else had them interact earlier so it doesn't seem so sudden.

The very end - the last ten minutes - is really the exciting part of the show, that ending is open ended, our character is inevitably changed, and there's a last minute twist, which leaves us with a possibility for a season 2 - even if I doubt it - and the return of a character.

But it's a nice crime series overall, it's not the scariest of the lot, nor the best scripted, but it's nice for those who like the genre, not a lot of mysteries though, it's more into the impact of scenes that are made to be scary and made us feel for Yoon Jong‑woo, but hey without suspense, it's hard to keep an interest.
The characters play their roles well even if I would have hoped for more, even coming from our two protagonists whose performance is good but nothing more.

Great premise but painfully ableist
I started watching the first episode and I was very happy with it. I loved the main character instantly and it had very good dry humor. As far as I understood the premise of the story was basic but that doesn't mean anything, I'm sure they made something great out of it.
What wasn't great was that carricature of a disabled person. I was in physical discomfort seeing the actor act like that. The character is a harmful stereotype of disabled people being stupid, strange and - what I found worst - dangerous. Of course disabled people can be bad people, but the drama implied he's bad because of his disability. It would have been very easy to come up with a different character, just saying.

Surprisingly hopeful and at times heartwarming tone for a show full of monsters and death.

The show is more action and characters/relationships driven compared to my initial assumption of it focusing on the story itself. The plot is quite simple: people turn into monsters, humanity has to survive, but in the midst of it, Sweet Home asks one important question ""What it means to be human?"" and explores it throughout all the episodes. It shows the best and the worst side of the humanity - the will to survive that can unite or turn people against each other; the will to be humane as a way of fighting against the circumstances, but also using the horrifying situation as an excuse to abandon of the empathy.

Despite the show claiming to be in line with thriller, horror and psychological genres, it falls closer to action as a leading one. The plot might seem simple, but it did amazing job connecting the dots slowly presented. Quite a few times in the 2nd half I recognized the continuation of the plots and hints dropped in the beginning episodes. While the main question might not be answered and the ending could seem disappointing and unsatisfying for some, I found it to be the best possible approach. Any other take would fall short and seemed forced. It definitely leaves a lot of room for possible season two, but lack of continuation of the story would not make me angry either.

We are introduced to an brilliant cast of characters, that all have different stories to tell, that will resonate with the audience. In a short period of 10 episodes, I've got to see well built character development not only for Cha Hyun Soo, but also for many side characters. While I strongly disagreed with many of the character's decisions and behaviors, at the same time I could understand their reasoning behind it. If I had to pick my favorite characters (beside the star of the show Hyun Soo) I would pick empathetic Yoon Ji Su, brave Jung Jae Heon, resourceful Han Du Sik and level-headed Lee Eun Hyuk. That said, the chemistry between the whole cast was out of this world and they played off of each other well.

The wise advice I could give to anyone before starting: don't expect dark psychological horror. Even tho the show explores quite a few psychological themes, as I mentioned before, it leans more towards action with addition to some dark humor, especially in the beginning episodes. That said, the thing it has to be applauded for: the stakes were real. You know the shows, where you feel close to nothing when characters are in danger coz you know they will survive anyway? Not here. Each problem presented to them, each encounter with monsters, each turn made me tense, scared but also excited for what's to come.

I'm not exactly one to pay attention to music in movie or shows, unless it truly catches my attention. Here, all the songs were extremely fitting and perfectly supported scenes they were played for.

If I had to complain about anything, I'd say I was not the biggest fan of the CGI monsters at first. Since I was expecting dark psychological horror like Strangers From Hell, the cartoon-ish like models with questionable motion put me off. The moment I accepted this is not what I sign up for and started to enjoy the action, I started to appreciate the design of the creatures. Some had comical features (we see an a*s once) but it balanced well the dreadful emotional moments happening among the characters.

What's more, in the beginning episode the plot was not presented in linear way, so it might be confusing. Later on the time jumps are barely happening and it's easier to follow the story.

In conclusion: I cried, a lot. I got attached to each and every character. I cared for what's going to happen to them. I was curious about their past stories and how they affect their current decisions and actions. The show simply made me engage in whatever was happening on the screen, to the point of me binge watching it for 10 hours and forgetting to eat.

Warning: there is a lot of blood, some gore, story about child abuse and one for severe bullying. It talks about suicide and self harm. These themes might be too much for some viewers, so feel warned before giving it a shot.

Sweet Home ended me
Sweet Home ending is insane. The special effects, plot, cast and production is well planned. The ending was way different from the webtoon and there is now more room for season 2. Every single monsters is so detailed and so insane. I loved how they didn't show many things which the webtoon had, now they show it in the season 2. Amazing acting from Song Kang, Lee Shi Young, Lee Do Hyun and everyone. Everything single scene was a slay. One of the best Korean drama of 2020. Must watch! They way I panicked in every episode is very scary.

As A Webtoon Reader
My review for the most part is going to be coming from someone who read the webtoon and LOVED it.

STORY: I know they finished this before the webtoon ended, I know they couldn't add everything because it would make the budget too high. That being said, some of the changes felt pointless. They missed the timing for some characters' deaths and then gave them pointless deaths that did not live up to their deaths in the webtoon. They added the female character and basically stripped Wook of everything that made him a good character. For Eun, they made her mean and it really ruined the sibling dynamic between her and Hyuk. For Hyuk, they rid of his ""funniness."" My main problem with the story is the damages they caused to the character's relationships with each other. Hyuk and Hyun's friendship was nonexistent, instead, Hyuk just used Hyun as a dog. Hyun and Jisu's relationship was switched out for Hyun and Eun. Eun and Wook did not have their friendship. Wook and Yuri's relationship was barely there. I am just disappointed with how they handled the webtoon relationships.
The monsters were watered down. In the webtoon, they were hard to kill are were always a threat. In the drama, they were easier to kill and kinda just disappeared in the last two episodes... I kinda wished the ""Do I Look Good?"" monster was here, they teased us with lines relating to him, but he never came :( The CGI was pretty good, the best has to be the ""I Can't See"" monster, he looked VERY real. Protein, the running monster, and the spider monster were goofy-looking sometimes XD
If I were to not have read the webtoon, it would not have been bad. BUT, I would have been confused on some parts because you need webtoon knowledge to understand somethings.

ACTING/CAST: they all did their parts perfectly. They all acted so well. Kudos to everyone because wow.

MUSIC: I am not gonna lie, some times the music just did not fit. I wish they would've had more intense songs instead of always using Imagine Dragon's ""Warriors.""

REWATCH VALUE: I could rewatch it, but I probably won't. I do not rewatch things often

OVERALL: As a webtoon reader, I am disappointed and would give it a 7.5/10. As a drama watcher, I am satisfied and would give it a 9/10. UPDATE: after rethinking it, I changed by overall to an 8/10

If it's not broken why change it?
Is my first time doing a review, also English is not my first language but i hope whoever reads it understand my points.

I think most people that read the webtoon would agree that while the casting and acting of all characters was close to perfection, but the changes done to the characters narrative were really bad, the comic was Hyun's fight between his inner demons and his love for his friends and the growth of all of them while being in the end of the world, while in this adaptation i didn't feel most of Hyun struggle nor his triumph against his own mind, his relationship with most characters felt like something was missing and the changes to some of the characters felt pointless, if you are gonna change them is to make them better, but aside of a couple characters, almost everyone changed for the worst.
If this was a completely original drama it would have been a lot more enjoyable, but being an adaptation it was impossible for me to not compare them both, it felt worse than the original story.
Don't get me wrong, i still enjoyed it and think it was a good drama so i still recommend people to watch it, but you should keep in mind that if you got the time maybe reading the original comic will give you a better product.

P.S: Also I'm really annoyed about the overuse of Warriors, who the hell thought it was a song appropriate for the scenes it played?, it ruined my immersion in key scenes.

From A Webtoon Reader’s Perspective
Please take note that I have read and I am a huge fan of the webtoon, but for the sake of your watching experience, I suggest you don’t compare this to the webtoon at all.

THE STORY: The director only took some elements of the story and plopped it into a whole different scenario. Right off the bat, you’ll see a bunch of difference and from episode 5 and up, there’s almost little to nothing that’s similar to the story. However, if you’ve read the webtoon this should not scare you away from watching. Just keep in mind that you should try your best not to think of the webtoon, because I did that and over time it just ate me up. The show in itself is not bad at all. It is a good drama, but I think it failed to adapt the webtoon successfully. The main issue that I had with the show is that they made the characters more “distant” to each other and none of them had the relationship like in the webtoon. The chemistry each character had is what made it so special, and the fact that they cut this element out is so disappointing. Eunhyuk and Hyunsu’s friendship was my favorite. Their interactions was one of the best parts of the story and I’m mad they took out Eunhyuk’s nerdy side. I also didn’t like how you couldn’t see the thought process whenever they transformed into monsters. By that, I mean Dusik and the husband. Seeing how Dusik wanted his legs just so he can see his wife and son made it so much more meaningful and made his death a lot more sadder. The same goes for the husband. He is self centered and that ate him up in the end, so even if he annoyed you, you still kind of sympathized with him in the end. Now, like I said you shouldn’t compare the show to much to the webtoon (like what I just did now) because there are so much more things I can point out about the show that the webtoon did better. But I don’t want to be unfair because the show is good. The story is a bit more on the action side and had some focus on the outside world instead of just the residents of Green Home. The ending is also open, so it gives room for a second season. In my opinion, the CGI isn’t bad as people make it out to be, and is actually a lot better than you’d see in most shows. I really loved how the Protein Monster looked like and I don’t think they butchered any designs of the monsters at all. Overall, the story itself is good and you shouldn’t shy away from this if you’ve read the webtoon.

ACTING: The entire cast did a phenomenal job with this. Song Kang never disappoints and I don’t think anybody could’ve pulled Hyunsu as well as he did. The rest of the cast also did amazing so I have no complaints on this end.

SOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack is a bit weird ??Every time they played Warriors by Imagine Dragons I would try to tune it out of my ears because it felt so out of place.

REWATCH VALUE: I’m not the type to rewatch types of shows like these, but it is pretty short and you could rewatch it again.

OVERALL: Compared to the webtoon, this show isn’t that much. But it is a good watch as it is pretty short and the story itself isn’t bad.

Sweet Home, Where The True Monsters Reside With Your Head...

In the gory dystopian Japanese classic Battle Royale (2000), the style of ‘ fighting until the last survivor’ has created a lasting legacy upon numerous western franchises ( consider movies like the Hunger Games and Saw) and video games as well, whilst series like the American graphic - novel based and Zombie show the Walking Dead (2010-) have established an interest in contemporary dystopian dramas and franchises. Yet, as dramas go, Sweet Home doesn’t entirely stand out at first amongst the multitude of ‘ race- for- survival’ - style movies and dramas out there.

Most webtoon readers will probably argue, however, that the one thing which the drama does do well in regards to divulging away from past dystopian tropes in a similar manner to the eponymous webtoon , is being able to maintain the archetype that the monsters aren’t created by some pandemic or freaky lab accident, but the human psyche’s repressed fears and desires. This is one of the main focuses of the show and one of the main obstacles for the main protagonist Hyun ( Song Kang) in order to confront ( both literally and metaphorically) his own demons over the course of the drama.

On the other hand, whilst it is important to respect both a webtoon and “ based-upon” drama as standalone productions in their own rights, it is undeniable with the great legacy of the original webtoon to notice where the drama fell short of expectations at times. ( With all due respect the drama did maintain some of the impactful themes of the original webtoon such as mental health, murder, smoking and violence).

The greatest of the show’s flaws came from character development and interaction throughout the series.

For those who don’t know, one of the critically-acclaimed features of the original webtoon ( sans the fighting scenes) was the ability to show how the numerous characters of the webtoon with different personalities, backgrounds and beliefs were able to develop bonds, alliances and friendships throughout the events of Sweet Home. That’s not to say that the drama didn’t achieve this at all. To some extent, we got to see this interaction en par with the webtoon through the first meeting of Hyun and Lee Eun Yoo ( Go Min- Si) in episode 1 and their interactions over the course of the drama, as well as the humanity of the most unlikely character, the gangster Pyeon Sang-wook ( Lee Jin Wook) through his heart-rendering backstory in later episodes. Apart from this, there seemed to be little dedication in scenes to actually focus upon other and more intimate character interactions.

Yet whilst the show arguably does not have the time to cram in 142 chapters of character interactions into 10 episodes alone, there were still endless opportunities to explore and humanise other important characters in the drama in order to make their backstories and their events such as Yoon Ji- Soo ( Park Kyu-Young) and Jung Jae Hyeon ( Kim Nah Hee) more impactful by allowing them to grown upon viewers.

This ironically moves us onto the second problem of the drama; the CGI effects of the monsters.

As it happens there was something more sinister in some regards to the effects of Hyun’s eyes turning demonically- black in scenes than the bloodshot appearance in the webtoon, and the nightmarish forms of the “ Half- Headed” and “ Protein” Monsters will certainly leave goosebumps for viewers afterwards. What is hard to understand, however, is how lazy the CGI could be at times within this show, with several scenes such as the “ Seoul Apocalypse” appearing more like a 2000s cheap horror movie than a drama released this year. It seemed only adding to this effect was the single shot style frame typically employed for romance dramas which felt oddly out of a place in a horror drama where inventive styles ( even slow-motion) or the feeling of distortion ( which have been employed to portray Hyun’s nightmares) would have been better suited for theme of Sweet Home.Additionally one of the biggest of the drama had to be the OST. Whilst hearing Imagine Dragon’s Warriors during a fight scene or the ironic energetic K-Hip Hop artist BeWhy did add a level of pacing to the ending, it soon became repetitive and lost impact to hear these songs again and again without a change of pace. For a drama which has a main character as a musician, there was so much wasted potential to not have a wider range of genres, styles and (respectfully )more Korean and international mainstream and indie artists throughout the show.

Perhaps Sweet Home’s one saving grace had to be its varied and brilliant cast. By far several of the best casting choices of the show had to be between choosing Lee Jin Wook as a gruff gangster, Go Min- Si as a foul-mouthed teenager with a surprising streak of kindness and of course casting Kim Sang Ho as Han Du- Sik , the much needed comical relief of the drama.

Yet the casting choices of our main leads were by far the most surprising. Knowing that Song Kang( who played one of the cheerful leads in the romance hit-drama Love Alarm ) would be cast to play the suicidal and angst-ridden teen Hyun, seems a strange fact to grasp with for most viewers, yet, Kang’s portrayal added a surprisingly level of humanity to the irony of playing a character fighting for that very sake. In a similar manner, Lee Do Hyun was fairly unrecognisable in a guise of glasses and a more mature role as Lee- Eun Hyuk than a certain “ Ahjussi teenager “ in the romance- comedy 18 Again , yet like his costar, Do- Hyun was fairly good in the drama.

Overall, Sweet Home has certainly been one of the better dramas of 2020 with a fairly good and original concept ( although it does fall down on several factors), difficult themes (such as murder and suicide) being tackled in an appropriate manner and a stellar and diverse cast. My only other complaint is with the ending already trying to build its way to another season ( or leave on a “ dramatic” cliffhanger) and therefore consequently trying to stray away from the original storyline. Apart from this ( as we are still yet to see if there is another season or not) , Sweet Home ( although not flawless) is definitely worth a watch.

Best Watched Without Minding the Original Material
This is not a 'genuine' adaptation of Sweet Home. More like a 'loose' one but yes this wasn't anything like the webtoon with how they selectively only take the idea of monsters appearing out of nowhere, with people surviving amidst of it and a boy who's happened to be able to resist the monster inside his head, and turns it into a 10-episode show. They lose the essence of original material when they decided end this show with that ending. It's pretty obvious that they're planning to further utilize the core story of the original material to create a seasonal work, judging how different the route it takes throughout the story. You'll be disappointed if you read the webtoon because many characters are not the same, some are added for no reason, and suddenly this turns into a usual apocalyptic story with a supposedly hero to 'save' humanity. What the webtoon tries to rely is beyond that. Both works are straight up different in terms of characters' growth & plot progression.

Not to mention the way the show placed its background music is just plain disastrous. The webtoon gives off suspenseful & eerie vibes whenever the monster's around, while at the same being unsettling in peeling out the layer of the main question of the whole thing: what does it mean to be a human, or a monster?It talks about greed, desire, and everything beyond that. The music (and the plot, I might need to say) fails to deliver that, and instead turn on the ever-repetitive song to made the whole scene more 'exciting' when it's supposed to elicit fear and anxiousness from ones who watch it. Not only it disturb the mood the whole scene was particularly going for, it also ruined the suspenseful vibes it tries so hard to build by suddenly making this more looking like an entertaining action-focused story. Which is wrong (and ridiculous) because the monster's supposed to be a real & full-blown horror to all the survivors. It's supposed to make you feel afraid and nervous, which it ultimately failed to be at the end.

This is best watched as a separate work, rather as an adaptation. Because it's clearly not being faithful to what the original material aims for, and it will further prevent you from experiencing it to its best quality. Once I let go my expectation that I've long had due to my deep attachment to the webtoon, Sweet Home as an entire piece is still a good watch for what it's worth. Song Kang was impeccable as Hyun-soo despite the minimal effort the show put to build his personal growth. Go Min-si & Park Kyu-young was great, the entire casting line-up has been nothing but incredible, really. And Lee Do-hyun!Brilliant as ever.

Speaking of directing, considering it was done by Lee Eun-bok who also brought Mr. Sunshine & Goblin, I think there's not much to worry about. Everything's exquisitely done and the action scenes are well-executed to say the least. Although I feel like the nosebleed scenes are too much sometimes lmfao. A lot of gory scenes are shown here, but nothing explicit. I wasn't a fan of gore, but still handles this just fine. Really loved the bits where they shown the 'monstrous' version of Hyun-soo near the finale, by the way. Short but impactful for sure.

Sweet Home is, all in all, a decent show. It's fast-paced, thrilling, and heartwarming at times it need to be. Admittedly there's a serious lack of character development shown toward several major characters, but this is an action drama at its best. You'll enjoy it better if you treat it as something it tries to be, that's all. Anyways, if you haven't read the webtoon, please read it, before or after you watch the show. It was that good. Enjoy the show nonetheless!

Don't compare, just enjoy.
I honestly enjoyed this.
The monsters were interesting (and sometimes even funny). The plot was well executed but you do need to keep in mind that though this is an adaptation of the manhwa/webtoon that doesn't mean it'll be the same scene by scene. This had in a way more depth than it's comic version. You feel a lot closer to each character. But you can watch this without knowing anything about the original webtoon.

Also, need to say I'm a fan of gore so if you get queasy at the sight of blood then you should probably stay away from this...

The CGI was obvious most of the time but in a way that you didn't really care. The story and acting sucked you in and the rest just looked cool or something along those lines ^.^
(also actors/actresses were really pretty so it was easy on the eyes ...Unless you count the monsters... and the blood... Actually, this was pretty rough on the eyes... The PEOPLE in this were pretty?)
Loved the stunts! Everything looked so real! I can just imagine the fun they had filming this.

It was so easy to watch that I accidentally on purpose binge watched this (the whole season) <3
But that can also just be because I was already familiar with the story and waited for this.
There were some funny easter eggs included for the fans. The music was rather random but I suppose it matched the mood.

I'm not entirely sure because my memory is sh*t but I feel like they created new characters for this but please don't trust me on that... The story was definitely different (slightly?).

To those that hate to watch stuff online for free (totally illegally) then your in luck.
You can find the whole season on Netflix.

Anyway definitely recommend this! Have fun~

Decent drama adaptation
> STORY
Given that the drama was set to have 10 episodes, I understand that there would be a lot to fit in if they were going to do an adaptation of a webtoon that has over 140 chapters. Still, I did hope that the changes they make would fit in such a way that the drama would make sense even for those who have not read the webtoon. In this case, well... Let's just say that the 'Sweet Home' drama adaptation is like a ""longer movie adaptation"" of the webtoon. I expected it to be very fast-paced all throughout, but I did find that there were times where it felt a bit slow.

The story, as they have changed it slightly, I felt was lacking and a bit all-over the place. Even when I knew that some bits were similar from the webtoon, I still couldn't help but feel a bit confused. First of all, why the hell are there so many surviving tenants in a 10 episode about humans being hunted by their desires? You would expect that with having too many characters to pay attention to that each of them has their own story to tell. But because of the episode limitation, a whole lot of the characters have not been to fleshed out -- even the supposed main characters themselves. If this was going to happen, I would much rather that they got rid of others quickly either by being consumed by their desires, killed by the other tenants, or eaten by the monsters. If this were a zombie movie where the bitten humans become zombies themselves right after, I wouldn't mind at all because we all know how that would go down.

My point is that the story is meant to be different in that the cause of the chaos in their world is psychological and emotional, which therefore means that having a deeper connection with the characters might weigh a lot more. (Because yes, we did get some background story and some struggle with some of the characters, but it still somewhat lacking in depth, in my opinion.) This is why I could not help but feel that the drama is a little confused about how it wants to be. Should it be like the other fast-paced zombie/monster pandemic stories? Or should it stay close to the webtoon's story? Or should it be like a mash of the two and a whole lot more? The addition of a new element in the story made it all the more confusing to me -- is the cause of this chaos biological? Psychological? Emotional? Evolutionary? Did someone plot this whole chaos? Was it an accident? Is this about weaponizations? Or what -- is this like COVID??? What is going?? In the end, they have chosen the option of having a possible second season to hopefully try and make sense of whatever happened this season.

> CAST (and MONSTERS)
The story aside, the actors did very well in portraying their roles. Even though the characterisation was lacking, it was still passable and the actors brought some life to their characters that would make you want to cheer for them. I actually thought that the makeup, special effects, and CGI weren't so bad for a drama that tries to bring life to monsters. Very good effort! If anyone is not a fan of horror, it would be best to skip those monster bits.

There was enough action in this 10-episode drama and while I was hoping for more monsters, what they have given us was enough. You wouldn't be disappointed in this aspect. I also liked the setting that they've chosen to be the Green Roof Apartments and the details that went into it; each apartment and their tenants have different stories after all. (This is why I was hoping that if they were to adapt this particular story that either 1. They spread it out in different seasons -- but given the costs for this to even be adapted, I highly doubt they'll go for this route. 2. They write it in such a way that makes sense for a 10-episode drama.)

> MUSIC
As for the music, I feel that they could have chosen better? I mean... I do not mind 'Warriors' by Imagine Dragons, but I just thought that they really had plenty of other songs to choose from? I don't know, I think it's just me. Other than that, the music sound effects and such were not too bad.

> Would I watch this again?
I wouldn't mind watching it again, it was a fun ride watching it the first time :)

> Would I recommend this drama to others?
Yes, especially if you like monsters and zombies films/dramas. Also the quality and acting in this drama is good! It would not disappoint you. (Unless of course, you are like me who is reading too much into trying to make sense of the story then... Well... It's up to you!)

Wow Mr.Sunshine’s director...just wow
If I have to describe this drama in one word, I’ll say ‘excellence’. It was excellent in every aspect, from the direction, characters’ arc, casting, cinematography, background score...not much CGI, but that can be disregarded for all other well-executed aspects.

If you come to it expecting gore, monsters eating people, or just your fav actors pulling off a great performance, you’ll definitely get that, but along with it you'll get attached to the character, feel for them, cry, and root for their survival.

This drama never failed to deliver on its genre of intense psychological, horror, and thriller, but what it explored is something way deeper, the question of “Who is human and who is humane?”
Monsters that help and protect people, but are still monsters or humans who harm others more than monsters themselves. The line between what moral ethics detect and what the survival instinct imposes is blurred. Sometimes, you’ll find yourself rooting that the characters do something that is morally wrong just so they can survive, and other times you’ll want them just to do the right thing morally even if it can get them killed.

This drama was a rollercoaster of twists, emotions, and character development. It’s not the type of horror shows where you know that the mains can’t get killed. It will keep you on edge, waiting, suspecting, and praying that your favorite characters won’t be harmed. At this point, I must admit that is primarily a character-driven show. The characters’ arc and their interactions between them is the soul of the drama. There are no bad or good residents. They all wanna survive, and you can’t really judge their actions because, in the end, it’s their life that is at stake. I loved and empathized with every main character. From my precious church boi, Jaehun, that was the embodiment of goodness, sacrifice for others, and sword skill to the hella fine gangster guy with a soft heart. The women in the show were impeccable. From the badass, fighter Yi Kyung, the bitchy Eun Yoo, the caregiver, and Ji Su to the amazing ahjummas that stole the show. The great thing about the characters is that they weren’t the know it all, untouchable type. They were vulnerable, doubted themselves, and didn’t know what to choose between survival or what’s right to do. Knowing the characters and their backstories took the show to another level as we got to understand where they came from and why they are doing what they are doing.

The drama also dealt with heavy topics, from bullying, child abuse, self-harm, suicide, the unjust justice system to grieving the loss of loved ones. It was heartbreaking in many instances and surprisingly heartwarming at others. The subtle hinted kinda romances warmed my heart and killed me at the same time. Needless to say, the acting was phenomenal. Every actor involved in the drama did a great job of staying true to the character.

As for the bad points, some may say VFX and CGI were lacking, especially the monsters’ design, and them running while shouting PROTEIN. I find it more comedic than scary, but it is what it is, a minor bad thing in the sea of great things the drama has to offer.

Overall, it was a great drama experience, a rollercoaster of emotions, attachment, thrill, and ugly cries. Kudos to Mr. Sunshine’s director for entertaining me and breaking my heart here and there.

A strange one
It's hard to give an opinion on this show... I liked it but at the same time I didn't.

First lets set something straight, the CGI was really bad, people saying that's very good haven't watched a proper CGI movie. While I know that the budget in such shows is not so massive as Hollywood it's no excuse to use bad CGI and call it good in current days. In the first episodes the monsters looked really fake, but as the show continued they were ""fixed"" a little to look more mashed in the scenery and with proper lighting.

The story was interesting... but at the same time dumb. How can I describe it... it's like giving a great script but to people who don't understand how to implement it. The show was trying to be too cool and it felt like it overdid so it actually looked like an elementary kid playing a ""hero"" game.

So it's really strange... I didn't hate the story but the way it was portrayed was too childish.

The music... I know they love to reuse the same song on k-dramas but I think the specific song selection was not proper for a lot of the ""epic"" scenes with that ""warriors"" song on repeat. Each time I heard it, it killed the scene for me...

The ending of the first part (I assume) was all over the place, so I don't consider it to be a ""good"" one.

While I don't consider it a bad show if I take in consideration the bad CGI, bad director vision and the strange music choice I can't give it more than 6/10, while I have given 6 to a lot worse shows than this and I don't consider this one to be equally bad to them.

Or to break it in other terms, as a SciFi show is really bad, but as a kdrama is OK.

Lowkey kinda disappointing
Sweet Home is - I think - my second ever Korean drama that I watched which did not fit under the romance genre in some way or another. I, like many others, watched this kdrama solely because I read and finished the Webtoon. I absolutely loved the depth that the Webtoon gave all of these characters, however none of that transferred to the drama. The characters felt hollow, and while they did have some backstories, it wasn’t nearly as intricate as it was in the original version. This led to the characters’ motivations being somewhat unclear in parts of the drama. This type of story is simply way too complex to be condensed into 10 50-minute episodes, and I would have at least made this drama 16 episodes had I been one of the people working on it. While we’re on the topic, I also have to say that I wish the drama elaborated a lot more on the monster power, especially as it pertained to Hyun Su and the other infected guy that was with the group of raiders. If I hadn’t already been aware of the monsters’ powers because I had read the Webtoon, I would have been HELLA confused with this drama. I think I’ve heard this complaint already, but this drama has some dope-as-hell songs in its soundtrack that just sound absolutely WRONG in the scenes that they are played in. While I enjoy an epic Imagine Dragons moment, it just never really fit in with the haunting atmosphere that the drama was supposed to have. It completely ruined some crucial scenes and made me almost click off the episode. Some of the creative liberties the writers took, such as adding in some characters which weren’t in the original Webtoon, were quite nice, actually. I very much enjoyed the budding romance of Hyun Su and the ballerina girl, for instance. However, I wish the writers hadn’t cut out some parts of the Webtoon and completely changed the drama’s ending. They had instead left the ending extremely open and confusing, and now I’m not sure whether or not they are planning a second season. The reason I watch korean dramas is first and foremost because I’m so sick of the open ended nature of endings in western television shows. Waiting for season after season to come out is frustrating as heck, so I completely made the switch to Korean dramas because they always air for only one season and end the story. I hate that Netflix is considering the possibility of extending their korean dramas for several seasons, because this very thing is what turns me off from their other shows (*cough* stranger things *cough*). Anyway, I’d have to be honest and say that there are countless other dramas I could recommend that are so much better than this one, and, frankly, I had much higher hopes for this, given the amazing storyline the writers had to work with. Would not recommend.

one heck of a ride
sweet home is a drama that didn't fail to hit the right spots in terms of action, characters with depth, comical moments and with all these aspects, you have chills running down your spine when you ask, ""what is it to be human? when do we stop being human? are we really all just monsters pretending to be human?""

what i absolutely loved about this drama is that all the characters are not perfect. some of them may seem outlandish at first but a few episodes later the viewer is given an understanding of the underlying reasons behind their actions. you have characters who may seem well put together but are just trying their best to survive by burying unwanted memories. sure, they make mistakes. what's amazing is the other characters showing support and care because they all want to make it out alive together.

to say i didn't cry is a lie. the emotions this show radiates is extraordinarily wonderful. it may be blood (cdramas are quaking) and gore but the friendships portrayed are beautiful that you can't help your heart from shattering to a million pieces.

p.s. i think brendon urie is here (lol jk)

It's not for EVERYONE.
[As I said in the title it's not a drama that everyone would love cause there is too much blood, violence, monsters, deaths, and many other things so if you are not into horror shows then don't watch it, it will be a nightmare for you.]
It was just a warning for soft-hearted people, so now let's talk about my opinion about this drama. I would say it was freaking, hella awesome it just blew my mind, I'm in still shock now what I have watched. The cast was amazing, their acting was brilliant, felt the emotions and I loved the fact that they showed us even side character's side stories in the short period of 10 episodes, the character development was amazing they literally showed us every character journey and personality development. Many people think that the title of the show is irrelevant but in my opinion, it's not at all because after surviving together they become like a family that's what you call family. The ML seemed to be shady in the first but after knowing his backstory we can understand him. The special effects were awesome it's kind of obvious being the most expensive show, loved the sound effects they give you chills, actually, I liked every aspect of the drama.

This drama can be the definition of a thriller and it's not just a thriller it's emotional too it makes you cry also so it's also exploded with lots of emotions.

I would never have watched this drama cause it's not my usual genre but I'm glad I watched it, it was indeed a great experience to try something new, different out of your comfort zone that's how you explore. So this drama was full package for me I literally watched it in one go cause it's worth it, I gave less re-watch valuelessly because it's not the show that you can re-watch again, I never give high ratings but it made me do it. It would have been 10 if there were fewer cliffhangers in the end but I still think it was kind of obvious for this kind of drama.

Basically, it doesn't reveal many secrets I think we will have to wait for season 2, but still, the fact that story wasn't complete, I loved it! if you are a sucker for a good plot, good acting, thriller, action, horror then it's definitely piece of cake.

Waiting for season 2!!!

Surprisingly boring
I've heard good reviews prior to watching this show and maybe I had my expectations too high. However, this drama disappointed me. Sadly, instead of being scary and captivating, it was boring and sometimes unintentionally funny. The special effects didn't impress me either. The character development does not work well. As far as horrors are concerned, I found ""Kingdom"" much better, as well as the movie ""Train to Busan"". I do not recommend this show to anyone. The rewatch value for me is close to zero. The ending implies there's going to be season 2. I'm not looking forward to it.

Home Sweet Home
Studio Dragon’s Sweet Home is the live-action adaptation of Naver’s eponymous webtoon. Based on many viewers’ feedback, it seems that both the original source material and drama are equally fantastic yet slightly different as well. I haven’t read the webtoon but having watched the drama, I would have to agree – it certainly doesn’t disappoint. Along with Alice in Borderland, also distributed by Netflix, Sweet Home became the most talked about show for a period of time in December 2020 not only here at MDL but also globally – it currently ranks in the top 5 in the US and number 1 in 13 other countries, according to statistics. And for good reasons too, apart from being accessible on a major international streaming platform.

As it turned out, what I initially thought was a horror drama that was purely about monsters with thrilling action and suspense actually had a lot more going. What the trailers, vivid posters and edgy soundtrack compilation didn’t reveal was that Sweet Home was also a story about humanity, and the baggage of people issues that come along with it. I finally understood why 10 episodes (not including the potential sequel) were needed for this show.

This is a very well-crafted adaptation with an experienced cast of many familiar faces, stellar production crew, big budget CGIs, and outstanding cinematography, art direction, action choreography as well as excellent screenplay filled with well-written and colourful characters brought to life by superb all-round acting. It is directed by Lee Eung Bok, who helmed Mr Sunshine, Goblin, and Descendants of the Sun being the notable ones. The music score is composed by Gaemi, whose works include Mystic Pop-Up Bar, The King: Eternal Monarch, The World of the Married, and DotS, among many others. The visual effects are provided by Legacy Effects, VFX Studio Westworld and Spectral Motion, all of which worked on well-known productions such Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Films), Avatar, Game of Thrones and Stranger Things.

As for the main cast, there’s Lee Jin Wook (Voice 2 and 3), Lee Shi Young, Lee Do Hyun, and Park Gyu Young among the more well-known. The supporting cast comprises veterans such as the more familiar ones like Kim Nam Hee, Kim Gab Soo, Kim Sang Ho, Woo Hyun, and Park Sung Geun. The main character is played by the talented youngster, Song Kang in his second lead role.

In summary, the drama tells the story of how a group of inhabitants of an apartment building, Green Home (interestingly the apartment complex itself had a greenish tint), survive a monster apocalypse. How the monsters came about, let’s just say it’s not a natural evolution although some viewers may probably debate this. We see the best and worst of humanity in each and every single character of the show as they struggle to survive this disaster. In many respects, the characters likely mirror real life people that we meet in our day to day lives, for no monster is truly as horrifying as people themselves once they succumb to their inner darkness. At least, that’s my takeaway from this show. Each character has his or her own respective backstory, whose present lives are shaped by varying levels of tragedy and trauma of their past, which now intersect as they are forced to team up and face the onslaught of monster attack.

As far as character portrayals go, my personal favourites are Lee Jin Wook’s Pyeon Sang Wook, Park Gyu Young’s Yoon Ji Su, Go Min Si’s Lee Eun Yoo, and Kim Nam Hee’s Jung Jae Heon. For the supporting cast, Kim Sang Ho’s Mr Han, Woo Hyun and Kim Hyun as the shopkeeper and his wife respectively, were equally phenomenal. The characterisations adapted for the screenplay are immensely elevated by the excellent acting of these actors in particular. The depth and richness of each respective character arc and development, the deft execution and quality delivery of myriad emotional expressions, these were my major personal highlights from the drama.

As well-made and well-acted as this production is, where most of the cast brought their A-game and the special effects were truly exceptional, to me it wasn’t as close to flawlessness as it might have seemed to many viewers. I certainly enjoyed it but not as much as I had anticipated or hoped, possibly due to the immense hype that snowballed from prior to its official release up to the point of completion of airing.

The storytelling would have probably worked better with a shorter season of perhaps 8 or so episodes, (case in point, both seasons of Kingdom which had 6 episodes each) with a more compelling plot, sustained momentum and intensity by balancing the dramatic, thrilling and poignant moments. As it is, particularly from the mid-section to nearing the end with the sudden introduction of new characters, the additional build up felt dragged. It’s a case of each character being “fleshed out over excessively”. The pain, sorrow, fears and insecurities kept being reinforced incessantly throughout to the point of being rendered mere iterations, when discerning viewers have already utterly understood the message and underlying tone of human drama and tragedy being conveyed. Confrontations between characters and internal conflicts were magnified for maximum effect much longer than was necessary while the finale, when it eventually transpired and as thrilling as it was, wasn’t as satisfying or “epic” as it could’ve been to bring closure to this first season and more importantly, entice us viewers or at least me to higher levels of excitement in anticipating the follow-up season.

Regardless of the issues I personally felt, on the whole Sweet Home still remains a top tier production and a “viewing event” that’s very much worth a watch (and re-watch) and to a certain extent warrants the hype that accompanies it. It still could have been so much more and there remains vast potential to this series, so hopefully the second season would be even greater.

This review may contain spoilers
a really really unique drama, I guess in some ways drama writers take their products too lightly, and maybe since webtoon writers how a bigger deadline and medium they work harder on building their world, that's why this was perfect

for me the best part was the characters, each one was different, each one had their good and bad qualities, and each had a worth and a purpose for the story lines.


for me, Kim Nam Hee, Lee Shi Young, Park Gyu Young, Lee Do Hyun had the best acting performance, the rest of course did a great job, but these 4 really outdid their past works and it was a pleasure to watch them.

personally, I think Song Kang and Go Yoon Jung were their weakest links acting-wise, their characters were great (especially those bows, and the last fight) but their acting had a flat side, especially with the delivery of their dialogues.


my top 2 characters were Jae Heon and Yi Kyung.. I'll never forgive the director for killing my favorite characters ;( I get that he was too perfect for them, in the last 2eps things would've been different if he was still around, he was rational, calm but he was a man of action especially if his friends were involved...
I wish his death was a little more dramatic but agh the director was enjoying it so much that he went back and punch me one last time with the start of ep9 TT_TT



the cgi was HORRIBLE, the gore was ridiculous -those waterfall bloods were funny- the sounds were infuriating and they didn't only make a character chew gum and talk but they highlighted the sound so much, I HATE that ;)



aannnyyway, the OSTs were nice, the filmography and the scenery was beautiful but the best part was jaeheon's fighting scenes, I wish they were longer..


I never rewatch stuff but I'll wait for the 2nd season~ they better make it!

From a Webtoon fan...
Disclaimer: this review is biased. I have been reading this webtoon ongoing right after it came out several months after I finished reading Bastard. I don't like horror but these authors are amazing! I'm a huge fan of this webtoon and was waiting for a new chapter each week, and even bought some early access. So I was veeeery disappointed in the drama... but if you are a webtoon reader like me, try to not compare this to it, and just enjoy the drama as a standalone, even though i know that it will be hard.

There are spoilers in the review if you didn't read the webtoon. So better to not read it.

Side Note for those who don't like Horror like me: Even though the drama was creepy and disgusting, you could easily close your eyes at the most disgusting parts like excessive blood flow or killings/eatings and still enjoy the show.

STORY:
the Bad:
They changed everything from the very start.. They removed Maria, they completely changed Eunhyuk's sister, they took away Eunhyuk's nerdy side, they added a completely new character who is a strong woman firefighter, They focused more on the outside world, while the webtoon focused only on the residents of this place and from their perspective (the characters didnd't know what was going on, just like us), they changed the group of evil people that barged into their apartment complex, They changed Wook and his profession, they changed Dusik's ending (his end was soooooooooooooooo dramatic and special in the webtoon, i was crying my eyes out but here it wasn't), They removed the ""NEW"" people, they changed the old man fighter girl duo, They changed the overall ending leaving it open for the second season, they added romance where it wasn't and removed romance from where it was, They breezed through some of the important side characters. Not only that, they also didn't focus much on people's thought process when becoming a monster. The inner fight was less, the chemistry between characters was just shoved down to 0. Eunhyuk Hyun, Wook, Jisoo friendship was my favorite but they just removed it completely. This webtoon was one of the best webtoon with character growth and this was not shown well too. Anyway it just seemed that they are making money on the webtoons name, taking the core idea and doing it completely differently.
The Good:
Now if you take this as a standalone and forget about the webtoon. The characters were interesting, the new firefighter girl was cool and she did a lot for the story progress, the showed us some of the reasons why this started happening making it a big conspiracy. Including military and showing us what they are doing too. So we get more information and the thing becomes much bigger. Some great characters were so perfect that they became scene stealers.

Acting/Cast:
the bad: the bad goes not into the acting but the cast, some didn't suit the characters, like Wook. and some were just made up out of nowhere.
the good: the good is of course the acting, because everyone did a great job with it! amazing performance by everyone!
SOUNDTRACK: Warriors by Imagine Dragons? XD well i like the song so it was nice and epic but kinda unexpected and not very suited.

I never rewatch dramas. So i put a random number in there.

Overall:
Compared to the webtoon, this show is very bad. If i was a webtoon writer i would have been enraged.
But if you watch it separate from the webtoon it is good and interesting.

JUST AMAZING
I finished it in one day. I had no plan whatsoever to watch it nor what the story was about but after I saw this popping up on my Netflix I couldn’t resist but click on it. The cast is so good, let me tell you. Every single one of the characters (humans and monsters) are so well thought and the actor deserve so much praise. Lee Dohyun and Song Kang seemed so mature and real after all the romcoms it was almost refreshing.

They made me cry, think and just love the whole concept. As I always say, I love sci-fi, dystopian and post apocalyptic stuff so much although I always cry but honestly it’s so necessary to watch something raw and “real” every now and then. The ending left so much room for a possible season 2 and I’m really excited at the thought.

For those who are planning to watch it, do it. It can get bloody, scary, disgusting and very emotional throughout but it’s really one of the best kdramas I watched this year. What a wonderful binge worthy finish to this year!


*Fans of Alice in Borderland, Alive, Kingdom and similar will really love this*

Webtoon reader, biased review
I already know the webtoon is amazing: the plot, characters, concept, creepiness, comedy, relationship, gore, sadness, etc...everything is perfect for me, I can feel every bit of emotion the webtoon tries to deliver. And this drama just makes the webtoon ×100 better.

The bad CGI, the way they change the characters and their relationships just doesn't stand well with me, they just feel less connected and the drama show less on how the ML fight/resist the inner monster (it doesn't really show that it's very difficult to ressist the monster) he just suddenly have power and how ridiculous of him to went up and down to get their stuff while the other monsters are there. In the webtoon, the ML is just infected human being with no power, he just go berserk when he lose control of the demon or become monster when he succumbed to the demon at the end. Talking about the ML, his character is just plain and dull in the drama, he don't fight for himself (he does fight the monster but not human) and they can just use him however they want. I don't like the gangster too, they make him look like he is invincible (like he can easily fight the monster and can go wherever he wants in the building). This drama would have been much better if they focus more on the monsters/ inner monster than humans. Most of the characters in this drama is just so unlikable (not to say there are none in the webtoon, there are hateful ones but they just add to the creeps of the webtoon). There are still some characters I find annoying but I'll just stop here, if not it will be never ending...

I just think it's funny throughout the drama instead of feeling intense or scary (since it's a horror genre). I don't get why the name is ""sweet home"" for this drama, the webtoon has a very touching meaning for it so i recommend everyone to read the webtoon to understand more in depth of the story (but they literally change everything from the webtoon so.... idk which do you prefer). There are people who like the changes but definitely not me. Maybe because they want to make a season 2 but it just so sad that many of the main characters died and other useless characters which contribute nothing to the plot lives.
Maybe because i read the webtoon first so i think the drama is silly, but it's better experience for people who watch the drama first...i guess

Won't rewatch, definitely not excited for season 2 too

R.I.P my soul
Is this the part where I admit this show starting from episode one made me nearly dive behind my couch in fear screaming ""WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!""

I finished this show the other day and I can honestly say I still have no idea what to say. My brain is clearly static noise of insane fangirling. I see a lot of people liking it, and just as many disliking it. Still not sure how you can hate this show because of the ""bad CGI"" ekrhgerhreiue WHERE?! Lol Okay okay, I know, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Guess my inner fangirl just doesn't understand. Lol I thought everything about it was fantastic and had never been done before, honestly. I mean I'm a huge horror buff and this is the first show I have ever had made me actually scared. Okay, I'm sorry but that thing from episode one took me by surprise and I'm almost sure I'm sitting here as a ghost not realizing that scene actually killed me. Lol O_O

I don't think there was anything I disliked about this show because it really showed what I think the end of the world would be like. Not to mention, they covered every type of person and that takes a lot of skill to put all of that together in such a small place. And can we please talk about the setting!? They used one building through most of the show and made every episode unique as hell! THAT IS TALENT! The writers, designers, actors all deserve awards. lol Even the ones I hated with a passion (old abusive man, I'm lookin at you - freaking hated this man's character so much)

While I still have a lot of questions -- I'm sure I'll never get answers to, I really did love this show. I'm actually really shocked because it's rare that I see a preview and think ""Holy crap I can't wait to see this!!"" and it actually deliver on being as badass as they show in the previews. This show delivered and went WAY beyond my expectations. I can't wait for season 2! (I really hope we get it soon. Lol)

WATCH IT NOW!
I would like to start by saying I have not read the webtoon and thus I’ll judge the story and characters as showcased in the drama. I would also ensue a trigger warning as the show depicts serious topics like Suicide, self harm and violence- so bear this in mind if you decide to watch.

Without spoiling too much, the show focuses on the characters and their reactions and emotions in this life threatening situation they are put in. It is how they come together to fight monsters- outside and the ones within. Each character comes with their own backstory and ALL characters are interesting and well-written. They put in a good amount of money and the monsters look convincing even though the CGI is evident. I was pretty impressed! (If you’re worried about them being scary, don’t be- those are not what might scare you or scar you while watching the show)

Each actor does a bang-on job and you feel connected to most of them inspite of the show being 10 episodes.

The ending of the show leaves space for season 2 and I do hope they come out with one. Even if they don’t, one can interpret the last few scenes in various ways so if you aren’t a fan of an open ending this part might not sit well with you.

I really liked the background score at most times but whenever Warriors played, I felt like the song used for those parts could have varied- however it doesn’t take away from what the scene tried to portray so I won’t complain much on that front.

All in all I highly recommend the show and I assure you, you’ll be happy you took out your time and gave it a chance!

What a series
I never expected that this series would turn up like this first of all hats off to all the crew worked on this CAST
Ist song Kang he literally nailed it ,I haven't expected that much from him,but he proven himself especially the last episode,he played very well
Lee do hyun unlike song kang I have watched his dramas before he is a well versed actor
He played the character that kept the entire drama on a reality check like even though he seems like a emotionless guy but he just trying to survive with others
Lee jin wook he is just so good with action scenes his character development along the series is so observable
Lee Shi young she is so cool, her character in this series seems so ruthless and stuff but she is soft inside
Even though there are some things that I didn't understood like the ending I am not gonna spoil that
There are some charecter that are unforgettable especially the sword guy he is such a good actor and eun hyuk's sister and ahjusshi who makes weapons
There are annoying charecters and some fillers like a gang seems like they kept them for another episode at first I thought like that but it's not like that
See it so u will understand it
Music is kinda creepy cause the genre is horror
VFX and CGI are very well done

MAAAN WATCH IT!! RIGHT. NOW.
UHH-MAAAZINNNG!!! storyline? the best. cinematography? on point. acting? top notch! the storyline keeps me curious on what will happen next and I can't stop watching it. at first I thought it was thriller drama like strangers from hell or kingdom, but I was wrong. the drama also portrayed relationship and humanity, questioning 'to what extent are you a human?'. It has heartwarming and emotional scene, and yes I cried :')). I looooveee every single character, having different backstory, are imperfect yet I understand them. I wish they could show more in depth relationship between each character though. Oh andd, the monsters look really real, cgi was great. There are lots of gore and disgusting parts too. I advice not to eat while watching it (well I can't).

anyway, watch it guyss!! RIGHT NOWW!! it was amazing and I need season 2 :))))

DEFINETELY A MUST WATCH!!!!!!
Im gonna try to keep this review as short as possible. Ok so this is my first time ever writing a review on mydramalist because ive been so unmotivated to write some for the kdramas Ive watched but this...i just had too!! I am usually into romance kdramas and romcom and I am not really a big fan of horror so I was a bit skeptical about this at first. But as soon as I watched the first episode I was drawn in and fell inlove with the plots and themes. Even though this is a bit graphic for me, thats what I loved about it. There isnt any Kdrama like this! It goes into depth about Hyunsu's life and how special he is unlike the other infected. I think that this whole monster apocalypse really showcased his capabilities and how his life isnt completely ruined because he met some good people.

The story talks about how Hyunsu moved into this strange apartment when things started to change and people started to turn into monsters, while Hyun Soo and other residents try to survive. Boy let me tell you, this drama was an emotional rollercoaster! It made me cry so many times following the tragic deaths of my favorite people and it felt very heartwarming at times where they showed hints of love and romance between many characters. The story keeps you drawed in from episode one that you want to keep watching more! Lets not mention the fact that they left the viewers curious about the huge cliffhanger at the end! The chaos and blood from every scene was so captivating and realistic!

Dont even get me started on the cast and their acting! The emotions they put into their acting makes everyone understand the struggle that they were going through trying to fight off the monsters and survive. In the drama, Hyunsu was a really introverted guy who kept his emotions inside and resented many people but as we move on in the drama, we learn that he is actually a caring person with a big heart willing to sacrifice himself to help anyone survive especially the ones he got closer to. Same goes with Sangwook, he appears to be a gangster in the drama but later on we discover that he just needed support and to be loved. He has never experienced such before but he makes the viewer understand that he is not a bad guy. I really loved Yikyung in the drama, we rarely see women so brave and determined like her. She is a firefighter and anyone could tell from her strength and heroic actions. Let me also include that she is very fit and isnt afraid of anything or anyone that comes in her way. Eunhyuk is a person who never backs down on his words, whether his words are hurtful or educational. Eunhyuk stays calm in every situation and always has a backup plan. He is the type to not show his emotions but rather gives it to us through words. I wanted to only cover the main characters but I feel like Jisu and Eunyoo both played a huge role in the drama! They both are stubborn bad asses who isnt afraid to speak their mind, which I really love about them. They both went through tragic events in the past but that didnt stop them from persevering.

I am a fan of Imagine Dragons and I felt that their song really fit in well theme of the drama. It gives a rock vibe that makes the viewer intrigued even more. It gives us the idea that it is worth fighting to survive and it fits so well that I cant even explain it! I would definitely rewatch it! I never rewatch kdramas but THIS IS A MUST WATCH AGAIN! I cant wait for season 2 that it has me thinking about it all day! Honestly the best Kdrama of 2020 by far!

Great show with bad CGI
Sweet Home South Korean Fantasy Horror Drama Directed by one of the best kdrama directors in history Lee Eung Bok person who directed Mr.Sunshine, Goblin, and Descendants of the sun. This is a popular webtoon adaptation by Netflix. First do not compare with Kingdom series. This show is the most expensive Netflix show made in South Korea so I had high expectations but after watching the trailer I was kinda disappointed. CGI monsters look likes garbage to me, yes in this series they look like PlayStation 2 game. That's the biggest weakens in this series. When it comes to practical effects they have done a great job. Sweet Home reminds me of Resident Evil and Train to Busan. The plot is good but there are few plot holes. This is not just another zombie drama because these monsters are not easy to kill and every each monster is very unique that's one of the main reasons for me to keep watch this series. I loved the cinematography and color grading. There are a lot of close-up shots. It reminds me of the dexter intro which is really awesome. This is the most aggressive kdrama I have ever watched, there is a lot of violence and blood. They have a top-notch cast for this series and there not going to disappoint you. Every character in this series felt real to me. there are a lot of character developments throughout the series. There were a few characters that I need a backstory for them. The soundtracks are good but there was imagine dragons song and I felt that is not necessary for the scenes. Overall this is a good show with a lot of entertainment and I hope they develop their CGI in the next seasons.

Nice build-up!
Initially, I was very skeptical about this drama because I do not usually watch supernatural dramas. However, I was pleasantly surprised because it turned out to be very good. The build-up was great, I haven't encountered such a neat storyline progression in a while. Unfortunately, most dramas start out strong and only get worse by the episode, however this only got better with time. The ending might have been my favorite part, which is a hard thing to achieve. It left me wanting a second season but was also satisfying enough so that it didn't feel incomplete. Of course, there were some things I didn't like or would have preferred if they'd been executed differently, but overall, I would definitely recommend this drama!

Can't wait for the second season.
At first I thought sweet home is a survival thriller drama. I never intended to actually watch it. But I did, and was so fucking into the story, setting and the characters.

The story focuses on the theme ""inner monsters"" awaken by your ""desires"". And I straight away dig that shit! I liked how the drama was so fucking eerie, even before the monsters come into picture.

The characters are the soul of the story. Sweet home does a great job to make the viewers connect with the characters. You hate some of them and fucking abhor the others. Until you get to know about their back stories and then you start to sympathize with them and even share their feelings.
It is fun to watch when the characters are in moral conflict. When the line between ""right"" and ""wrong"" gets blurred, you really look forward to see what the characters do in those kind of situations.

If the show wouldn't had gone a little fast paced at the last half episodes, I would have fucking loved it even more.

Now that I have finally finished watching the drama, I can't wait for the next season. That's why I am starting the manhwa (as it is adapted from a comic).

Humanity in the horror
I had heard this show was very good but I was reluctant to watch it. I don't do well with horror movies and I thought this show would be too scary/ violent for me. However, if you can handle shows like Supernatural and Stranger Things, this is barely bloodier. So I'd recommend it if you can handle a moderate amount of violence- it isn't really scary, just intense and bloody.

From the very start, this show managed to be exciting and really fun despite all the darkness and gore. The atmosphere and monsters provided the thrills and intensity I was hoping for, without being too scary. The show definitely gets pretty dark, but not so much in a depressing way. I was surprised at how emotional and touching the show was at times. I haven't watched much horror, but none of what I've watched managed to combine violent dread and beautiful moments like this show has. The show is about monsters, but it's even more so about humanity and what it really means to be human. Some of the worst violence is from people, but even amidst all the darkness there's selflessness and hope.

I was especially fond of the soundtrack. The music consistently heightened the intense atmosphere, and the emotional and beautiful ""Sweet Home"" by Yongzoo is one of my all time favorite ost's.

Even though I'm not even a fan of horror, Sweet Home has become one of my favorite shows. Would definitely recommend.

PLEASE PROCEED KNOWING THAT THIS SHOW HAS EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE AND GORE
""This was insanely good. I loved every minute of it. Seriously it was just awesome. I really love the webtoon and loved drama adaptation even more. A must watch. The cast was really well chosen. Song Kang will be added to my list of favorite actors. He portrayed Hyunsoo exactly as I'd imagine him being a real person. Lee Dohyun and Lee Jinwook fitted their characters greatly as well. We had added extra character too (firefighter). I loved how story unfolded differently from webtoon. I can't wait for season two & I really hope Eunhyuk made it out alive since his monsterization has started right before building collapsed. We all know Sangwook isn't the one who drove the truck but I hope his original consciousness will have some impact on behavior of the monster. I am honestly amazed. I think season two will detach from webtoon and be completely new thing. Once again, I can't wait.""

//

well this was someone's comment on the finale that i have taken. pretty much summed up what i feel except that the excessive gore and violence are really difficult to stomach at some scenes, sh*t.

i have to add that i keep reading comments about how the webtoon had more character depths between the survivors, and also stories of the monsters itself which kept my final score for this drama considerably average/good instead of great. but at the end of the day, this was seriously a very high budget, high tech production which meant they had to cut corners on the backstory to give screentime for the live action so i can totally respect that. i guess the insufficiency of this drama successfully makes me want to read the webtoon already which is a good, commendable thing LOL. i usually don't bother.

phenomenal acting on all fronts. Song Kang is so fckin enigmatic, and i loved that they introduced the badass firefighter girl as a new character in this, and they are going to build up on that in season 2.

for what it was, i can really appreciate this drama despite my initial doubts (i have no attachment whatsoever to Kingdom series). if you can group them in the same/similar genre, then i connect to this one A LOT MORE.

FAN OF SONG KANG FOR LIFE!!! BRAVO! the ending scene when Hyun Su was fighting the other half-monster who made him turn into one, reminds me of the final fighting scene in the exorcism movie that has Park Seo Joon and Woo Do Hwan in it. so so good!

and yes, Hyun Su is my favourite character in the drama and i think Song Kang was perfectly cast for the role. he's so pitiful and my heart always breaks for him. my boy is slayin' it!!!!

p/s wish it had an excessive violence and gore warning plastered all over the drama page. it's really no joke and i think it can be very triggering. i hope people who proceed, do so with caution. i certainly would have been better mentally prepared. sighh

Crazy series! Jesus Christ ... I wanted to drop it at Episode 3, because of the confusing storytelling and annoying characters. But I liked the action, the CGI, the premise, the music. I came back, and what an emotional ride it was! Crazy. I cried, I held my breath. It was incredible. At the end I felt in love with every single character. Some deaths were devastating. The ending was disappointing, though. They changed the storyline from the webtoon and made it look like there is a possibility for a season 2. It reminds me of Extracurricular where they also had an open end. I have no idea at this point if Netflix will produce a second season or not. If yes, I'm happy! If no, the ending is just confusing and leaves too many questions open.

Webtoon vs Kdrama
I did read the webtoon and with the very first episode I was kind of disappointed, though that didn't stop me from continuing the show. After the first episode, I enjoyed the show a lot more. I don't know if it was just me or that I kept connecting the show and the webtoon together... Anyways the show kept the true meaning of the webtoon which I really appreciate, because it was one my reasons why I love reading Sweet Home. The show also kept a lot of the characters the same with a little mix into it, meaning things were gonna be different from the webtoon. I liked that because I wouldn't be able to expect things to happen. The ending was also very different from the webtoon even though I loved reading that ending, I really loved the ending they did for the show. They left it more open meaning there could be a season 2, hopefully!
Overall It is a great show with a hidden meaning. If you do not like the first episode like me I recommend you try the second episode. I hope there is another season and everyone in the show did such a great job!

A monster series with big teeth and a bit of a limp
""What makes us human?"" is one of the biggest questions in any art medium and the zombie genre has made exploring this question one its most consistent themes. While ""Sweet Home"" is not a true zombie production, it shares enough characteristics to fall somewhere in that corner of horror entertainment. One of the common threads that pops up here is that sometimes the most evil beings are the ones that are still unaffected-on-the-outside humans. The twist, and it's a good one, is that not all the creatures that look like monsters are monsters.

It's particularly poignant with Song Kang's Hyun Soo who alternates between struggling with wanting to live and a battle to retain his humanity. Although there are some exceptional human vs. monster melee's, the high points of ""Sweet Home"" are unquestionably the quiet exchanges between Hyun Soon and Go Min Si's Eun Yoo. The quality of Song Kang's work tends to peak and valley and this is definitely among his finest performances. It does falter and the show does in general in the final two episodes as the first primary arc pushes to a resolution while setting up the next act.

The crew has put together a mostly excellent package of special effects, sound and camera work. There's a couple of instances of less convincing cgi that detract but it's a minor distraction.

It's a fairly solid cast although only a few stand out with notable performances. Kim Gab Soo is one of them who exudes optimism balanced with knowledge of the grim reality. Lee Shi Young and Park Gyu Young both shine as strong women battling both personal emotional loss and deadly creatures.

A few holes emerge too. Although the setting is an apartment building in Seoul, there's not just a massive amount of people that never appear, but there's no attempt to explain their absence. Dozens (possibly?) of creatures appear outside the building in moments, but that still leaves millions in the city unaccounted for and scores within the building. Two mutants appear, one early and one late, that fall right on the human/monster line and seem ideal for additional attention, but don't receive it. Overall, the coherence of the narrative is uneven but the spotlight is focused enough for the most of the series. But when the plot has to expand to incorporate new introductions and beyond the group's struggle survive within the apartment building, the tension subsides and the flaws begin to protrude.

Some entries in this genre are must-watch even for viewers who aren't hardcore horror buffs. ""Sweet Home"" falls short of that bar, but it is an entertaining and, at times, compelling series. Whether it remains so in a follow-up season will require more disciplined storytelling as it appears multiple arcs will splinter off. And it may need more range and intensity from Song Kang than his body of work has shown he's capable of providing.

Worth the watch.
Honestly I have already rewatched this series so many times since the release. I have fallen in love with every character, every little detail is perfect. The monsters are just amazing, the effects and gore is completely perfect in my opinion. The acting itself was just stunning, i was hooked within the first 10 minutes. If you enjoy rollercoaster then expect your emotions to go for the ride of their lives. I was angry, laughing and crying during the 10 amazing episodes and i am seriously praying for a second season.

People say not to compare, but c'mon
I prefer the webcomic much more than this live action. I think the show was going for something that didn't really fit the story and setting.

The original webcomic was a bit more horror oriented. With spine-chilling moments and creepy stuff happening and is kinda slow paced. But I think it shot itself in the foot by going for this over-the-top, action hero kinda show and, how can we forget because it's practically stuck inside the head of everyone who watched the show, using the same goddamn song over and over again everytime something remotely big happens. ""Warriors"" is a good song, but now I just get annoyed everytime I hear it.

I think if they were going a lot slower, be a little more meticulous, and maybe not have some of the creatures have spasms all over their body at all times, and not turn into a Hollywood action film for some moments, the show would have worked quite a lot better. They went a bit too grandiose with some of the cinematics and action scenes in my opinion.

But still, credit where it's due, the acting itself throughout the show is pretty good. Semi-realistic, and sticking pretty close to the characters in the comic.

Would I recommend it? Sure. If you wanna watch an interesting horror-action show, go ahead. But I implore you, go read the webcomic after watching the show. You might think it's meh, you might think it's leagues better than the show.

I don't wanna be rude, but...
This was a bunch of bullshit. If anyone understoon even one thing about this story... that person is too smart for this world.
I have read the webtoon and that was amazing, but this series... I don't even know what i was watching... The only reason i'm not giving 1 star is beacuse of the music which was great. There is nothing more i can rate here.
Is there anyone who understood what this ending wanted to be without reading the webtoon? Is there anyone who understood the point of this story? Netflix should have told newbies to read the webtoon first because this series is just a extra for the fans (the worst one, tbh) and if someone haven't read it, they won't understand a thing. I'm disappointed and angry. It was a waste of time and ruined my favourite webtoon. Thanks. Really.

Lets first talk about hyun su past ,
I really cant imagine all of this...korean schools are really something...bullying is so common there, at least u should have a sensable reason but no he just helped him by giving coins and he in return ruined his whole life and thats the reason why i hate watchimg high school dramas , please bullies beat others for no reason and authorities play dumb there. For this reason i am really greatful that i live in sucha place where students dont judge each other by rich or poor or bully each other. Gosh, i really pity hyun su.
Okay so except that my favourite charactors were hyunsu, eun yoo, hyuk,yuri's grandpa and wook.
And some people watched it because of webtoon,some because of song kang(hyunsu) but i watched it because of yoon ji soo(the guitarist) because i was watching her drama dali and the cocky prince so thats why.
Eun yoo and eun hyuk both have different personalities despite they are siblings but they both are amazing and i really didnt liked him at start, everyone was suffuring buy hyunsu suffered a lot thats why he was the stromgest of them all and really will really appreciate if he will survive in season 2 also as i cant se him dying already.
I really dont know how i did that but in between of this intense thriller drama i had a new crush on song kang and hyuk both .

Gets better
This was one of those dramas that gets better and yep, by the last few episodes I was getting really into it and I loved the direction that the plot took.

It did, however, take a while for me to reach that point; I kind of wish the earlier episodes had played into the plot more instead of just feeling like story set-up. without really answering or asking any big questions.

I also really loved a few of the characters — namely Hyun-su — but the cast was just a tad too big and I really didn't care much for many of the characters until the latter few episodes.

Even if you’re into RomComs, watch episode 1 and you will want to continue.
I’m not a person to write reviews but the way Sweet Home had an impact is insane.
The Story line was amazing, from the very first scene to the very last one. It was well distributed between suspense, thriller, horror (for me), trust and friendship. I didn’t think it’d be that good but finally gave it a try last night and poof- in 12 hours I’m done watching this show.
The cast SHOOK me. I didn’t think Song Kang would portray his character so well. Another character that shook me was ji-su. (the nam ju ur girl from it’s ok to not be ok) I found her character extremely annoying in IOTNBO but here- dang this girl was rocking it. Each and every cast member fitted their role perfectly.
The music was good as we were familiar with a few songs and I liked how it matched the scenes.
I gave Re-Watch an 8 cause I’ll rewatch it when I wish to bawl my eyes out.
Overall: Exceeded my expectations. I really didn’t expect it to be this good and I’m so impressed. This DEFINITELY has potential for season 2 and I’ll cry if there’s no season 2 cause PLEASE! I’m kinda scared cause Netflix is kinda famous for AMAZING season 1 but kinda shitty season 2 with unnecessary plot twists. Hopefully it won’t be the case here and they announce a season 2!

Sweet home is a good (considered the best for me) drama to watch during the pandemic
This is my first time writing a review!

I'm still pretty much a newbie to kdrama industry but i do watched couple of zombies/vampires/monsters/devils/mythical creatures/horror dramas, so i was very surprised by how realistic and was in awe of many high quality cgi scenes from this drama. I was immediately captivated by the trailer of sweet home and i knew that this drama will be great.

""apocalyptic horror South Korean television series"", can't completely explain how amazing this drama is. Although this drama is categorized as horror, i think it is not as horrifying as Conjuring series. HOWEVER, this drama makes me panic every minute. I think one of the greatest strength of this drama and makes it attractive is... You totally don't know what's going to happen. You can't predict what will happen in the next episode AT ALL. Any moment someone could die, any moment i will cry. (Did i mentioned that this drama makes me emotional too?) So basically, unlike many other zombie dramas such as KINGDOM or TRAIN TO BUSAN, you really can't tell what the story will turn out in the end, ecspecially when this drama is about humans turning into ""monsters"" when they got overcame by their own ""desires"". (as complicated as it sounds, you can watch the drama and find out!)

A TOTALLY NEW CONCEPT for a kdrama, unlike zombies, you turn into one when u got bitten (infection) or maybe angels and devils or demons, you turn into one when u drank their blood (?). Literally, this drama gives panic attacks to audience because it gives no warning on how or WHEN the characters is infected and is becoming their evil side.

Now that we talk about the monstrous sides of ""humans"" that this drama managed to capture perfectly, let's talk about the distinct characteristics or appearance of EVERY ""monsters"" the main character, Cha Hyun-soo encounters. Spoiler: For example, a disabled runner that wishes to run again, would give into his desires to become this hideous monster with legs that can run so fast that no one can escape from/see.

Ok, if you came this far. Im sure it is getting boring but i have so much to share with you! The concept and storyline of the drama is already very well-written, but the casting and acting in this drama makes it so much better. Song Kang acts as Cha hyun soo, a male that finds life meaningless and been counting days to mark his death. You can easily tell depression symptoms from the way he carry himself or just leaching off at his room/at rooftop. He is a character that is broken inside and talks little. But we could understand enough about his struggle based on his behaviours and his past (NOPE A SPOLIER! AND WILL MAKE U ANGRY AND CRY AT THE SAME TIME) I really liked how instead of a very brave, aggresively justice or highly intelligent main character that highlights a lot of survival movies, this drama chose a main character we can relate to. Cha hyun soo thinks little of himself, doubts himself alot which sometimes restricts him into action immediately under dangerous stituations. He has very low self esteems but is a very kind hearted fellow. He is stupidly too kind for this world ugh And there is this one scenario that highlights how other characters make use of his good heart to stay alive. The main character transformed into ""desire"" halfly and can regenerate his body when he is injured BUT HE STILL FEEL PAIN. Humans being humans, others that are still ""humans"" forced Hyun Soo to travel to dangerous areas where monsters roam to help forage for food. *i dont know what im talking about this point, you get me if you watched it :D*

The camerawork is smooth and doesn't make me feel choked. The sequence when Hyun soo have to fight for himself and others also were captured nicely. Hyun soo is just a person and never fought against 8 feet of a monster before. So the struggling and actually tripping or panicking during the fights really are good details. (He almost died alot of times omg) And i think the music is pretty iconic too, u can hear the ending song and damn it stucks on your mind. The music really just makes you think ""oh thats sweet home"" ORIGINALITY YAS

Hmm OH YES, You know there are many dramas that sometimes over-summarize side characters personality and it is not easy to protray side characters importance and presence throughout the entire drama. This drama did a good job in showing side characters desires to survive and realistic sides that anyone under the same stituation could relate too. No sugarcoating yay and omg look at how diverse the remaining survivors are (there are mothers that lost their child, children that lost their dad, gangsters that are retired but damn soft inside,teenagers that are overly positive and depressed, a firefighter that lost her fiance, a girl that is too rebelious, a typical kdrama auntie, and more). I ended up falling in love with all the *important* characters BECAUSE of their flaws and their humane qualities (such as comforting someone that is down or forgiving or sympathize or setting up a funeral although the whole chaos is still going on)
And the fact that the characters are so heavily outnumbered but hope really kept each other going.

Ok..the end must come. And i just want to say that hyun soo is gorgeous and handsome. Im running out of ideas, please just watch it. I am hungry and can't think any gorgeous words to describe this drama. I shall eat now :3 sayonara


COnclusion: watch it :]

For horror fans, this is a cheesy, campy, low budget cgi, action horror, and not a serious show.
This what happens when you don't have good enough budget on cgi and your director's experience is only rom com shows. So, the only option is a cheesy and campy show like shark nado, zombie nation, or any show on syfy channel. Therefore, the show should not be judge as a serious horror. Ep 1 establishes the cheesy tone when they play warrior's music in background and Lee Eun Hyuk is spraying fire hydrant in monster face. It's a joke and this why they play it in every time heoric moment happens.

Most of the characters are stale and common tropes, which is the main issue with the show and not a failure adaptation of the character relationships. Like, who cares if the show fail to adapt character relationships, when your main character Cha Hyun Soo has the most overused backstory with family dead, bullied in school, and same boring personality. This isn't even spoilers because this literally every main Asian boy orign story. It's raining and there's either sad piano or violin playing in background and someone they care about dies. At this point, I am starting to think all of the boys in Asia real life are bullied and their families are dead. Furthermore, you got Captain smarty pants, Wannabe gangster dude, Sword dude, Healer girl, etc. Imagine Cha Hyun Soo had a normal personality and his family was alive that would be the real horror.

However, there was a couple characters that were entertaining and what kept me continuing to watch. Han Du Sik made interesting combat weapons and traps with house supplies, occasionally joke around like about his disability, and he is decent actor. Ahn Gil Seop is not your typical grandpa character, who are usually nice, weak, wise, and formal. He is kickass grandpa, had a dark sense of humor, and jokes about his death a lot. They are the main reason why this show was decent to watch.

This Caused Emotional Damage
Everything... was so good. The ending was definitely the best part I think because it was absolutely insane. To me, the first few episodes were kind of confusing and I didn't really understand what was happening, but I think it was made to be that way because they probably wanted the characters to be mysterious in the beginning so they could tell us all of their backstories near the end and hit us with a wave of emotion. Well, good choice. Also, the plotline of this so is VERY unexpected, it talks about bullying, suicide, etc, so it's really a mix of all that, gore, thriller, monsters, and character development of absolutely amazing characters who deserve to be worshipped. The last few episodes went kind of fast, especially some parts I thought they should've lingered on more, but it's still one of the best dramas I've watched. And the plot is so good I can't even describe it.
The characters and actors/actresses were absolutely INCREDIBLE. The way they acted their characters out SO well is amazing. The love I have for some of these characters and the emotion I feel for them shows that the actors and actresses did a phenomenal job and they were a great pick for the role. My favourite characters are Hyunsu, Jaeheon, Yikyung, and Eunhyuk. And wait, we can't EVER forget one of my favourite actors, Kim Sungcheol. I NEVER knew he had this side of him when he played Eui Myeong. *Shakes head* he's absolutely insane, his acting skills are just simply so good. He can act the sweet guy like in 'Our Beloved Summer' or he can play the... wait, no spoilers, whatever character he plays in here lol. I also just watched this because of Song Kang, and thank goodness I watched it because it's definitely one of my favourite shows ever. And I mostly watch romance dramas and I've never watched something like this so it's odd that it's one of my favourites now. That shows how good it is!
Overall, it was amazing and I would recommend this to absolutely anyone.

LOVED IT, but i understand it may have some flaws...
Ok so the central story and format of this story isn't particularly unique or never seen before, and its gorey, and sometimes the cgi is a teeny weensy flop, (but only sometimes, and the actors make up for all of that ASTRONOMICALLY), and the selection of imagine dragons WARRIORS was a little questionnable, (and broke immersion for me sometimes LOL) BUT

BUT.

All of those are just nitpicks because this show is, wow, it was a savior for me when i was starved for a GOOD kdrama to watch this season.

And my gosh, netflix sure makes some flop kdramas but this was not one of them thats for sure.

hearts for Lee Do Hyun, he was a scene-stealer for this show, and thats on period. ?‍♀️♥︎♥︎♥︎
Anyways lemme make this more comprehensive for people who can't read brain vomit.

PROS

1. The cast
fuck the cast was very good. i haven't read the full webtoon, and to my knowledge lee si young's character was never a part of the story, but I don't mind her addition. I love the minor changes they made with each character, eg. sang wook (played by lee jin wook) was slightly less of a meathead/is much more grim (at least from what i've seen in the first 5 episodes of the webtoon). Same thing with lee eun hyuk (played by lee do hyun), the director specifically told him to be more serious and smile less, from what I've heard. and it works. with the kind of things eun hyuk has done, if he did it smiling it would seem.....i dont know, the fact that he always has such a grim and cold face tells me more that he is trying his best to restrain himself and sacrifice emotional thought, for the benefit of everyone in the group. but many fans still think he's selfish, but this isn't my manifesto on why you shouldn't hate on eun hyuk LOL

2. The themes/story
honestly what more is there to say than, this is a story of human relationships and human conncections, and all of the spheres and....sadly, the repercussions of it when u have evil people involved :( it tackles grim themes, but doesnt really force feed you, or take a moral highground/responsibility with it. I like that.

3. Production quality
idk much abt cinematography, but the fact that I don't have a single complaint should be testament enough. this was a high quality production crew, both int terms of the makeup, set design, and cinematography, I'm impressed. ofc some scenes can seem a little less good in comparison, but the key word is comparison. everything was kept to a high quality.

CONS
1. HeRe WE Aare DOnT TurN AWyA NOW
I didn't like use of imagine dragons. it could because im an English native and it was jarring , or that whenever i heard english in a korean drama where im specifically wanting to hear korean audio, the switch of language kinda jolts me. Nothing against iamgine dragons? but maybe they could have used more epic music

2. CLIFFHANGER
the season ended on a cliffhanger. honestly not sure if there will be a second season.

3. ADAPTATION CONTEXT?
I never read the full webtoon. i only read about the first 7 chapters at MOST. According to people who have read the full webtoon, as an adaptation, this series falls short. they destroyed many of the relationships with the characters, and I did catch on at some point that they tried to make all the characters a lot more grim and ?, and that could potentially be chopping out some fuzzier dynamics. but it's netflix, the same company that wanted to add blood and sex to avatar, a beloved children's show, im honestly not surprised with the change here. It's unfortunate, but I guess we'll just have to read the webtoon if we want to see hyuk and hyun being friends.

HOWEVER

as someone who didn't have that webtoon to be comparing the show to, if you look at this as a standalone, it's a good drama. Its not some STELLAR, INFALLIBLE SHOW, (and which show is?) but it's not awful either, and it measures above the rest. I'm biased of course, but, it all depends on your outlook if you'll love this, or hate it.

ANYWAYS, this was a lot of typing.

TL;DR: GIVE THIS SHOW A WATCH, AND YOU WONT REGRET IT! the horror never gets TOO scary, I watched this at 3am in total darkness by myself and yes, i was scared, but i wasn't shitting bricks??? so there's that :3

also lee do hyun is here what reason do u have NOT TO. kmt

Sweet Home
Much anticipated series, although i had not read the webtoon itself. The star-studded cast was enough to draw me in. The plot itself was straightforward: humans turned monsters. However, i think the story itself really make us wonder what draws the boundaries between good and evil, human and monsters. We are shown that human itself can be more barbaric than ""monsters"" when thrown into dire situations while beings we deem as ""monsters"" can be more humane that the humans we define ourselves.

The story itself was tight at the start, and was paced just right, right til the end. The acting was stellar, with excellent cinematographic and special effects. While it started as a thriller, it ended up being more action & suspense at the back. We are shown human relationships and the choices they make in face of extreme conditions. I find the characters interesting and some of the choices they make noble. I mean, let's be true to ourselves, we may not be able to make the same decision if we are given the same state. It reminds me of a mixture of Stranger Things & Money Heist, which i absolutely enjoyed. While we are shown the dark side of humans, we also see that humans itself are beautiful creatures. I was especially touched with the characters whom sacrificed themselves, for fellow humans whom they had no blood relations to! The romance aspect was minimal but warm enough and touching to see, especially for Jaeheon & Jisoo and Sangwook & Yoori, though both couples didn't make it in the end.

At the end, i am convinced a season 2 will happen. There are so many questions left unanswered. If this wasn't a disease, what was the cause of this ""infection""? Why is Hyunsoo immune? How did Sangwook managed to rescue Hyunsoo at the end? And is Eunhyeok even alive? (I mean why did he have to leave behind?) What happens after Yikyeong joins the military?

All in i all, i believe it's a good watch and probably because i am biased over such genres. I can't wait for season 2 to happen already :)

This is one of the best Korean webtoon adaption amazing cinematography and acting I'm trying to be as honest as i can be. Is is this the best drama of 2020 ? no but definitely in top 10 or 15 its worth watching it believe me i don't know for sure how many have read the webtoon ? But i did not read it all and that's why i think i could enjoy it more with out any high exception. The special effects and CGI were amazing and its shows how far South Korea has come in the movie industry my advice for everyone watch it with a laid back vibe don't think to deep in it or to big just enjoy it as it is. Last but not least i want to sincerely think the actors, director screen writer and all of the crew for their amazing and hard work.

Elaborate and Intricate
My favorite characters in this series were Jung Jae Heon (Kim Nam Hee) with his samurai sword, Han Du Sik (Kim Sang-Ho) with his makeshift crutch gun, Cha Hyun Soo (Song Kang) with his electric spear/knife sort of thingy, and Pyeon Sang Wook (Lee Jin Wook) with his sheer anger and power. I love the creativity, innovation, and detail put in the storytelling, the characters, and the monsters alike. The monsters are not only elaborately done but quite intricately. It's almost like they mirrored each character's fear and apprehension. And in that sense, I liked that all the characters were flawed, each fighting not only literal monsters but the monster within, scars of life, scars if left to fester could turn them into the very monsters they fight in all its forms, be it the fear of loneliness, biases, anger, selfishness, grief, loss, injustice, prejudice, and everything else in between.

They say, sometimes human places create inhuman monsters. That's so true in that each of the characters starts out trying to survive the best way they know how individually, even if it meant using others for their own benefit or furthering their own survival. Still, along the way and in their fight to survive, they come to realize that they as humans are capable of the worst things possible and that they weren't just trying to survive but fighting for the survival of humanity, to not turn into the very monsters they were trying to survive. As said, it’s not the strongest or the most intelligent who survive but those who can best manage change. I truly enjoyed this show and the accompanying OST; very well done.

Character-wise:
Lee Shi Young was exceptional in her role, but that's nothing new as she’s always great at whatever role she plays, but I have to say I was very impressed by how fit she looked as Seo Yi Kyung, the firefighter fighting her own demons. There were quite a few hard to stomach characters; Lee Eun Yoo (Go Min Shi) and Eun Hyuk (Lee Do Hyun) were among those. The two of them were the most selfish, each for their own struggles but at the same time, were the ones with the most character development, in my opinion. However, I must note Eun Hyuk embodied the leader role very well towards the end; seeing that development in him made me realize he was so selfish but more pragmatic in his bid to protect their only shelter from the dire world outside.

The most inspiring character was Jung Jae Heon both for his grounded belief in what's right but also for his courage and conviction in not once wavering between what was right vs. what was wrong. In a way, Sang Wook was a mirror of Jae Heon in his determination paid or otherwise to brutally dispensing justice. The two characters that brought the most depth to the series other than Sang-Ho were Kim Gab Soo as Ahn Gil Seop and Go Yoon Jung as Park Yu Ri Gil Seop's caregiver. Indeed a great source of inspiration and motivation to the struggle. On the other hand, Sang Ho's character was the most profound, not just for the powers he amassed from being infected but also for breaking the chains and labels society consciously and sometimes unconsciously puts on everything and every one different out of fear or ignorance. He was the doorway to the true examination of human monstrosity and humanity's embodiment from a monsters' perspective.

Chant: SEASON 2!
Just finished watching and I am amazed at how well put this was! All I can say is that you will not be disappointed and that I will be highly disappointed if a season 2 is not made with the same actors and actresses! It’s that good! I OST made it even better. I don’t want to give too much away as this is a drama that is really worth the watch! From the first episode to the very last (10 was not enough), kept me on my toes. It’s different in a good way and shows the grit of a possible situation that makes the list of anything can happen in 2020.

Wow. Um. This show is a lot to handle. Both visually and emotionally. It starts off strong and I think it even gets better as it goes along, though there were parts that got a bit muddled towards the end. This show is very stressful to watch, but is certainly worth watching, especially if you’re a fan of zombie/survivor type shows. It is super violent and hits about every trigger warning (suicide, self harm, bullying, etc.), so be warned. The biggest strength of the show is its well written and compelling characters and their relationships. The show does an excellent job of developing these characters amidst all of the action. Though I actually did appreciated that this show didn’t go too in depth with the psychological aspect. There was nuance to the characters, but it didn’t feel like the show was trying to impart any deep messages. I think that works well for a show like this that has so much plot to cover. But it still managed to sneak in quite a lot of character development without you even noticing. It’s really well written, and the characters are a diverse group. Their situations in life, their baggage, their attitude towards the monsters and each other are all different. It’s also great to see how people’s opinions about the monsters change over time. I enjoyed the monsters too. They’re quite creative, and finding out about them is interesting since you have no frame of reference. A complaint I have is that there are still quite a few things that are unclear, which is certainly intentional in some places, but I think the rules may have applied a bit inconsistently so I wasn’t 100% certain about how to kill them, etc. I think the show could have used a few more episodes to explain a few things, and a few of the character/relationship development felt like it skipped forward a bit, but that was likely due to lack of time. Oh, and the music occasionally didn’t feel like it fit the scene, so I had to dock some points there.

Don’t expect everyone to survive, do expect to be emotionally devastated when they die, and good luck surviving the end of episode 8.

HOLY SH*TTTTT JUST WATCH IT
I did not expect this... I didn`t read the webtoon nor read any plot stuff, soI didn`t know what to expect! However, I surely did not expect this, it`s a wonderful show. Let me be honest, I sobbed like a baby every time someone died. It was so enjoyable and the ending was also unexpected. I did not know who to trust and who to not, and I thought everyone was fishy. Then, they became fine and then boom! Moreover, the supposedly normal ones are NOT TO BE trusted. Not gonna lie, I didn`t understand the last few moments, or more like I was mind-blown. That`s why I need season 2!!!!!!!

Sweet Home More Like Sad Home!!!
Let me start off by saying that after watching episode 1 and seeing the CGI/animation and how well to say the least underwhelming it was I thought ""Eh I may pass on this one."" But I gave episode 2 a watch and you know the CGI/animation of the monsters is easily overlookable given that the story is THAT good. I will say though it took me the entirety of the first two episodes to get used to and not shrivel up at the amount of blood that spewed out during their nosebleeds and I'm not usually one to bat an eye at a bloody scene. I also must note that I did not read the webtoon before watching this so this review is solely based off the drama.

Make sure you have the tissues everyone, oh and try not to get too attached to well most of the characters because...spoiler earlier...a lot of good people die in it.

Let's start with the Cast, oh my god, each and every one of them were amazing. But we'll talk mostly about the main characters (and not just the ones listed as main's on here because I truly felt there were a lot of main characters in this story.)

Cha Hyun Soo, we literally got to see him grow from being the shy teenager we first seen. Granted he wasn't originally shy, bullying having to do a lot with his more reserved and standoffish self. He became my little baby in this, I hated whenever people looked at him as a monster whenever he was the least monster-like of them all. The only other thing I've seen Song Kang in is Love Alarm, so I couldn't quite tell exactly how he was going to be in a more action-y drama, but he pulled it off well!

Seo Yi Kyung, at first I really liked her. She seemed to have her life together and didn't mind risking her own life for others. Well, after she left to go find the tablet of her deceased (I mean he's either a monster or something like Hyun Soo, we still don't know yet) soon-to-be husband and gets caught by the military she comes back and she starts sketching me out. At first I thought for sure she'd be the one to ruin it for everyone, and don't get me wrong she has a baby to protect but that entire situation of ""Do I turn Hyun Soo to be a test subject to save the majority or do I just not do anything and risk more people dying?"" Is one that really doesn't have a right answer. I'm glad she was not the one to do it and ended up becoming the Leader of sorts near the end. Lee Shi Young did a wonderful of portraying her, as she always does well.

Pyeon Sang Wook, I truly think he grew the most as a character, or well maybe not the most as I think he was that person all along. He just needed someone to tell him it was okay to be that. I loved him. And I was at first pleasantly surprised by the ending of him with Hyunsoo but I quickly realized that it is probably Ui Myeong and not him. The scene with Yuri though, it broke my heart. Lee Jin Wook did amazing as usual, I will say I like him better in this than in Voice 2.

Lee Eun Hyuk, I honestly did not go into this show thinking I'd dislike a character played by Lee Do Hyun, I was wrong. He was so selfish in the beginning but by the end became a better person and I am so happy for that. Although, it broke my heart to see him stay behind to ""stop"" Hyun Soo. I hope we get to see him in a second season, but...

Yoon Ji Soo, I loved her as a duo with Jaeheon, they leveled each other out so well. She didn't get as much character development as the other listed mains. I feel though that she will grow more in a second season. I see her taking on the leadership role. Park Gyu Young as a hippie/take no shit character though, I loved it!

Lee Eun Yoo, oh did I hate her at first. She was so bitchy but I mean I level with her, her brother was kind of an asshole at the beginning so...Her bitchiness was her way of hiding that she cared. She grew a lot as a character and by the end I loved her character. Go Min Shi was amazing per usual.

We'll do a rapid fire of the next few because I felt they deserved the Main Character title as well. Jung Jaeheon, I mean he did the ultimate sacrifice. Who didn't love him? Ahn Gil Seop, I feel like his character was robbed, we didn't even really get to see his reaction to Yuri's death. And he bled from the nose once but nothing else occurred to him? I was under the impression he was turning but then he never showed any more signs so I thought maybe not and then he just died, which I think was going to happen anyways but it felt a tad bit rushed. Park Yu Ri, she was pretty self-less, such a good character and god it pissed me off when Ui Myeong did what he did. Han Du Sik, such a lovable old man and he too, like Jaeheon, did the ultimate sacrifice. Lastly Ui Myeong, boy was crazy, I went back and forth on whether I liked him or not and yeah...I don't obviously but I will say his monster power has to be the freaking coolest.

Story:
It's pretty straightforward and gory but amazing! Are the real monsters the humans? We see them constantly at each other's throats in the beginning, later using Hyun Soo as their own personal bitch, forcing him to run and get supplies in the upper floors while simultaneously getting his ass handed to him each time he goes. They look at him like a monster whenever they are the real monsters. The turning isn't an illness, a virus or something curable. It's due to desire? It makes since in a few of the monster's cases, Myung Sook becomes a baby, which is exactly what she desired. Du Sik's feet transformed and he could walk again, he desired to walk again. But um...what exactly did Ui Myeong desire to be able to use his blood the way he does. What does Hyun Soo really desire when he gains the wings/blades on his arm? What does the giant in the one episode desire? The reoccurring tongue-monster from the first half? I felt that should've been explained more but again they are banking on a second season so hopefully all will be explained then.

Music:
It was not overdone like in typically k-dramas but I did have to laugh whenever that Imagine Dragons song plays during some scenes. It was fitting yes but also funny.

Rewatch Value:
100% I'd watch it again. I'm hoping for another season soon!

Overall Rating:
10/10
If you can get past the video-game like animation you're in for a great drama!

Advertises itself to be about monsters taking over an apartment complex, but is much more
This review is solely based on the drama adaptation, as I have not read the web-toon and therefore, will not comment on it.

Netflix's 10-episode Korean drama series in 2020 have truly been greatness after greatness, and Sweet Home does not fall flat on this.

Sweet Home is able to engage and emotionally withhold audiences by using the concept of 'monsters' as a metaphor for humans owns desires, and does it in a direct and sufficient way.

- STORY -

The story is fast-paced, due to having 10 episodes to basically in-take the entire storyline (with the hints of maybe a second season). Luckily, the writer is able to give a brief explanation on how these monsters came to be in the first two-three episodes, which is explained through the smart and well-written characters. As the writer does not explain everything, it leaves the audience engaged and interested in how to prevent these monsters from 'forming', and in need to see the characters they've developed emotional connections towards, succeed. The story does not have plot-holes, and is able to develop in a fast manner that is captivating and engaging for the audience.

While having 'horror' themes, the drama is not entirely scary, but rather wants you to focus on the main story and the metaphorical concept of ones desires, and how much they can take over oneself. There is no real romance themes, but is able to give hints of 'romance' through small gestures and spoken words between each character, that engages audiences who may only be interested in romance, into a story that isn't all about romance.

'Sweet Home' is able to make the audience question who deserves to live in these life-threatening situations, and how far people are willing to go in order to live their life, despite their brutal pasts.

- CHARACTERS -

The show sold me with not necessarily the story but, the characters. With only 10 episodes to break down the many characters introduced to us in a very short period of time, the writer is able to quickly but effectively reflect on the different personalities of the characters, as well as their history as each episode progresses. The characters (for the most part), think and act like their age, but do not do it in a typical 'horror' genre way. Most of the characters act smart, but with different ways of 'acting' on the monsters that perfectly reflect their ages, gender and values. All the characters are written to be faulted, not necessarily morally perfect, which aids audiences into the question of wether or not these individuals deserve to survive the monster infestation.

If you are someone, like myself, that becomes invested and emotionally connected to well-written characters, Sweet Home is a web-toon adaptation that is able to strongly invest time into its characters, and develop a hope for survival for each of them, despite their traumatic past.

- CONCLUSION -

Despite its flaws, such as the unusual choice of soundtrack in some action scenes, Sweet Home is able to connect each characters emotional past to both their desires, and the monsters that lurk around the apartment complex.

Sweet Home is a must-watch if you are someone who cares for well-written and realistic characters that, thankfully, do not play stupid in a monster infestation.

Just don't desire too much...
'Sweet Home' truly exceeded all my expectations. I did not read the webtoon so I will not address any plot differences between both versions.

I already knew Song Kang was a great actor but he still surprised me a lot in this show. I really liked his character even though he was sometimes too dull and absent-minded for my liking, but obviously he was like that for a reason.

Lee Do Hyun was definitely my second favorite character, as he was very mysterious in the first half and even kind of dislikeable (I never did), but the turn he had in the second half and how so many things about his personality were clarified really added a ton on the type of character that he was.

I don't want to get into much detail because I don't want to tag this review as a spoiler, but I really loved every character. I think all of them had a clear role in the survival hope; even if some characters were clearly dumb and annoying, even those were properly built even if they didn't have such a strong background (some none at all). Every evil character was absolutely crazy, the ""good"" characters all knew their places and stick to them well.

I have a major complaint on the CGI for the monsters as I believe the production of the series was very carefully done and the cinematography was of the absolute most artistic style for this concept, but I feel like they invested too much on the settings and cinematics (and cast) that they forgot or ran short to invest on a better CGI. Still, even if it's ridiculously bad you get used to it after a few eps.

I loved the whole concept of the monsters and their transformation always blew my mind. It just kind of stresses me because I really don't see how they can overcome this in the next season(s) if there will be any, but I'm anticipating more of this show in the near future, hopefully.

The cast was amazing, I really loved Song Kang and Lee Do Hyun's dynamics on their characters, as well as how they complement all together with the rest of the cast. I'm just a little dissatisfied with Lee Jin Wook's character, since it was very promising but after his arc developed I think he lost that unbreakable and powerful aura they gave him.

Anyway, 'Sweet Home' is absolutely a must-watch and if anyone reading this is concerned on whether or not this would be too horror-y and scary for you, don't think so anymore! I'm a real coward when it comes to horror and stuff but this one was nothing like that so you're safe to watch it!

MUST! WATCH!
Oh! my! god! This was a drama I took my sweet time watching because I didn't want it to end. Personally I have not read the WEBTOON as I was very impatient and I was honestly looking forward to this one so whether it was a good adaptation is up to the readers of the webtoon and I am simply writing this as someone who has watched a lot of shows and dramas.
Not once did I think about dropping it. Horror isn't my thing but not watching this was OUT OF THE QUESTION. As someone who gets bored and tired easily, this wasn't the case with this drama. It constantly kept me on my toes, interested to see what will happen next. So much that this became a problem as I like to watch dramas late at night, but it was too late for me to watch the next episode as much as I wanted to.
The cast was incredible, I loved their acting and I feel like they perfectly fit their roles. The characters had a certain dynamic between them that kept them together during the show, we got to see the bonds that were formed between them and I thought this was incredible. I was a huge fan of the music choices as well, especially the OST (shoutout to bewhy for that!)

the one thing I didn't exactly like was the monsters, especially on the second episode, they could be a lot better but this was more of a budget issue and it did not affect how much I enjoyed the drama. Other than that, this drama is a big YES for me.

Late runner wins my favourite drama of the year
Wow, just wow. If I don't get a second season, I'm going to become a monster.
Let me start by saying, I hate horror, I avoid it like the plague but after watching the trailer, I decided to sit down and watch some of it, and it hooked me from the start. I have never read the webtoon, so I went into this blind.
The only thing that has a shrug from me: the song Warriors being played. Only thing that irritated me.
The acting superb, two thumbs up for the cast. They had me in a whirlwind emotion of hate, hope, love, among other things.
This drama's manifestation of monster's, both physically and psychologically was brilliant. What added to my delight, was the monsters appearance, almost webtoony in a way. They weren't made to blend in perfectly with their environment, they were made to look unreal, and that only heightened the idea of real monsters. Human's and their shortcomings. When we cut to people, it was gritty, and real, and dirty. The metaphorical beauty of this drama hit me like a bus (or a firetruck).
Another point is the characters themselves. Morally grey. I love when this is done right, and this was done awesome. I had my favourites, and I had those I loathed, and there were those who changed my mind. I grew with the characters, and loved every minute of it. And what brought more meaning was character deaths. They did this so right. They were poignant, and made me stop and think. I didn't just go, oh well, another dead, I actually paused and grieved when a few of my favourites died (or did they?) They had different personalities, different goals, different histories, we didn't dwell on them, but were exposed to them fresh, raw and wholly, which kept the teetering pace.
I think 10 episodes was a great package. I feel like some drama's do 16-20 and they end up with so much filler, or flashback or things that meant nothing. Here, everything was inserted for a reason.
And that ending episode, the twists? Damn, that's an ending done right.
Can I also say the poetry behind Hyun-Su's form? He looked like an avenging angel, and whether he caused that eclipse or not, I can't wait to see them delve further into this world of survival.
Sweet home hit a sweet spot, in a year of drama misses for me, and I eagerly await the next season! Fighting team!

beautiful insanity
I'll start this by making clear that i have not read the original webtoon so I'm writing with just the drama in consideration.

First of all this is definitely not for everyone. a lot of death, violence, gore and mentions of triggering things that even i, as someone who doesn't really get affected by these knowing it's fiction, had to take small breaks or look away. i guess what you'd expect from a horror, action focused drama.

Even so, this drama was so interesting and attention-grabbing i couldn't stop watching. The story is incredible and somehow, especially now with the pandemic and everything, felt real. Every single major (if not almost every) character is well written with intriguing back stories that reflect on their motives and behaviour and very easy to sympathize and get attached to. The way they interact with eachother feels realistic and the relationships built between them are natural. There's also big diversity in characters for everyone, even the characters that are written to be disliked in a way can be understood. The actors did an amazing job delivering the emotions of the characters and bringing every scene to life, which is exactly why you most likely won't survive watching this without balling your eyes out.

Suprisingly, unlike most kdramas, the comedic breaks are minimum which keeps you on your toes throughout the whole show and even when there are such breaks it doesn't fell like filler but rather an easier way to get to know the characters and their dynamics better.
The special effects and cgi were decent and looked mostly realistic and the camera work and setting gave a chilling and classic korean horror vibe. The ending also lives a big opening for a season 2 which I'm really hoping for.

All in all, this is a beautiful and heart tugging story of seeing tragic but powerful characters trying to survive and go through hardship after hardship yet still continue to fight, stay hopeful and not give up. Definitely a good watch.

Fun and heartwarming with a side of fear
Sweet Home was fantastic fun. It is what it says it is. It's not masquerading as a sappy romance. There's not forced relationship in the middle of people fighting for their lives. People come together to survive a monster apocalypse, if you will, and that's it. It shows the humane and nasty sides of humans. I say that because if you're a person that needs a side of romance in EVERYTHING, this is not your cupper. Yes, as humans the characters get closer, but it's not that type of party.

The story is about surviving a national emergency where monsters are the new norm and anyone can turn. The surviving tenants of the Sweet Home apartment complex try to make a good thing out of bad while fighting monsters (within and without) and trying to figure out how to survive. Of course there is the requisite food rationing, power grabs, and in fighting, but mostly the residents support each other in their survival as they don't know who has or may turn into a monster. There is so much more I'd love to say, but I think it'll just be one giant spoiler. I will say I disagree with the reviews that say it's more than a monster series/drama. The best monster movies (and series) have all shown the beautiful and ugly sides of humanity. That's what they're all about. How do you come together to survive and outlast adversity? That's how TWD has stayed on for so long.

I have got to say the effects are great! They're all CG, but done very well. They're on par with movie effects. The writing and directing are good. The cast is wonderful! I was shocked to see Kim Gab Soo in this genre. I can't recall ever seeing him out of a suit. The scene stealing rounds out with 2 of my other favorites: Woo Hyun and Kim Sang Ho. I'd like to say it was a great ensemble, but the leads were prevalent. There was a lead ensemble and a support ensemble that worked well together if that makes any sense. Kang Sang was wonderful as Hyun Soo. He brought so much heart to his role. Lee Jin Wook, who I barely recognized due to his weight, was perfection. His character grows by leaps and bounds. This was the first time I've ever liked Lee Shi Young in anything! She finally found her niche and a good use for those boxing skills.

The music was good. It worked well in every episode. I've already started re-watching it soooo...yeah it's worth it, especially if, like me, you watch series from other nations in English with subs (when available) and in original language with subs.

To me Sweet Home put all the best things in a monster movie into a drama. It brought the heart and sadness. It brought the violence and fear. Mostly, it brings the hope. My hope is for season 2. :D

A wild gory ride
I binged this kdrama in a day and ohhhh boy was it worth it, a lot of people were excited the webtoon was being adapted into a drama, and I have to say, it’s the best action-horror I’ve seen this year.

The monsters were done surprisingly well. I would’ve preferred practical effects, but the CGI wasn’t terrible, they were convincing enough to give out those creepy / gory vibes, so that was a plus.

The acting performances were spot on, giving a shout out to Song Kang (he’s actually the reason I started watching lol) because his acting was fire in this show.

The plot is anything but cliché, the characters and actions of those characters made it interesting, AND we got some great background stories, you can find more about character backgrounds in the webtoon. What made this show great was the ending didn’t feel the slightest bit anti-climatic, like many other kdrama endings I’ve seen this year. The end gives you enough info or enough closure for you to be sufficiently satisfied, with a good chunk of the characters, best part? All of the webtoon wasn’t adapted in this one season we got, SO, that leaves room for our unanswered questions, to be answered in s2 (if any).

The pacing of this show I’ll commend as well, I find kdrama pacing can lack sometimes, as in: odd-cuts or no purpose filler episodes, but none of that happened in this drama. Not once. Every scene had a purpose in plot and character, and that’s another reason why this one is a winner.

Now for the things that bugged me ...

The atmosphere, really felt more like an action-zombie series instead of a horror-thriller,if that makes sense, even though it’s labeled horror-thriller lol that’s a lie, it had a “zombie apocalypse” feel more than anything, which isn’t ... bad, someone mentioned in the comments feed Studio Dragon should’ve hired the people who did The Guest, I strongly agree with this, I think atmospherically they would’ve done a better job in setting a darker-mature tone to this drama, which the webtoon most definitely had.

The soundtrack wasn’t spectacular, as a horror fan I find most horror shows don’t have solid soundtracks to begin with, but hearing Warriors by Imagine Dragons every time a character decided to grow a pair, got old real quick lol, also I didn’t think the song fit the vibe of the show, nor did the music overall, but that’s imo, so take it with a grain of salt :)

As for character deaths, I think some of them were unnecessary, like Han Du Sik’s, he was actually one of my favorite characters, and his death could’ve been better imo, as for Jae Heon even though he went out like a badass, I felt he deserved to live, the man was a fighter till the end.

The cliffhanger, *sigh* ... kdrama writers do this thing where they set the plot in motion, give us a cliffhanger, but we have no idea if there’s going to be a second season, so technically this show could end right at 10 episodes, and we’d be stuck with an unnecessary incomplete ending, I know the show is adapted from a webtoon, doesn’t mean it doesn’t bug the sh*t outta me ... especially when kdramas don’t normally have second seasons to begin with, normally there’s one season with 16, 20, or 32 ep’s and that’s all we get. This happened with Vagabond where the end was foreshadowed at the beginning of the show, but it was still left incomplete for us to assume what happened to all the characters. I’m prayinggggg this show gets renewed for another season by Netflix. PRAYING. The final episode was kick ass, and initially we found out Sang Wook (aka gangster dude) has been hidinggggg some important stuff lol, as in what tf does he want with Hyun Soo, the biggest WTF moment for sure, Yi Kyung is off on her own now and the rest of the group is faced with an unforeseen future, good characters died, and the stakes are higher than ever. What will happen to Hyun Soo? Will he be experimented on like the rest of his kind? Will he find a way to overcome his inner monster? What was in the suitcase? How many others are there like Hyun Soo? Will there’s of the group survive? Only the webtoon can tell us, as for this drama continuing, I truly hope it gets a s2, I look forward to it in hopefully 2021 or 2022 🙏🏻! That’s all I got :)

song kang said ""i know 2020 is almost over but i'm gonna come through real quick and end every other actor's career"" and honestly? we should thank him for that

-

This had it all... the directing, ACTING, plot, ost, visual effects... they went off, good lord. The only - and I mean only - negative thing I have to add is that pacing felt a little patchy at times. But if you want my honest opinion, I feel like it wasn't an objective pacing issue, but a subjective one. Even the slower scenes had full purpose for being the way they were, so I really can't fault the show for that. Either way, my own opinions on pacing were flipped upside down in the final two episodes where things completely exploded. Those episodes were about as close to perfect horror/thriller as you can get.

Side note, I really appreciated the lack of main focus romance. I know it's a huge thing with kdramas, but in shows like this, I would rather focus on the story and found family relationships than taking time to focus on romance. If I want that, I'll go to the romance genre. I know this'll probably be nullified in s2 - I'm sure Eun Yoo's crush will be explored more - but for now I'm gonna milk the fact that they chose not to assert any romance with the main characters (although I will say, if there HAS to be romance... the typically cold Eun Yoo's protective nature over Hyun Soo was actually pretty gratifying and sweet to watch. But, you know. Just best friends would do!!!!!!)

Should I talk about Song Kang again? I don't care, I'm gonna do it. Why did he have to body this role the way he did? Who asked him to do that? Who said ""portray a self-harming, suicidal depressed teenager with abusive & complicated family and social relationships, who then finds out he'll likely become a monster, and must come to terms with what is happening to him as well as slowly building up a relationship with the people around him... and make it nuanced, heartbreaking, and terrifying""? Who asked him to do that and why did this man deliver the way he did? The scene where one moment his eyes are black, veins distorted, furious & completely submerged in his monster psyche, and in the next he's a terrified, exhausted, sobbing teenager, crying in the arms of the man he just killed? How the hell? Y'all really expect me to just move on from this?

Cut the cameras deadass

Stayed loyal in webtoon
I have read this webtoon a long time ago and as I was watching it was actually adapted scene by scene from the comics. This series made me use my phone for over 9 hours because I couldn't stop after seeing the cliffhangers in every episodes. I would say thanks to netflix!
I love the acting! I'm a big fan of Song Kang and Lee dong Hyun and I can say that they improved their acting a lot.
CGI was nicely done although it's pretty obvious that the monsters are computerized it wouldn't take away the fun.
The music was thrilling which made watching more fun. It was lip and thumb biting.
I would definitely watch this again in coming years or before season 2 comes out! (If there will be ;))

AMAZING!
Wow!! I loved this drama so much!!
Please note, I did not look at the webtoon, I didn't even know about it. I'm fresh eyes.

Acting: The acting was absolutely perfect! Every actor/actress did their role so well, I felt every emotion and could really step into their shoes.

Story: The story, overall, is really good! I was hooked. My eyes were basically glued to the screen, and at some moments, I actually had my eyes wide open, while grasping my mouth in shock.
The theme of monsters VS humans is really intriguing, because of the way this movie took it. It's not just ""bad monsters"" vs ""good guys"". It goes soooo much deeper than that. I absolutely love that dynamic.
Some characters are well-developed. Some art not. But the most important ones-- you can clearly see the changes.
I do have to say, though, that some parts are not explained fully clearly enough, and were so sudden/out there, that I often had to rewind a bit.

Music: LOL I don't know who picked the music, but honestly, some of the music was really random/out of place, and did not fit the scene at all. It felt like I was watching a normal quiet movie scene, but some kid was playing music near me.

Effects: I LOVE the special effects, makeup, ALL OF IT!!! Wow!!! Especially one creepy scene in episode 10, I replayed it, because it was so EPIC and so dang aesthetic. As an artist, I was screaming!

More than just about surviving
This drama is more than just about surviving but also teaches that we must learn how to control human desire. My favorite thing about this drama is that it didn’t focus on how only a man can be strong but it showed that women, elderly, disabled, and even children can also be as strong and fearless as men. This is one of the biggest issues that our society faces to date and i’m glad this drama touched on it. There are undeserved deaths or sacrifices in the drama but in reality, these should serve as a warning or wake up call to the people to do good and feel good.

This is directed by the director of Goblin and DOTS so I had really high expectations (fortunately, it was met). I don’t have anything that I dislike in this drama except the undeserved deaths but they were necessary to the story so i’ll pass on it. I think the story was also good! I had questions at the beginning and were answered as I continued to watch. I had more questions at the end that only a season 2 could answer. ? I just can’t wait for season 2. Knowing Netflix, it’d probably take more than a year before they release a new season which sucks.

About acting... there were a lot of familiar faces, supporting characters and antagonists from other dramas but in Sweet Home, they acted as heroes (even if they have shitty personalities). They were all great tbh. I didn’t find any unconvincing acting, only shitty characters which means their acting was good enough to convince their viewers that they are awful people ?.

I have not heard of this drama before, but I was suddenly introduced to it my by friend and the big billboard in Hongdae, Seoul, which advertises this Netflix original. I loved it! And I believe that any horror/sci-fi genre lover will do so as well. To summarise, I feel like this drama was somewhere in between The Walking Dead and Attack on Titan. The CGI was throwing me off the first couple of episodes, but overall, it was a great effort for Korean production working alongside Netflix. Personally, I have not read the Webtoon, but apparently, it is a lot different story-wise, so I might just pick the Webtoon up. But the characters were immaculate and the character development was very strong. I grew really close to some actors and their roles, hopefully there is a season 2 to continue the story.

From someone who didn't read the webtoon version
As I never read the webtoon version, so I don't have things to compare between the two. I'd say this is one of the best drama for 2020. I was expecting this for its visual alone that I was skeptical if they could make good special effect for the monsters. And I could say that everything wrapped up great. From the acting, the story, and obviously the visual. That I hooked up from the very first episode and ended up finished it in one sitting.

From the start, I was awed by how realistic and disturbing the monsters are. Though to be frank, it was more disturbing than I've imagined and I got goosebumps nearly in every monsters scenes but that shows how good and realistic the visual are. I forgot the feeling of watching SAW series and this reminds me a lot of it. So, if anyone that are sensitive, I would not recommend this. Too much trigger warnings. But if you think you could bear it, then the story alone is interesting and makes me wondering which one would die first as more twist keep coming in. I bawled my eyes a lot for the last few episodes and I'm not complaining at all. Maybe some of the BGM that I think wasn't give so much impact to the scenes shown.

No matter how good the visual is, if it's not supported by good acting, it'd be a failure after all. But everyone including the minor roles, as for me, are perfectly conveyed the emotions and tensions throughout the episodes. I could sympathize with their anger, frustration, laughter, sweet moments, sadness and pain. And I didn't expect this to come from this kind of series.

Hence, this is one of the best physiological thriller drama I've ever watched but honestly, I don't think I'd able to rewatch this since I'll probably get too sensitive if I watch this kind of scenes too much. BUT it's definitely a worth to watch drama for once in a lifetime and I highly recommend it for those who are into psychological thriller and don't mind any gore scenes to show up.

Worth watching
This was an absolute stunning masterpiece. Sweet Home is truly an extraordinary kdrama and it definitely did justice to the Webtoon comic. Way too good. Although the ending killed me bc my tears were hydrating my face way too much. this whole thing i such a gooooooooooood Kdrama, it may be different from the Rom-Com Kdramas were used to but this show is in a WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL. I really enjoyed it, i really wish Season 2 will come early. I TOTALLY LOVED THE WHOLE THING. this whole thing i such a gooooooooooood Kdrama, it may be different from the Rom-Com Kdramas were used to but this show is in a WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL.

Amazing Amazing ...did i mention Amazing????
Where do i start ???
The first thing that catches your eye is the CGI along with costume and makeup, you can really see they put in a lot of effort to make things seem as realistic as possible.
The cast had superb acting not to mention they are all insanely gorgeousssss
This show is definitely on the dark side, it makes you question who the real monsters are :()
I was on the edge of my seat after every episode...i cant count how many times i got goosebumps ....

Im really hoping for a season 2
definitely gonna re-watch this when i have the time ;)

50 minutes felt like 20
Sweet Home is a series that made me invested from start to finish. Something that was 50+-minutes episodes started to feel like 20-minutes episodes, and all I wanted to do was to go to the next one. There wasn't a moment where I sat back and wished that I did something else.
I would say that the story is more action-related than horror related, even though there were some really great horror aspect designs in the series.
The story has good character developments and a good storyline, with great actors. Especially Go Min Si who always make me want to throw her characters out the window as she plays such bitchy characters in what I've seen her in so far. Kudos to them all.

I'm usually a person that thinks that VFX can sometimes mess up everything when it comes to a series, which often makes me stop watching. So naturally in the first episode I was skeptical, but as I progressed through the series the VFX grew on me, and I'm happy they chose to do what they did.

Music wise: Please, stop using the same song over and over. Would be nice to hear something else than Imagine Dragons ""Warrior"" once in a while. Probably one of the few complaints I have.

Other than that it was a great watch, would probably re-watch in the future.

Highly Recommend
So I’ll just start off by saying I don’t ever watch shows with “monsters” but I heard this show was somewhat gory, so of course I had to watch. I definitely did not regret watching it, it was an amazing show. The storyline was very well planed out, and there were a lot of surprises. As the show went on I also found myself loving all the characters, like the character development was so good. Now the reason I didn’t give it a 10 is because the monsters were pretty cheesy looking and I got sick and tired of hearing the song Warriors by Imagine Dragons, let’s be honest the song did not fit any of the scenes and probably should’ve just been left out all together, not to mention they played it like a million times.

Everything is amazing

We want at least 5 seasons !!! But Netflix has canclled shows like daredevil and punisher .... I wish someone else took this up .
Every single monsters is so detailed and so insane. I loved how they didn't show many things which the webtoon had, now they show it in the season 2. Amazing acting from Song Kang, Lee Shi Young, Lee Do Hyun and everyone. Everything single scene was a slay. One of the best Korean drama of 2020. Must watch! They way I panicked in every episode is very scary.

What I think
TBH it's not 10/10 or 9/10 it's more of an 8

Why? Episode 1-5 were a mess there wasn't much development in 1-5 there was some but not much. They could have fixed it and made it shorter.
Now 6-10 This is when things get exciting and interesting.
If you are to watch the show I say skim 1-5 and watch it 6 onwards

They haven't stuck to the webtoon for those asking they have changed the end alot
People who have died in webtoon lived. Those who died in the drama have lived in webtoon. Which is weird.
Which mean they are changing up everything and making it different. This means that making season 2 will take a while coz they don't have anything to copy from unless the writer has already written season 2.

But despite this I hope they have a better season 2! Most shows can't follow up with a great season 2 hopefully this one does.

Good Monster Movie Fun
This story is more about what it means to be human and to want to live than it is about the monsters exactly. In fact they act more like a metaphor.
Some of the special effects are amazing, some are a little campy. Most monsters are well designed but a little over-the-top cartoony which I think actually works in its favor since it keeps the show from being TOO scary to the point you can't watch it without staying up all night long. The monsters are just good fun!
Main leads are all great. The two male main leads especially do a lot of heavy lifting but the WHOLE cast is great. Lots of amazing characters to root for (and root against).
Be prepared for emotions !!

As Webtoon readers, of course I can't help but compare
I knew there're new characters in the drama ver. but I'm completely confused with the involvement of military & the gangster team who suddenly appear and vanish in a moment without giving much impact to the story beside bringing the 'liquid' monster into them.

I love how they depicts almost most of the storyline from webtoon tho some are indeed different to gave more sentimental feeling. But I feel the lack of explanation, for people who didn't read the webtoon, to comprehend the story, how they can show this 'monsterisation' is due to human desire. The webtoon give me a jab on how deep the story about ""the monster is in me"" and I think the story goal is still far away from end comparing to the webtoon as I understood how they 're-born'. I truly cried on how they ended Eunhyuk character in the drama, I mean, I cried. It was one of the best scene beside the moment Hyunsu turns and hug Dusik. I understand that this is not over yet for the series as the monster are still there. Wishing for Season 2!

Music wise, I'm er... not a fan of it. They might come with something more intense and I just feel that this doesn't match with the atmosphere of the story. The cast is beyond my imagination. I love all the cast and how they bring the character into live action. I can feel the sadness and anger while watching it, thumbs up for the cast.

Perfect to binge watch
If you're looking for a thriller, gore, or action filled drama, then this one might be for you. As someone who didn't read the webtoon, it didn't affect my judgement nor I've expected anything from this, because I have zero knowledge on how things went in the webtoon. In my personal point of view based only on what I've watched, I think this is a good drama. Not a big fan of gore, thriller, horror nor action but I actually liked this. The pace of the story was just perfect, from how they cut each episode to have the audience wanting to watch the next episode immediately, to how impactful each episode was. It has this aspect that keeps me on my seat and totally focused on the things that are happening. For the characters, the actors truly played them well, from the main roles to the supporting roles. (Song Kang was really cute btw). I was hooked because of how well they put into life each of their characters. For the effects and monsters, they were also well done– disgustingly good. Actually I've seen the four actors (Lee Do Hyun, Lee Jin Wook, Song Kang, and Lee Si Young) in Running Man when they appeared to promote the drama and because of that, I got a glimpse of the story. Basically humans become monsters when they give in to their desires. That I think is a good life lesson, that we should not let our desires take over and eat us. This drama is basically telling us that we humans are the ones who are making us transform into something else and that's because of our unstoppable greed over something we wanted so bad. I also really like the heartwarming interactions between characters and how they slowly grew to each other, within that 10 episodes. The only reason why I'm giving this a 9 and not a perfect 10 is because I was looking for something else (or Idk if it is more on personal preference) and also because we got that cliffhanger ending. Wishing for a next season because I want to see more of this. Overall, I really like this drama and it is one of those which is perfect to binge watch when you're up for a genre of this type.

Welcome to Sweet Home, a story about humanity, sacrifice and about choosing life...

I loved it,i think it matters a lot that i went in with the ""right"" mentality to even name it so as it was a better experience going into it without having the high expectations of a webtoon lover as i knew the story more or less and over the years i've read here and there but wasn't invested so even the changes or so didn't effect me that much so those 10h or so went by so fast(i didn't believe i would binge it staying all night till 10am heh,another point to me) and so many emotions,especially with the ones who died as to be fair i cared the most about Jae-heon,really wanted him to survive and get out with Ji-soo…Song Kang was amazing,i totally rooted for him,think it's his best role to date and for me he delivered it,i felt so much sadness and anger for his backstory as his act of kindness was what turned his life in a living hell and other characters backstory were paintful as well…Another great point was their woman representation as the women were mostly the ones taking the main stage and front line when most of the guys(not or main 4)were trying to hide(like when they caught the spider monster),overcoming their fear faster and joing hands to protect themselves, something fresh as we usually always see the men in kdramas being the brave etc ones…I was somehow frustrated that the ones who died deserved to live but life is unfair and it says nowhere that good brave guys end up surviving and thegreedy self centered ones don't...Another great point was the whole atmosphere and the lack of information our group had access as I think part of the major fear aside from well,the monsters at each corner was that no one knew much of anything and maybe that was intended...Of course getting the full straight answers rather than small hints would have been great(i actually don't mind) but taking into context the whole story it made sense that no one knew,at least the general public making it all the more scary...
A great cast indeed and Lee Shi young's just WOW,aside from already a great actress she is body goals!
Hope we'll really get a second season as i really would want to see them explore the world and monsters outside of the complex building as they already have in their hands a rich world worthy of in deep and complex view…
The OST was also fantastic and my personal favorites were Tears of Sweet Home by Gae Mi, Park Junghwan & 4 Strings of Sweet Home by Gae Mi.

Recomand it very much!

2nd season is a must, please!
I just watched the last episode(10th) and I can't believe the second season isn't yet under production. Google says fans are desperate for it but I feel different, a little bit lost, anxious and I have a headache because the final episode was too much mysterious I can't bear with the ambiguous interpretations going on in my brain now. The story is overwhelming, the events are well organized, logical sequences, most importantly, 8 months of production, this is unbelievably amazing, the drama crew must have worked themselves so hard to get it aired on December 18th when we're all struggling with the pandemic and casual lockdowns as well as new infectees every day, death cases and our families being involved, this drama makes you really feel like home and I feel like I am exactly like the survivors, I didn't reach my sweet home yet. Well, I hope we do by the next season, I myself need a second season for myself to find my sweet home since I never felt home before, I am still looking for one.
Moreover, the music used in this drama was wisely chosen, an award for choosing the right music must be created if it wasn't existing already.
Can't help but talk about the OST, it's way too much fitting into the drama theme as well as the graphics.
Many actors deserve respect for being professional and faithful to the roles they played in this drama, it didn't' feel like acting at all. I will add them to my fav list.
My impression is beyond imagination. I don't deny I didn't expect a lot when I started watching the drama, I liked the poster only without reading the plot summary, now I am dying for a second season.

This drama is a cinematic masterpiece. Its production is excellent. The story got me literally on the edge of my seat from the start to finish. I love the actors more and how they were barefaced-- with all the dust, dirt, blood, and all. At a time when everything is very uncertain and people are forced into isolation, Sweet Home tells the importance of collective living. It is hard, but it's one way to survive. Sometimes, you are even to put them above yourself for the safety of the majority. Overall, I love this drama so much. Looking forward for the second season!

Not only the monsters are bad
This is a great drama I've already watched twice.
The main and supporting cast all give excellent performances, including the children.
The effects of living in an environment where society has broken down leads to very different behaviours for the characters, as they really need to pull together in order to survive. The changing opinions and morals of some, as it becomes apparent no one is safe from infection, makes for many characters developing with each episode.
Our human establishment is yet again to blame for messing with things that shouldn't be and fearing everything different. Tarring everyone exposed, with the same brush, can also be seen as the way in which so many laid blame after the outbreak of Covid. Lessons never seem to be learned, as this has and will, happen time and time again.
The pace is a mix of slow burning, menacing and violent. It isn't a particularly happy watch, but there are many touching moments.
The soundtrack is excellent too.
I believe Netflix are waiting for ratings stats before committing to series 2 and I so hope it goes ahead, otherwise the ending is less than pleasing; that would be my only complaint.
I LOVED it.

legit amazing
I read the webtoon vers of Sweet Home starting from 2018 when the author started publishing the chapters. The live action vers did a great job of following the original storyline. the casting is actually amazing...everyones seems so fit for their character..the ost is amazing too. I love how they incorporated warriors from imagine dragons cuz that was in the league of legends soundtrack too which totally makes sense. The cinematography is on another level of genius and the fact that they actually casted Troy James for the spider monster...wow..all in all id give it a 10/10 but bc the ending is so incomplete I'll give it a 9/10 since we're gonna have to wait and see the answers to all our questions. (but honestly the choice of casting all these iconic actors and actresses was genius) probably the best horror/thriller out there

As a WEBTOON reader, I was pleasantly surprised
I was really excited for this drama adaptation ever since I finished reading the WEBTOON, and the show did not disappoint. If you are looking for something that keeps everything from the WEBTOON into the drama, this is not what this show does. However, I feel like this is even better since it helps to keep you intrigued.

Plot: At the start, the plot was a little slow since I expected they the whole WEBTOON would be put into the 10 episodes. For new watchers, I feel like it’s the perfect pace to try and understand the characters since their development or personalities really define the story. The beginning has the most similarities to the WEBTOON, so it may feel a little repetitive (I found it cool to see how scenes were portrayed in real life). For the middle of the plot, if you were expecting the characters to start going up the building and fight monsters like the original, you’ll be a little disappointed. There is still a lot of action, but the show focuses more on the character development (which is my favorite aspect of every show). By the time you’re in the middle and you’re still contemplating if you want to still watch or not since it’s not as fast as you expected, KEEP WATCHING. The last episode is so worth it in my opinion. I would have been satisfied if the story ended here, but at the very end of the last episode, they leave the opportunity for another season.

Cast: The cast did really good at portraying their characters in my opinion. Maybe it’s because I get really attached to shows, but I felt pretty much every emotion they tried to show. For the monsters, the CGI exceeded my expectations. Of course, they are not 100% realistic, but it’s really close. Since the CGI was really good, I was actually scared to see if some monsters from the WEBTOON would still be shown in the drama (since some of them are kinda scary).

Music: I really liked the OST for the show, but I feel like a lot of the music wasn’t the best choice to go along with the scene on the screen. I would definitely listen to some of the songs on my own.

Rewatch Value: I don’t usually rewatch shows (I’ve only rewatched 2 fully out of I don’t know how many dramas I’ve watched), but I see myself rewatching this in the future. There’s enough depth to the characters that you would notice more about each person when you rewatch (keeping the show interesting). There were also many impactful scenes that just don’t lose rewatch value (I see myself rewatching the last episode many times).

Okay. I now totally get what the hype is about!!!
[Disclaimer] this review is based on my own opinions of the drama. Thank you for understanding. :)

I did not expect this drama to keep me up at night and make me binge-watch it. I've hated horror as a genre ever since I was little and I never grew into liking it. But something drew me in... at first it was the soundtrack and the background music used and then the story became gripping and I just couldn't let go.

I'm not sure I would re-watch the whole thing, but certain parts for sure. I liked the production, the actors were well chosen as well, but what shocked me the most was that even characters I thought would be flat and only served filler characters were actually written as multi-dimensional characters, you just needed to give them time to show their true nature. And I absolutely loved that.

I highly recommend this drama. It's totally worth the hype.

ANIME LOVERS AND KDRAMA FANS UNITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't be fooled sweet home is not sweet but bitter in reality. A short story of the people living in an apartment trying to fight off DEMONIC BEINGS which is EPICCCCC. The graphic designs are perfect and the monster don't look like a 1$ budget kids cartoon show. The story is FAST PACED pact with cool action scenes and EPIC MUSIC.

The characters in the show are all unique and interesting, some people even have different favourites. Like any Netflix thriller, CURSE WORDS are used to make the character seem more vulnerable and emotional. You can feel the TERROR and the ANXIOUSNESS of the characters desperately trying to survive.

Surprisingly awesome
At first, i was skeptical. Whether that was because our main character didnt feel like a main character or that he was one of the most unlikable main characters ive seen in a long while. Whether it was because there were too many characters to focus on just one or whether it was because there were simply too many monsters. However, for some reason i kept watching and im glad i did. To those who aren't sure if they'd like it, you will. Its not just about monsters and action but a story. I have to admit i ended up loving the main character Hyun Su and understanding him. With all that said, i hope to see him back for a season 2

Took me a few times to get through the first 2 episodes. It made me a little too anxious, so I had to take a couple a breathers. By the third episode, I was sucked into the story. Was half way through, when a friend told me it's based off a manhwa, checked it out and realized it was saved under to read section of my account :) This series was enjoyable from beginning to the end. Emotional roller coaster! Scary, exciting, sad, frustration, satisfaction, suspicion, hope, and etc.

Characters were wonderfully developed and was a joy to watch ALL of them grow as a person. Not just the main cast.

Like the art style. Design and animation of the monsters are AMAZING!!!

Love the music! It is unique and matches the moments really well.

Love that it shows all the different types of issues we all go through in life. How we all fight our problems each day. No matter how we had lived our lives, how others see us, who we truly are, in the end what will we choose to do. Will we be consumed and give up, or will we continuously fight to do the right thing.

This is a Netflix original story
Before I start writing this review let me say that I've read the webtoon first before watching this drama. To be more specific I was an ongoing reader of the webtoon. So sweet home webtoon is like an emotion to me, that's why when I first heard that this webtoon is gonna have a drama adaption I was super hyped up about it. My review is gonna be biased but I'll definitely try to justify my words from the point of view of a webtoon reader.

Okay first of all let me start writing this review by saying this THEY FU*KED UP THE STORY FROM THE ORIGINAL WEBTOON. Now let's get into it.

Story - Like I said earlier they fu*ked up the story. Sweet home webtoon was about the residents who were trapped in an apartment for days, their struggles, their emotions, their strong desire to go back to the sweet times with their loved ones.

When you'll read it you'll feel like you're also trapped in that apartment along with the residents. It doesn't matter if you're an ongoing reader or binge reader, YOU'LL FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ALSO TRAPPED WITH THEM. Getting out of the apartment was next to impossible in the webtoon (no one would dare to do it alone), going from 2nd floor to 3rd floor was breathtaking. But the drama doesn't make you feel like that. They made it look like it's so easy to move around the building as long as you're a half human. And there was this character who went out of the building out of nowhere and came back safe lmao.

Some of the monsters were drawn so well that I was actually scared of reading the webtoon at night. Even one night I had illusions of those monsters while laying in my bed! But the monsters in the drama.... I'll be honest, all the monsters looked like cartoons. I wasn't afraid at all. I laughed when they appeared on the screen.

The lead characters had really good friendship. The way they formed their friendship/ relationship during the pandemic was so beautiful. But here they RUINED almost every single relationship. They literally CHANGED all the characters personality.

Each and every characters thought process before turning into a monster was a tearjerker. The way Hyun always resisted the inner demon in him was so so emotional. And Hyun's character development was the most satisfying part of the entire webtoon! But in the drama... *sigh*

And not to mention there wasn't any character in the webtoon who was ""all about braveness"". No matter which character it was, all of them feared the monsters at some point. But in the drama some characters were on superhuman level. They make it look so easy to fight monsters. yaay!!

And one more thing, I didn't like Lee Si Young's character at all. Her character was never in the webtoon but somehow I was still looking forward to this character. But after watching the drama I can say that it was the most terrible decision to add that new character. They probably wanted to show us a brave female character but to me Her character wasn't brave at all. All her actions were childish and stubborn. Her character was the most unrealistic character I've ever seen in my life. Roaming around the city with a bike during this pandemic and coming back absolutely safe. on top of that she was pregnant. seriously! No hate to the actress, I just found her character annoying and unnecessary.

Now let's not forget how they included that military sh!t instead of focusing on monsters. Poor monsters didn't even get half of the screentime they got in the webtoon lol.
In the drama they totally skipped the 2nd half of the webtoon. Wow there are so many things that I can point out. But the review is getting longer. So I'll stop here.

The only good thing about this drama was the last 3-4 episodes. Because that's when they picked up THEIR STORY and STOPPED INSULTING sweet home webtoon's story.

Acting- the casting for this drama was terrific. I don't have any complain here. Everyone nailed their character. I just wish they didn't change the personalities of each character.

Music- I liked the ost. But it didn't match with some scenes. In the webtoon Jisu writes a comfort song while being trapped in the apartment. Later Hyun names the song ""sweet home"" (that's how deep the webtoon was). They could actually include this scene in the drama. It could be a tearjerker ost for us. But whatever....

Rewatch: I will rewatch this drama if someday any of my sibling/ cousin/ friend asks me to watch it with them. Watching a show with someone is quite fun. Because you don't really need to focus on the show. You can just pass the time by talking with them :D

Thoughts about Season 2: I'm not looking forward to season 2 but I will watch it someday. Because this time I'll be prepared to watch a Netflix original story instead of looking for Sweet home webtoon's story.

Finally, I don't think the director/ screenwriter of this drama have ever read the webtoon. They just took the idea from the webtoon and made their own story and of course they ruined it.

If you're an avid fan of the webtoon (like me) than please convince yourself that it's a Netflix original story before watching it.. Of course it's hard to think like that since they named it after the webtoon but yeah just do it. And those who didn't read the webtoon yet, I'm sure you'll enjoy this drama. Go for it. But if you have time why not give the webtoon a try? :D

Sweet Home is a Perfect Home!
Sweet Home is a Perfect Home. A legendary drama that I will remember for the rest of my life for being perfect in story, acting, production and soundtrack. My only second-ever overall rating of 10/10, and it truly deserves it. I was literally never bored or thinking about 'what I want to eat after this?' when watching this - in which I definitely do in dramas that I'm not entirely engaged with. The story really hit home (no pun intended) with me, not like it was too relatable or anything, but relatable enough for me to experience all the emotions that producers want to feel while watching this - anticipation, goose bumps, jump scares, curiosity. I binged this so easily (Again something very rare for me to do), I was curious about 'Sweet Home' so much there were nights were I couldn't get to sleep because of it. Will there be a second season? I hope so!!

All-in-all, not only horror fans will enjoy this. It's one crazy road trip from episode 1 to episode 10, so make sure to wear a seatbelt.

Hyde and Me.
Based on a popular webtoon, Sweet Home received significant attention back while it aired last year. I did not have any prior idea about the story before I dove in. Only that the red hued poster hinted intense blood shed and an MDL article that introduced several ""monsters' '. The hype doesn't lie: the Green Home apartments' residents face the nightmare of their life when an epidemic-like condition that turns people into monsters strikes them. Told through the eyes of Cha Hyun-Su, a 19-year-old boy who had just moved in, the series follows the residents as they struggle to survive and hope for an escape from their bleak future. All this whilst they fight monsters and risk turning into one themselves.

☆ The plot… Well, if you are someone who is familiar with post-apocalyptic or dystopian genres, then the basic background of the drama can be hinted right from the opening scene. There's nothing novel about it and I found the progress of 'that' particular subplot partly predictable. But, it did not suck away the thrill and anticipation. There is a high chance that further revelations arise in the future, so I'll give this one the benefit of doubt.

☆ The Characters are the real highlight of the show. And the poster lied. We meet a number of characters whose backstories are intensely explored. The name of the drama 'Sweet Home' from my perspective, doesn't stand for a safe and warm place to stay. It's rather the home that the remaining survivors struggle to build by slowly growing accustomed to their rough circumstances and starting to trust in each other. The plot lacked substance, but it did not lack in the character department. No one was present just as a plot device, but the very base of the story dumbs all of them together in a rather unfavourable manner.
All the cast were spot on. Their performances were incredibly good and overwhelmingly with the right emotions. The two child actors in particular were highly convincing.

☆ The entire story takes place in an apartment complex. The drama, as a result, is cramped, dark and bloody. It created the right ambience to feel the tension whenever necessary. The first two episodes were particularly disturbing, but the feeling disappears once we get the hang of it. Another plus side of the drama was that it did not have any gratuitous violence or scenes for the sake of it.

☆ While the background music was highly addictive, I'm sure that I wouldn't have chosen Warrior by Imagine Dragons as the ultimate battle song. It sounded cool in one or two episodes, but managed to ruin the mood, particularly at the end of EP8. It was supposed to be a highly emotional experience, but all I had in mind was how somebody thought to ruin the moment with such a terrible choice of song. The soundtrack in the final three episodes was perfect though.

☆ Despite all that, I felt that there was a distinct absence of purpose in the initial episodes. There was a repetitive cycle going on for a long time until something urgent pushed the leader 'four-eyes' into taking drastic measures. It was good for a single watch, but definitely not worth going all over again for a second time. The drama stressed a lot on the characters and their struggles individually for the first half of the episodes. The leading character, Cha Hyun-Su barely speaks or appears for an extended period of time. The episodes and screen time was equally distributed for multiple characters. The latter half of the drama is when things get into motion and the story gains momentum. It's finale was explosive and intriguing enough to convince me to give the second season a try.

☆ While there were scattered minor plotholes, one in particular was glaringly obvious. It was never brought up or resolved in the end. It shouldn't have been the case, but it almost felt as if the writers knew no other way to wrap up the arc and decided to neglect it. Also, the concept behind the 'monsters' was only mentioned in passing and never got any proper explanation.

There are enough details that are yet to be explained and I hope that the second season does this. It lacked the thrill I had expected, but it was an almost satisfying watch. I loved the various characters as they fought for hope. Though I don't think I'll rewatch it, the time that I spent was definitely worth it.

this drama is for the ones who love thrillers/fantasy.
I loved this drama,the actors played their roles mesmerizingly and each episode takes your breath away because you don’t know what to expect. The story is about how humanity already ends and everyone starts to become monsters,other people try to survive and not to turn into them. There will be sad moments where you will cry rivers :( Also the ending makes you to watch season 2 immediately. I recommend it to everyone especially to people who love the genre of thriller . Enjoy <3

The 'Warriors' song is stuck in my head now
I was going to write a long review but everything I wanted to say has pretty much been said.. but anyways I really enjoyed this series! I put it on hold for a long time after the first few episodes, but when I came back to it, I blazed through it really quickly.
I think the actors did an amazing job (even though I disliked half the characters), and the production was so good, seriously some of the shots were breathtaking. It did feel a little rushed though, especially towards the end. But hopefully, everything will be cleared up next season.

Bloody good!
This drama had a slow start, but bloody hell this series is so good. The character driven drama essentially is about the human relationships and their struggles against their own demons more than about the monsters. There's a good amount gore and humor that I often find in B movies (which I love btw), lots of blood, lots of action, lots of twists, amazing characters, STUNNING cinematography, love the soundtrack, and I'm pretty sure I now have a girl crush on the badass Lee Si-young.

Rewatch value - I almost never rewatch anything, same goes with this one.

At first I thought that this was going to be a simple drama just about some people fighting monsters but it turned out to be so much more!

Now I can fully understand why people prefer Song Kang's performance in this drama over some of his romantic roles because damn he really did amazing. The other characters were great too. Of course, my favourite character died again because yes everytime I have a favourite character in a drama that has a high chance of them dying, they always do. 😭

The CGI monsters were scaring me so much at the beginning, it was almost unreal! Like I was legit thinking about dropping the drama somewhen along the first and second episode because the monster with the long tongue and the one with half of the head sliced off were scaring me so much. The other one that came later.. not so much, to be honest. Especially the flying eye one, it was just funny how weird that looked. 😂

My final rating is 8.5/10 but I can't wait for the second season.

A Horror Staple
As you can see from the headline, Sweet Home was a horror staple. The first thing I noticed in it was the editing of the monsters and the costumes. The team did really well with that. They deserve the highest compliments for that. It was really realistic to the point where I got scared. I am usually unfazed by watching horror shows or movies at 2 in the morning, but this was done so well that I could only watch one episode a day because it left me quite unsettled.

Moving on to the story, I would say that it is not predictable at all. It was actually a tad bit hard to understand but after 7 episodes I finally got it. It was fairly well written, but the cliffhanger was one of the worsts (or should I say best) ever. I'm still waiting for a season two but there was and has been no activity about that announced yet.

As for the cast, I can't express how much I love each and every single one of the members. Let's start with Song Kang. His versatility is just beyond words~ from high school popular boy (in Love Alarm) to demonic and monstrous teen. Secondly, Lee Jin Wook really had that raw feeling to him. He portrayed the role really well and I can't see anyone else doing that role at the moment. Lee Shi Young just represents were character so well; she really brings emotions like desperation and characteristics from her character's firefighter experience to life. Lee Do Hyun (damn, he's hot) started climbing up my favorite actors list after this drama; at first, I thought he would be one of those actors that could only play funny roles but his duality was shown well here. Finally, Go Min Si portrayed my hero Lee Eun Yoo so well; she's such a badass naive teen and that's something I can only dream to be. Her acting, as always, is top-tier; I didn't expect any less. Honestly, whoever casted did a really great job *insert clapping soundtrack*!

Overall, I would RECCOMEND this drama if you like the zombie and horror concept.

This was one of my favorite dramas. In my opinion, this was perfect and I watched that three times, even my mom watched that!
Let's start with the acting of the main leads. That was wonderful and now Lee Do Hyun and Go Min Si are some of my favorite actors of the new generation. Their characters and themselves are really different and the fact that they can play a role like this so well is amazing (I really enjoy Youth of May too). Song Kang is a really good actor but the type of character he played was not my favorite but he did a really good job! To be honest I was really impressed with the acting of everyone, even the support roles, and the children.
The plot was very interesting and the action scenes with Warriors by Imagine Dragons were so energetic. The monsters were really well made and realistic to the point that sometimes I was scared by them and the writers were really original with the choices of the features of the monsters.
This is the only drama that I rewatched and it feels like watching that for the first time every time, even a scene that I cried every time I rewatched that I cried but maybe it's only me because I cry very easily. Now I can't wait for the second season because I have so many questions that I want answers to and some theories that I want to be resolved. In the end, I really recommend this k-drama for all the people that want a really good horror drama and some different from the rom-com ones; and it's a really good starting for being a horror/thriller/crime dramas watchers as it did for me.
(Sorry if I made any writing mistake but I'm not a native English speaker)

A hopeful gore-fest about monsters and monsters within us
WOW. I just finished this.

Let me start by saying it is definitely very gorey. If you can't stomach that, you should stay away from this drama.
But it is so much more than just gore: The monsters are, at least in the beginning, incredibly fun to watch. It has a certain comic/anime feel to it. The acting is incredibly good and the music fitting, both in action-loaded an emotional scenes.

I loved the setting of this run-down house with all these characters that have somewhat lost their way in life but are rediscovering what it means to be human and alive.

In the end, the real monsters are not always those that have transformed, but those within us. The season finale was epic. I cannot wait for more. I also really really love Song Kang in this role - amazing acting with adorable monster eyes.

Quite different from the webtoon, decent standalone.
Let me begin with telling you that Sweet Home as an adaptation starts of great, there’s a chilling feeling from the first episode and many similarities with the webtoon, but unfortunately things don’t quite stay along the same line. So if you go in with expectations that you will get something along the same lines as the webtoon, you’ll be disappointed. The characters that you might have loved while reading the comic have pretty much been sidelined and an extra character is introduced who is given a major plot line which starts to appear very funny (unintentional) after a point. I wanted to see the dynamics between many of the characters, but sadly there’s hardly any interaction between them. Few characters like Wook and Jisu were absolutely annihilated. Despite being the lead, we see Hyun Soo as a pushover. None of the nerdiness of Hyuk and his complex character is highlighted. His relationship with his younger sister (whose age seems to have been increased and a romantic angle with the lead is introduced) is hostile at best.

It’s a little difficult for me to see how I would have felt if I hadn’t read the webtoon, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more but still been disappointed with the military arc that was introduced. Despite all the changes that I didn’t like, it’s still a decent watch. There’s a lot of gore and creepiness and lots of blood. Though it ends on a cliffhanger while the webtoon gives you more closure, it’s still a watchable story. The CGI takes a while to get used to, and the OST feels a little repetitive and out of place at times, but it’s all right.

A must watch for those who like faster paced shows and drop slow paced shows.
This is now my favorite Korean drama of all time. And no, I'm not over exaggerating.

One benefit of this show is that for people with short attention spans, this drama will keep you hooked. As someone with severe ADHD, I don't think I've ever finished a show without periods of time where I forgot about finishing the series. I have dropped so many shows. I have also taken months or a year to finish a show. Sweet Home is now the exception. If I could have, I probably would have finished it in one night. This show captivated me to where I was dying to finish it so I could know what happened. Except for the last episode because truthfully I was sad knowing it would be the last episode.

The downside to this faster pace is that a lot of viewers felt that the characters were not fleshed out fully. I can see how this might make sense for the explanations for some of the monsters and I do think that there was probably not enough time to go fully in depth considering this series was only 10 episodes compared to your typical 16 episodes. BUT I personally felt that the characters were actually very well-written (and especially well acted!) if you detach this show from the original webtoon. Plus the faster pace pays off more as a benefit than any of the downsides for me personally.

A second benefit of this show is the production and universe build. The universe isn't like other darker Korean dramas but is more like a Western superhero flick. One scene that stands out is a scene where Cha Hyunsu is shown fighting monsters to BewhY's Side by Side. I love this song, it kind of reminds me a bit of Kanye's Yeezus era. Personally those ballads have always been a huge turn off to me so the grittier, urban vibe was a major plus. I really hope that in the future we can see more dramas with hip hop OST songs as opposed to the cut+paste ballad. Also side note, we're just going to ignore that Imagine Dragons song. It never happened.

Lastly, the acting was incredible. I've read a lot of praise for Lee Dohyun, but let's get this straight--everyone was phenomenal. There was not a weak link in the acting. Even though some webtoon fans complained about Pyeon Wook's character's deviation, Lee Jinwook did an incredible job. It isn't much because I'm a terrible actor myself but at one point I had a moment watching him that I thought, ""This is what excellent acting is."" But great job to everyone involved. I loved this show so much and I hope there's a second season.

P.S. I read an interview where Lee Dohyun said he wants to be a king of romcoms. I really hope he considers other action/thriller roles because he shined more than ever in this role. Another case is Song Kang who is known for Love Alarm but also got to shine more than ever as Cha Hyunsu with his legitimate talent that you couldn't see as well in Love Alarm. Ik they'll never see this comment but if anyone can relay the message to give thought to taking more serious/challenging roles in the future please do so!

Worth watching
It was pretty amazing. Nowadays in K-dramaworld, Jst a few dramas are made of this genre and even if they make it , the casts are usually some action-based actors. But in this one they casted Song Kang and Lee Do Hyun , both of them are my favs and I've always watched their romance-genre dramas... So it was really a thrilling experience for me, watching them in this series. And as usual, both of them proved their worth, by acting perfectly.
Since i haven't read the webtoon yet. So ,the story was really good and interesting . But as the episodes goes , somehow when it reached at the middle of the story, the monsters were gone. And there it focused mostly on themselves fighting with the bad guys/enemy(whatever) and the ending left me on cliffhanger.
So Im obviously in need of another season so that it can explain me -
1. Why and how Do hyun/Eun hyuk was killed (as he could've gone to that tunnel again)
2. Why did the Si yeong/firefighter girl changed herself with the millitary?
3. Song kang was saved by that another monster friend?
4. What happened after Song kang/he was taken away?

Have you watched Strangers from Hell and decided that you need more? Or maybe you think that this drama would be much better with, I don’t know, mutated monsters? What if beyond completely weird tenants, the building would be isolated from the outside world? If you thought all of those things and wanted to watch something like that, I have a good news for you, somebody thought about it as well, and here we have: Sweet Home.

Right off the bat in the first episode we’re introduced to some of the characters and we get to know surroundings. So we have this shabby old building filled with weird characters that we don’t know what they’ll do next. They are absolutely white cards and often they turn out to be not what we first think them to be. All characters are a bit (or actually very) weird and honestly, it’s hard to trust anybody, even when we get to know them a bit better.

This drama is equally amazing as it is confusing. We don’t get the whole spectrum of informations, we don’t know what’s going outside of building, what’s the reason for monster invasion, what is the reason not everyone turning into monsters. This is the reason why this drama is so unpredictable.

And let’s talk about special effects. They’re not perfect but they’re enough to get the atmosphere absolutely right. Sometimes they look like a stop motion animation but they look very good. Together with lightning and scenography they give us the feeling of an old fashioned gore horror.
Plus music and we have a perfect combination. The soundtrack will stay with me for a long time, especially Warriors by Imagine Dragons. Even though it’s my husband’s ringtone, from now on, I’ll only think about those epic episode ending scenes that this song was a perfect background music to.

And let’s talk about acting. Because Song Kang, among others does such great job here, that I had to actually google him to check where I’ve seen him before because his acting was just so different here comparing to Love Alarm that I haven’t recognise him right away. Along with him we have Lee Do Hyun, who even though very young is already a recognisable face in drama world, and also does amazing job. Them both plus couple of other actors (if I had to list all good actors here, this review would turn out to be too long) and we have very good, very balanced cast where all members create very unique characters.

So if you like monster horrors, are not afraid of blood and intestines basically everywhere and have like ten hours of your life to spare I guess you should definitely watch Sweet Home.

The lack of constiency between the Webtoon and the Drama was sad
It was great if you hadn't read the Webtoon, which was very different. They changed and added major characters. I was confused when I saw some of them like ??? I don't remember that. Also, the order of events is very different from the Webtoon, as well as the wasy certain characters died, became monsters, or both. The thing that upset me the most was definetly the whole elevator part, it was very good in the comic and the reason for the shutters being down and them being locked in Green Home connected and made a lot of sense, but in the drama it did not. It was also kinda anticlimactic like man just kinda died?. (trying to avoid minor spoilers :)) I found it VERY upsetting that Jae Heon's part with the shield Du-sik had made (the one that was also a flame thrower) was not there and his ""AND GOD SAID.. *flames spout from shield* LET THERE BE LIGHT"", which was my favorite part in the series was not there. Overall, I was very sad that the events didn't match with the Webtoon and many things were different, if i hadn't read the Webtoon or known about it, I would have had no complaints. (Sorry for the horrible grammar its literally 1:34 AM and I'm too lazy to proofread)

If you like horror genre this gore fest is likely right up your alley
9/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean science fiction, horror drama with 10, 44-59 minute episodes.

Despondent and suicidally depressed, Hyun-soo moves into a large apartment building and continues his life of solitude. That is until strange things begin occurring in the building and he and his neighbors must rely on each other to survive.

See Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young) a character created for the drama (not webtoon) she is an expert martial artist who served in special forces and was also a fire fighter. After her fiancé vanished mere sprays before their wedding, she has trust issues.
Lee Eun-hyuk (Lee Do-Hyundan) is th self designated leader of the group of survivors whose cold rationality makes his leadership strong but cause there’s to consider him unfeeling. He is a medical student and older brother to Lee Eun-yoo (Go Min-si) a former ballerina who has a chip on her shoulder as she had to quit due to an injury.

Choi Yoon-jae (Go Geon-Han) pretends to be kind to hide among the group from Sang-wook. But he is a human monster of another sort, a Child Predator.

if Movies in the horror genre are your thing then this will likely fit the bill. The monsters were definitely scary and horrific and the fact that the people turn into monsters was in and of itself frightening . That type of transformation was reminiscent of the American movie “The Thing” though only vaguely so. It was interesting the way the people both had to work together while not completely trusting each other to be able to make it through. I liked that there was that central character, the teenage boy, and that he was unique and that he had the monster in him yet was largely able to control it. The series was well paced throughout most of it until towards the end when it got a little chaotic and felt like a lot of people were dying very rapidly. There were also aspects that were not well explained such as why the fire fighter character was suddenly with the military at the very end. The fact that she was working with them had been revealed earlier but it did not seem like she had given them what they wanted enough that she would’ve been able to join them completely. The gangster guy was very different in the television series than in the webtoon where he was more of a goofy character and much more likable. For the most part they stuck to the webtoon enough that it was clear that it was made based on it and yet deviated enough to make it work in the television format. They left it open for more seasons as everything was not wrapped up and in the fact there is additional story line in the webtoon indicates that there is story left for more episodes to the series or another season. I’m not sure why they decided to only do 10 episodes, 16 or more episodes would have allowed for a more complete telling of the story.

Unexpected Thrilling and Emotional Ride!
To start with, this drama was a killer!... the first episode blew me away... from the tension , the eerie vibe of the location and the surroundings.. The story line was very amazing, didn't feel slow or boring throughout the drama. And the fact that it had only 10 episodes was kind of a bummer, because it was sooo good!... Each character had their ups and downs, and some of the actors played their roles so well, that I hated them to the core (by the way, you will find some annoying characters). I have to talk about the main female lead, she was on fire!!.. If she is in a scene you know its gonna be epic.... At first I thought it was gonna be just a drama filled with jumpscares, monsters, survival.... but it took me on an emotional ride too (did not expect that!).. Like how the human emotions play a very big role in one's survival... The male lead played the emotional scenes with a great sense of agony, pain and anger, something that normally people don't understand. I mean WOW!!! (I'm kind of an emotional person, so this part stood out a lot for me.. personally)... His life story plays a big part in his character's strength.... I'm sooo waiting for the second season. The gangster character gives the drama, its kick, a dark shadowy fearless tough character fighting against monsters with his bare hands.... Damn!!.Look forward for his character too. On top of the amazing cast and screenplay.. the vfx and the ost were on point!!... the ost gave each scene that extra power and fire...This is the first time that I fell in love with the ost form a horror drama.. You can check it out, even before you watch the drama. It's that good!.. my favorites were Side to side -Bewh Y and Warriors - Imagine dragons(Use headphones for a better BOOM!!)... If you are gonna watch this series, believe me you would want the second season to come out faster.

Post-Apocalypse Super Hero Origin Story.
This show took a little bit of getting used to at first cause the ""zombies"" are all super strange and widely varied and it's not really clear initially what makes them that way. Some of them are cartoon level weird. As the show progresses and you learn, as the main characters also learn, what's causing people to turn into really odd and specific zombies things start to make sense. As things start to make sense, you begin to understand the deeper social meaning behind the show's plot. I really started to relate to the characters and zombies at this point and the show became much more interesting to me.

The lead actor is definitely the main character, but this show does a surprising amount of side-character development. The main character's story becomes mostly about uncovering the stories of other people until the last couple episodes and it's really fascinating to follow him along this process. In the end, once I had digested the entire show, every episode, and the full plot, I found it to be deeply meaningful and compelling. The plot threads are all pulled together end you end up with a masterpiece of storytelling.

Apart from the story, the visuals were really good in this show. The production values are extremely high quality. It's entertaining to watch, your eyes always have interesting things to look at even when the scenes slow down and there's less action. I'm really hopeful for another season of this since the story is more like a super hero origin story. I'd like to where the super hero goes from that origin point and how the wider world changes as the virus becomes more widely understood.

I haven't read the original webtoon so this comment is just going to be judging by this drama.
It was fast-paced, exciting, and pretty much true to the original. I didn't mind the changes they made. Since I didn't know what was going to happen next, it kept me on the edge of my seat.
Good plot. When I first watched it, I was making fun of the appearance of the monsters and then around episode 2 or 3 I got weirdly invested in the plot. It was great to see the warrior song used in the show.
strength point:
Nice staff (especially Lee Se Young gives such bad vibes which is a sight for sore eyes) “Sorry but his hair is funny to me.”
-Cool Characters: In many survival stories there are only a handful of characters who need to survive, but Sweet Home explores the story of about 20 characters and how they need to work together to survive (which is really refreshing). It was realistic in that most of the characters are incompetent (physically or psychologically) in a survival environment which makes it more difficult for the helpful few and themselves.
-An interesting place. It is an apartment building and the way they use their surroundings to survive is very original.
Sometimes characters die way too easy. And sometimes they survive impossible. Sometimes unpredictable and sometimes not.
All in all, I can't wait for next season.

Crazy asf, but in the good way of course.
As someone who read the Sweet Home webtoon, my expectations were VERY high and the show was able to meet my expectations and beyond. Even with the use of only one main setting (the apartment complex) there was so much going on. The multiple main characters really pulled the show together.

It was really nice seeing Song Kang play a character that wasn't involved in a romantic story line. I've only seen him play the jackass main lead (Love Alarm & Nevertheless lmao) but his character in Sweet Home was so much more. The relationships between the leads were very heart touching, seeing them become so close within a short amount of time. This made me become really attached to the characters.

It was kinda nostalgic seeing the Sweet Home live action since the webtoon was my childhood (I would read it constantly during elementary school lol). The CGI of the monsters in the first half of the show were more video game like, but it gave the show a unique touch. The soundtrack was really thrilling and the intense choral music really gave scenes the needed dramatic effect.

Most importantly the story was phenomenal! Like I mentioned earlier the multiple main characters was really what made the show memorable. Betrayal, death, surgery, love confessions...the list could go on. Who knew so much crazy stuff could go on in one apartment building during an apocalypse.

All of the characters have their charms and some are highly attractive. The latter may not be that important but maybe it will push people to watch the show. (....please give me your hand in marriage Lee Eun-yu....)

I will warn you that there is a A LOT OF BLOOD. You've seen the tags and my warning so don't expect just a couple scratches here and there. As someone who likes horror and gore it wasn't really a big problem for me but I know some are sensitive. I will say there were some punches and kicks I could literally feel through the screen and made my own body hurt lmao.

Anyways, I've been typing for too long so I'll just summarize and say that Sweet Home has a lot of story, a lot of blood, and you will definitely cry. It's a must watch ;)

(I CANT WAIT FOR S2!!!)

I knew that there was action but WOW. I felt every moment- every second, it was like i was playing with the actors
(I COULD PLAY A DEAD BODY AND I WOULD BE HAPPY)
◇The ost was perfect for the drama and ..... BewhY(k-rapper) you never disappoint♡
◇The acting was very good & the story was interesting
◇The only thing that i was not sure was the way they will make and show the 'monsters' like i was afraid if the monsters was too 'fake' but i was wrong.
You don't know how happy i was when i saw that the monsters look like monsters (it sounds funny but i hope you understand what i mean)
Then i realized that the production was amazing
And OF COURSE I RECCOMADED it !!!!!

Entertaining but lacking
Overall, a pretty entertaining show with some good visuals and action. Love the premise of the show, just wish it was executed differently. I haven't read the webtoon, so I'm reviewing solely the show itself.

First off, I agree with many other people who think that adding the Imagine Dragons song to dramatic scenes was a little unfitting to say the least. Ruined some of the dramatic moments, but still, not that big of a deal for me. My problem was with the way they develop Song Kang's character, Hyun-su.

I was under the impression that Hyun-su was going to be the main character and have a lot of scenes. Unfortunately, with such a large ensemble cast, he was often pushed to the side in order to focus on the other 10 main characters (not to mention the side character's screentime). They gave Hyun-su a very sad and dramatic backstory that looked like it was going to develop as the show progressed, allowing him to overcome his demons and possibly utilize it to help others. Although he does help others intermittently throughout the show, he rarely gets any satisfying scenes where he saves the others and is often the one who is needing saving in the first place. Most of the main cast were given strong characters who are capable and have their moments to showcase their strengths, whereas Hyun-su didn't really get any satisfying moments (except at the very end).

Even at the end of the show (spoiler warning), I was expecting Hyun-su to do something dramatic and possibly sacrifice himself to save the others, showing them that he was a good person even if he was labeled a ""monster"". This doesn't really happen, and his climactic ending moments are overshadowed with the ""sacrifice"" of the other main character, Eun-hyeok. Speaking of, I don't understand the need for Eun-hyeok to even sacrifice himself in the first place. He could of gone with the others to safety, but instead he decided to sit in a room and die for no reason? I don't know, maybe I'm missing something (I was often confused by the plot). This just overshadowed Hyun-su's part that could have been so much more impactful.

In general, that is my biggest complaint about this show. I understand the need to showcase all of the characters in this large cast, but I feel like they could have done so much more with Song Kang's character. There was so much potential to develop him into something great, like having him transform at the end and sacrifice himself to save the others as a clear indication of him accepting himself and having grown as a person, but instead he just leaves. Not really a sacrifice, no recognition or satisfying ending, and doesn't even get to prove to the others who judged him that he was truly a good person and could control his inner demons. Even the whole relationship between Hyun-su and Eun-yu could have been more impactful at the very end if they didn't unnecessarily throw in Eun-hyeok's death.

Overall, decent story with some hard to follow plot progression and plotholes, great acting, questionable music choices, good effects and animations, good action, but with the unrecognized potential of the character of Hyun-su.

A webtoon reader dream come true!
At first, when I watched the trailer to this drama, it caught me off guard since it's my first time seeing Korea taking on a thriller and horror story from a webtoon and make it into live-action. It intrigued me to watch it as it's something fresh for me. And boy was I blown away by it. Instead of getting the horror content that I was expecting, it gave me the CHARACTERS, STORY, PLOT, and FEELS. (and yes I won't give any spoilers in my reviews no worries)

Story/Plot:
It started with our main character going through some things that I can say some of the young adults do go through in high school. It's not something many people talk about and starting the story with such a character is right off the bat very different from the other stories I have watched. (Take note: I didn't read the webtoon but I know of its existence.) The high tension of the story immediately starts in the first episode, it brought me along the ride as the episodes progress. The pacing of the drama is just right, there are no moments in the drama that are just fillers or unnecessary. Each moment has meaning and it adds to the story! The logic and reality of the story are alright, not out of the blue but pretty understandable.

Character:
Besides the main character development throughout the story, the other characters are so good! I ended up loving a lot of the side characters. When you have a good story, good characters, what can go wrong? I enjoyed all the scenes of the other characters, it's heartwarming to see how the characters bond together in the situations they were put in. I won't say too much about the characters because by doing so I would have to dive into spoilers :') but really they are the highlights of the story for me.

Action:
The fighting sequence really blew me away! I did not expect high-quality visual effects. What happens if you fuse Korean drama and one of the Hollywood visual effects? SWEET HOME! It's just breathtaking to see the monsters in such well-produced CGI. Hands down to the people behind this production. The fighting sequences make me on the edge of my seat every time! Really well done on this part!

Overall:
Although the genre is considered thriller and horror, I see it more as a character-driven story. There were so many heartwarming moments between the characters and it made me connect with them more. The sad and funny parts with the characters are very memorable from this drama. I love the horror but these sides of the drama really were the ones that made me got hooked on it. Some warning for those weak-hearted souls out there, there will be some deaths in this drama that made me bawled my eyes out in the end.

So if you have read this long review till the end, might as well give this a try! It's a really good watch and thank you for reading this review as well hehe xD

A Homerun (pun intended)
Story: Monster epidemic that turns our desires into literal monstrosities (both malevolent and benevolent) sweeps Korea if not the rest of the world. A group of tenants are stranded in their building with danger lurking both inside and outside. As in every good zombie/similar story, it's all about human condition with monsters (of any kind) being the commentary on humans.

Acting: Impeccable. From children to seniors, everyone did a bang on job. Deaths hurt us because characters are so engaging and earned our care. It's hard to praise individuals when everyone gave it all. Also, male eye candy ahoy: Song Kang, Lee Do-hyun, Lee Jin-wook and very special mention MASSIVE SPOILER DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU Hyun'soo's transformation into winged monster/angel of death sooo hot OMG! SPOILER END

Music: I honestly don't remember. Some death metal?

Rewatch Value: High or even Mandatory. There are many things that are worth revisiting especially episodes 7 - 10 and a scene that I strongly recommend pausing and watching frame by frame to understand the twist . MASSIVE SPOILER AHEAD DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU The very last scene reveals the true identity of the Goo Monster who posses dead bodies. That's the rich student who bullied Hyung-Soo in highschool. I noticed that some fans didn't get this and only figured out that Goo possessed Sang-Wook's body but not who Goo really is. To prove that Goo is the Bully, I paused the scene showing how Goo came to be (the experiment scene) and played it frame by frame. It's the same actor who played the Bully. They deliberately keep his face in the shadows, but when you pause and study frames you'll see it's his hair and face. Also, he is the only one who knows that Hyun Soo's full name is Cha Hyun Soo. No one in the building calls him by his family name Cha, only by his given name Hyun Soo. SPOILER ENDS

Overall: After a somewhat rocky introduction, the drama picks up the steam from episode 4 and gets better and better with 7 - 10 being exceptional. It's a rollercoaster ride that will leave you emotionally drained and annoyed that you have to wait for Season 2 after THAT cliffhanger.

Less Emotional Connections To Make
The story was fine, actors are great, amazing setting of the whole show itself, manageable visual effects but something was off about the shallow characters for me. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't connect or even care for them! Maybe it was just me but because of this drawback, I wasn't able to appreciate the good in the drama! Had to discontinue.

They did touch a few sensitive subjects, a few emotional scenarios but they didn't have that 'punch in the gut' kind of effect on me. Only because I felt no sort of attachment with the characters, not even the main leads.

And then there's the messy direction halfway in the show. I had to literally play back the scenes to understand what actually happened. Some really important moments were rushed into and really damaged the vibe of the show for me.

The ost was amazing but like the majority of viewers, I too felt that it didn't always match the ongoing scene.

Much more could have been done with the wide array of pretty convincing actors but both the direction and the story didn't use them well.

SWEET HOME
I watched it all in few days. Each episode was so exciting that I had to look at the next one. The first thing I want to say is that this drama is probably not for everyone, but if you are into horrors, gore, blood and monsters you have to watch it!

The story was really interesting. I like that despite it was something between action horror mostly for me, it has also psychological meaning in all this. I appreciate it in movies and series, because I'm looking for hidden meaning behind almost everything. The topic itself (humans VS monsters) is great, again we can see here, that sometimes (or every time?) humans are the biggest monsters of all monsters. Still some scenes were a bit confusing, I would like to know more informations about how it works with the transformation. Anyway it's not just basic story about surviving, but also finding hope in dark times and life, connection between people, sacrifice, love and more, which is good to realize especially now in covid. And not gonna lie there were scenes that got me into tears.

I mean the acting was amazing, each character had unique story and you can definitely see big character development here. Song Kang is one of my favorite actors and it was nice to see him in different role type. He played Hyun Soo just perfect in my opinion, innocent and creepy at the same time. I could relate to his feelings so much through the whole series. Not just him, but all roles were handled very well, even those two little kids.

About music yeah I agree with others, that they can add some more songs than Warriors by Imagine Dragons. This one song was repeated and played most, it became a little annoying, still I think it fits the theme so well. So I didn't mind so much.

I rarely rewatch series, but after some time or with someone, I wouldn't mind at all watch it again.

CONCLUSION: If you like this genre, just go for it. I would highly recommend it, for me it was one of the best series of this year probably. In the end, I just said to myself ""wow I need a second season""!

Quite Heavy.
When it comes to Kdramas I usually don't watch these types of genre and I seriously don't know what drew me to Sweet Home but I'm so glad I watched it. I do not read Webtoons so my review would be solely based on an avid drama watcher. I went into Sweet Home with no expectations and the content of the drama seriously surprised me. It provided the right amount of story to get viewers hooked, the acting was great and some of the characters are well written and relatable. The characters were complex and we got to see a different side of everyone thus character development. I love the story it told and the metaphors embedded, it portrayed an in-depth look on human nature and battle against human's obsessive desires.

Some of the characters were completely useless and added nothing to the story. The sacrifices in the show are very questionable as they chose to sacrifice the brave ones all in all I guess I can say bold writing. In the first few episodes the CGI was at all not impressive and laughable at times but it got better as time went. The music at first was good and really added to the theme of the story but they kept repeating the same song which totally ruined some of the scenes for me. I believe for a genre of such they are several other songs that can go well. The drama has it flaws there are couple plot holes and some things could have been explained better but despite all that I was deeply satisfied.

A Sad, Violent Bop
I don't often watch survival horror/thriller/action shows like Sweet Home but when I do I know I'll always come out of it kicking and screaming and Right I Was.

I'd begun reading the webtoon of Sweet Home late last year but as it was ongoing at the time, I lost my reading momentum so I decided I'll wait for the webtoon to finish updating and then I'll just binge it. Unfortunately, I have the memory of a chimpanzee and never got back to finishing it so when I heard it was getting a drama adaptation, I told myself I'd finish the webtoon first—personal rule: consume OG material before adaptations—And Then I Didn't. So. Sweet Home was postponed indefinitely until I got my sh¡t together but then I found out Netflix had it dubbed in my native language, which is always a vibe, so I powered through it in a couple hours and well, was That an experience :D

Sweet Home replicated the foundation and basic premises of the webtoon but exercised some liberties with it including the addition of a new major character (unfortunately, at the expense of an original major character, who I personally love) and also altering the characterisation and relationship dynamics of the rest of the major cast (also unfortunately at the expense of the specific nuances of the original relationships of which I enjoy). However, removed from its original source, which is understandable, Sweet Home is a thoroughly fun watch on its own with impressive cinematography and suspenseful storytelling. Though I personally prefer most of the webtoon depictions, I found myself separately enjoying some of the new additions too.

Regardless of the changes, I thought that the storytelling, acting and cinematography still aligned very nicely to express the absolute devastation of the friendships and camaraderie formed between the characters (in the show) and with such poignance that I already know I will be reeling from the effects for days to come. I particularly enjoyed the use of small symbols/anecdotes to emphasise the nuances of these relationships (i.e. Jaeheon’s soju, Sangwook’s smoking) as well as the curt and simple but pensive conversations the characters have with one another—not enough to really picture the full story but definitely enough to feel the sentiments.

I, too, hold the opinion that the cast is an excellent match for their respective characters and I've genuinely enjoyed the whole cast’s immersive and emotive performances.

Sweet Home always struck me as a Thematic sort-of horror, reinforced by the webtoon's storytelling centered around an overall philosophical conundrum about people and being (humans, alive) and society, morals, etc etc., among other issues, rather than a Scary, Gory kind-of horror, so I'm more or less hand-wavy about the lack of, uh, scare factor(?). I think the fear lay more in one's investment towards the characters and their fates than the horror visual quality of the show.

[Also, it just struck me: “psychological thriller” could also be another genre you can chuck into the bunch]

Oh! One more thing: I loved the OST; I felt that the rock music theme made everything so fun and badass to watch, and while it does affect a less severe atmosphere compared to the webtoon, I found myself not minding the watered down narration (and characterisations) all that much, especially with consideration to the time limit in proportion to the extensively fleshed-out character development for every major character in canon—and also because the lack of a deep dive was compensated by the accelerated plot (not so much fast-paced but speedy enough). However, I do agree that it is a shame Hyeonsoo's character arc was significantly dialled down, especially since he is the main narrating character.

I'm also of the opinion that the CGI was impressive! Granted, I don't hold very strong attachments to visual effects, etc.; I think they're significant to the production quality, but I'm not too fussed about it in general, so I thought Sweet Home's CGI monsters was quite well done (it was HD—I have myopia so don’t quote me on that though—and it resembled the webtoon monsters, which was personally a delight so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

All in all, it was one hell of an emotional rollercoaster and I am, once again, a victim of crying migraines. Please do give it a watch if you're looking for a fun, gritty(ish), bloody survival horror/thriller/action/suspense/whatever with a (however watered down) character focus and a bop OST and cinematography. Forming attachments to the characters /will/ come back to bite you in the ass, viewer discretion advised.

No spoilers ahead, just an overall review of the series :)!

First of all, if you're going to watch this series then do prepare yourself for at least a couple heartbreaks.

Before watching this series I made sure to read the webtoon from beginning to end, which most likely affected my view on the adaptation. However, I truly loved this series.

There were many diferences that I could easily point out and that, at the beginning, weren't making much sense as to why did they change certain things. Yet those changes weren't made carelessly, those changes turned out to be the ones getting the series to be even more interesting and intriguing.

Everything was so intense and so shocking at the same time. The ups and downs were just what was needed and I can't even describe how much I overall loved this series.

The monsters weren't really that bad if I'm being honest. I was actually pretty amazed with them, I didn't thought they'd be able to bring them to life like they did, truly impressive.

The acting was just on point for me, I was't expeting much with this kind of 'live action' but I'm more than satisfied with the result. It also gave me the feeling that we may get some more in the future..who knows.

Something that also catched my attention was the soundtrack! I love every single theme and music of it. Just like the intro and outro themes and animations/illustrations were extremly pleasing to watch.

I hope whoever watches this series enjoys it.

I'll just say one last thing, take a look at the webtoon if you haven't already, its worth it :).

WEBTOON vs. Drama?
I personally loved the drama. It was absolutely *chef kiss*. The plot, characters, pairings, casting, it was all amazing. (I mean, except for the fact that the music didn't fit very well-) It's the kind of drama you just CANNOT get over. (I have rewatched it 4 times already) It's just... wow. I never expected to like it this much.

The webtoon was great too. The author did so well portraying every aspect of every character.

Which brings me to the question:
Sweet Home: WEBTOON vs Netflix Drama?

Well, first of all, the idea, of course is the same, same epidemic, same disease.

But the two differs a lot as well, they added and changed the roles of characters, and changed the pairings as well.

Overall, I think it's better that the drama is treated as a stand alone, since it's so different, (but still as amazing) as the WEBTOON.

Sweet Home is really unforgettable. It made me cry, laugh, scream, almost pee in my pants. It was a hell of a rollercoaster ride, and it was 100% worth it.

Just Wild
I did not know this was originally a web comic, but I saw something new on Netflix where all of the episodes were out at one time so I jumped on it. I had no expectations, but I was entertained the whole ride. With a relatively fast start, and a strong story throughout, I don't have many complaints. There was some jumping around with the story where things clicked after a couple of episodes, but I'd just say to watch it and give it a rating yourself. It's very gory. There is a lot of blood. If you're not good with that stuff, maybe choose another drama. But if you like action, monsters, and good characters, I'd say jump right into this without reading too much about it. I don't think I'd even read the web comic before this. Go in completely clueless. Happy watching!

COMING FROM THE WEBTOON

STORY
- I am actually quite disappointed. It steered its story quite far from the webtoon. FIRST OF ALL, A lot of the deaths we're very anticlimactic the only thing that got me somewhat emotional was Jayhun's death and that by its self was different from the webtoons. The granpa, Eun Hyuk and the convenience store's wife Sun Young's death we're quite meh or like ok it happened soooo..
- SECONDLY It didn't pack as much of an impact from the webtoons. Also not to mention that they did not get to develop the back stories of some of the characters. I mean sure you can say that they didn't have enough time due to having to compress the story by 10 eps BUT my big questionis then why add new characters? I mean you added new characters focused on their backstory like the Yi Kyung, Sang Wook and Seung-Jae or the rapist guy but couldn't focus on the actual existing characters' backstory? like Du Sik's? that screams BS to me.
- THIRD the story went all over the place? It was like a hot potato throwing you to all different scenes also a hefty amount of scenes was added I dare say I can going the scenes that actually originated fro the webtoon.
- FOURTH They tore the character relationships like why? and not the mention they changed the characters's attitude? Like why did you have to change it? At the same time not only did it cause a different relationship for them but it also altered the way that the characters were present/acted in the actual drama.

POSITIVES:
Casting and their acting is amazing tho. You can feel the emotion they wish to portray through their faces.

The choice of music is not fitting.
Overall the show is pretty good but I there were some parts of it that were not to my liking.

The acting was superb, I can feel the emotions that were portrayed by the actors and the actresses. And felt genuine hatred and annoyance for some of them.

The story I feel has a rather good meaning behind it. When people succumb to their desires, they lose their humanity and become monsters i.e. Luffy who wanted to reach his child, the store owner who was wearing a wig who probably wanted to grow hair, and Sonic who probably wanted to run faster than anyone while he was still a human.

The choice of music used in some scenes totally killed the mood for me and I feel didn't really fit the theme of this show. ""Warriors"" is the name of the soundtrack used on many occasions in this series. I myself have heard the soundtrack before through League of Legends and I get where they are coming from by inserting the sound track in certain scenes. The characters have to become ""warriors"" and fight to protect everyone. I feel that it is overly used to the point where their actions no longer seem brave/epic or whatever it should have felt. A particular scene was when Samurai Jack sacrificed himself by getting into the elevator with Grasscutter Ahjussi. I myself felt that that scene should have felt sad but the soundtrack ruined the mood for me.

CGI on some of the monsters just seemed so off. Boomer seemed like he was 3D while everything around him is 2D. Other than that, I don't really have any complains on the CGI.

The Gory Drama with a Heart
This is one of the better apocalyptic dramas out there. This heart-in-your-throat horror drama full of blood, gore and action delivers in strong performances by a talented ensemble of actors and strong writing. Think the cast of LOST meets #Alive.

Although the topic of humans turning into creatures/zombies has already been explored, this one is different, though the details of how this comes about is as murky as the bowels of the apartment complex, where much of the action takes place. What is not lost on the viewer, however, is the metaphor of humans treating each other like monsters when hurting each other due to hatred, envy, or a lack of empathy, and literally becoming the creatures of their deepest desires who feel the need to kill or save humans.

What I love the most about this drama are the strong female leads. No Mary Janes here. The women in this show young and old, kick butt. Not only are they caregivers, teachers, grocers, musicians, first responders, and moms, they are also extraordinarily fierce when pushed to the brink of danger. See Yi Kyung, played by the beautiful Lee Shi Young, could have easily been played by a man. The fact that they chose a female hero is a plus. She is strong, smart, and protective of the tenants in the apartment building. The audience is provided with backstories through flashbacks of the main characters to better understand their weaknesses, and how they overcome them through the ensuing action. Some strategically placed comedic elements serve to break up the tension when the drama becomes too intense to handle.

Now for the bad parts: It's over-the-top violent and gory. There is so much blood, body parts and dead people that I felt caught in a violent video game. If you can't stand blood and guts, this is not the show for you. Some story details were ambiguous. It's not exactly clear why humans are becoming the way they are. There are some clues that are not explained which leads me to believe there may be a second season, else these nuances would be considered plot holes. The cliffhanger ending? There has to be a second season or it would be the most ambiguous part of the drama after all that suffering.

Would I watch this again? Yes! I need to go back and catch the little things I missed due to the break-neck pace of the story. It is very thought-provoking drama because it makes you ponder the human psyche. The black on white line drawing of the eye at the opening credits along with the classical music is a stroke of genius. It draws you in and slams the door behind you,

Just amazing
I just finished watching this drama and the only word i have is that this drama is just amazing
I read some reviews and got to know that some viewers are not satisfied with this drama as it is bit different from the original webtoon
But as i have not watched webtoon this drama was just amazing
I really like how each characters have their own stories and they are not just some side characters who are supposed to die
One of the best thing of this drama is their story and how it unfold that is something that will keep u hook up to this drama because u just want to know what is happening which is a plus point
But yess i do want to add that it would have been soo much better if the monsters were humans itself that would have made it even more interesting
Now lets talk about their acting OMG that was amazing they will make u feel the intensity of the drama and ofcourse they will also make u cry so be ready to have a good cry session
Overall one of the best drama i have watched
Give it a try it is worth it

Literally amazing, I loved every second of it. I'm in love with apocalyptic stories, so this was perfect for me. I'm sad that there are so little episodes! I highly recommend watching this, or at least reading the webtoon!!!

Going into details (without spoilers):

- The acting was really good, I forgot I was watching television, though there were a few unnoticeable mistakes. (I'm a huge fan of Lee Do-hyun which is part of why I finished this show in a few hours).

- Loved the OST, it had an 'imagine dragons' song on it, which was perfect because they're music always sound like something made for an apocalypse.

- The plot either gets you really attached or thrown off completely, for me it was so interesting so I got hooked, the general idea I got from this show was to not judge anyone by how they look. The characters were usually nothing as they seemed.

- The CG's were pretty great, though noticeable for a few of the monsters.

- In case you are afraid, because you get frightened easily, watch it but with your pillow, teddy bear, or a partner. Personally it wasn't scary at all it just had you in suspense, or on the edge of your seat.

- Please support this show, it's great and everyone worked hard and did their best on it!

Why I suffer for k-dramas.
It had a really intersting storyline and was completely diferent from all the dramas I had ever seen.
The caracters had flaws and virtues and, on top of that, were experiencing the apocalipse. The problem here is that the monsters and special effects aren't what makes us scared. What really messes with our heads is that we get the actions they are forced to do and agree that we would do the same, no matter how vicious they seemed.
The only reason I gave it a low-ish rewatch value was because of how recently I had seen it. Totally worth it, though!

Finished it in two days
This show was a pleasant surprise to me as I went into it with no expectations, it completely drew me in and got me very attached to most of the characters even ones that were a bit morally ambiguous. Though the story is nothing extraordinary it's a character-based show that focuses mainly on the characters, how they develop and how their relationships change in the midst of the crisis they're facing and it does an excellent job a it.
Nevertheless it does have some flaws, notably the CG which I honestly found quite janky, the monsters looked very irrealistic which threw me off at times especially in the beginning. Not only the monsters but also some basic things like fire and the snow looked very fake which I assume was a budget issue, hopefully the second season gets invested in more. Also, some events seemed rushed but that's usually what happens with webtoon adaptations since you can't fit everything in a limited number of episodes. Overall, I'd say it's a very good show and I highly recommend it, I'll probably be reading the webtoon now.

It took me some episodes to really get into the history, the progress on the real interesting things were kinda lazy. Talking about ost's, the song ""warriors"" always got me off guard, like, who thought that it would be a good idea? and repeat it more than once. The first scene wit eun hyunk using a fire extinguisher and playing this song I was like ""what am I watching?"". The CGI of the monsters annoyed me at the begging but they're really good for a tv show. The history in general after 3 episodes started to get my attention and the final epispde hyped me a little bit, overall it was a good show, I enjoyed the trama and some characters.

Eh Turned Ah
I'm not sure how I stumbled on this drama but I went with it and wasn't too disappointed. It was nice to see quite a few familiar faces and everyone's acting was pretty spot on. I felt quite a few emotions throughout and I always like being able to imagine myself in these kind of situations lol It was refreshing to see something about monsters that wasn't zombies HOWEVER... I was kinda upset in some areas. As long as you can get past the horrible CGI and off-brand Silent Hill monsters, this can be a really beast mode show. As creepy as they were I feel they could've been created a bit better. Character development was a little off/slow, if they got any at all, and the same goes for the back ground stories. Overall it's a pretty suspenseful drama with plenty of blood, weapons and death.(what more could you ask for?) I found myself quite frequently lying to myself with the infamous line of ""just one more episode"". lmao

P.S. I loved the Tokyo Ghoul style ""final form"" in the end
Enjoy...

First of all, Sweet Home has such good cinematography and special effects. The actors did a great job in this. I especially loved Song Kang's (Hyun-soo) acting in this. I haven't seen anything else that he's been in, but, he did exceptionally well here. The relationships and the character development was also really good. I thank the rest of the cast for the great acting as well. Some of the music didn't fit well with the scenes and felt very out of place. The CGI monsters were not that bad and some of them were good, for example the monster with the tongue thing. Some of the other monsters weren't done so good, but, they weren'tso bad either. Overall, I really like this drama and reccomend it if you like psychological horrors and thrillers.

Solid survival drama, song kang is love
As kdrama-land hypes for this show, please don't mind me here on the side hyping for Song Kang! He has a magnetic presence on screen, and he made me feel for the trials of the conflicted male hero Hyun Su. Even though I find the storytelling pacing a bit off, esp. in the earlier episodes, it does get its stride in the 2nd half.

This is a solid entry in the 'zombie' survival suspense genre in the trend of Train to Busan and Kingdom. For me, it's not that scary per se but be warned there are some scenes that are uncomfortable to watch, and trigerring content like suicide, bullying, child abuse, violence and a lot of gore as the show tackles the dark side of the human soul, and the everyday struggle with ourselves to be better than our darkest desires.
But the show does balance all that with hope, community, sacrifice, and perseverance.

Such a solid cast with a mix of both upcoming and veteran actors, and I love the ladies esp. Lee Shi Young, our badass firefighter. There's a disconcerting feeling watching such a timely dystopian drama, now we're living in a world with covid, while Sweet Home tackles infections, human evolution and survival. What used to be only escapism entertainment before, now hits a little bit closer to home. Unfortunately, as Netflix shows are, this is not a standalone story, there will be a s2, but more Song Kang to love so I can't complain much.

Haunting
This series was phenomenal! It was haunting, dark, terrifying, heartbreaking, and hopeful. The actors/actresses in this series did an amazing job. The special effects are off the charts, and some of the best I’ve ever seen! It felt like I was playing Resident Evil! I don’t want to give any spoilers, but it was epic. The story is hauntingly beautiful, and will crawl into your soul, and it won’t leave. I love gory horror, and this show did NOT disappoint! I was on the edge of my seat the majority of the time. I felt a deep connection to the characters, especially Cha Hyun Soo. He is such a tormented, lonely character, and he deserves all of the awards for his performance in this series. Seriously! If you haven’t watched it, watch now!!! It’s on Netflix, and you definitely won’t regret it!

i'm crying
objectively, this drama is really good.... if you haven't read the webtoon beforehand.

the acting is amazing (i am still not over the fact that they casted lee do-hyun as hyuk, whoever decided on this ??? may god bless you, your family and you holy cow because ???? i'm ascending right now), the music is on point and ??? the plot line is cool as well, even though a little predictable... and completely different from the webtoon, i feel like (i watched this with a friend and we both agree on this)

i'm honestly a little upset because they RUINED some characters (wook, daddy, they really did you dirty i'm sorry) or some scenes and as i said the story ??? is different ???? and i'm kinda mad about it because the moral and the reflection behind the 'monsterification' in the webtoon is a lot more beautiful, albeit more abstract, i feel like — if i went into the drama without having read the webtoon, i probably would have enjoyed it a lot more, though, which is why i still rated it with a 7/10

if you liked the drama and haven't checked out the original, i'm begging you to please, please go check it out, it's a masterpiece !!

I would definitely recommend you to watch this series
-In the the first episode I was blown away.I do have to say in advance, there's a lot of blood. So, if you don't like stuff like that just look out for that.
-Every episode has something interesting to keep you watching.
-There's only 10 episodes so it's not long.
-It ended with a cliffhanger and there is said to be a renewal for season 2 but don't let that hold you back the story is pretty good and the way it all played was even better.
-The actors played the characters very well.
-If you think this is a waste of time, don't say anything because this is not a waste,I promise.
-I do have to say this series is different from any other horror Korean dramas I've ever watched before.Although this is the first time I've watched one like this,I can say it sure made a mark in my memory.

ALSO YOU CAN WATCH IT ON NETFLIX,AND DRAMACOOL
I hope you watch and enjoy it

I prefer the original ver of webtoon
As a fan of this webtoon my expectation on this was quite high. I love how the writer put so much character development in each characters. Tbh, this series was fine, my expectation quite fulfilled. But the ending just, hm, not as expected. Webtoon's ending was fine I think it will do to put it in the live action, but why change it?. Also, the backsound of Warriors is seriously annoying, too much ugh, it still linger. But other than that I think it was fine, they still got the plot, and the cgi was okay too.

Almost the Best, but...
I believe there are a lot of reviews explaining the good parts of the drama. So, I'm here to give you some points about which one is lacking.


- Firstly, it really reminds me of Attack on Titan, where it starts from fighting with the monsters and somehow it becomes fighting with humans.
- The first half of the drama is about defending and surviving in a world that has been occupied by monsters. The second half, however, is about fighting with a large group of robbers that came out from somewhere.
- At the very end of the drama, it tells you about escaping from military forces.


- The monsters are overpowered. The drama itself tells us that there's no way humans can defeat them.
- The monsters are occupying the whole country. It means there is a fvkcin lot of them.
- So, where are the monsters in the second half of the drama? THEY ARE GONE. The drama won't tell you where are they, how were they be killed, who are their killers, etc. Even that iconic long-tongued monster is gone.
- Although the drama tells us so, humans can defeat the monsters by burning them.


You are enjoying watching: humans surviving in a world of monsters and humans fighting against monsters.
You are deadly curious about how will they defeat all those monsters.
You are binge-watching the drama to see how the drama ends.
BUT, HAHAHAHA, out of nowhere there are robbery attacks. You no longer see the monsters.
Why it's ""out of nowhere""? The drama doesn't tell you about the robbers at all before.


What happens with Ahjumma in the toilet next?
If the infected ones can recover from their wounds, why can a weapon maker Ahjussi die?
The drama doesn't tell us about infected ones can get out from a body (shell) to find a new body.

Conclusion (negative part only):
This drama is lacking consistency. They replace the monsters' attack (which is the drama's main value) with robbery and military.

Probably, these questions will be answered in season 2?

Still, the drama is so intense that you barely see what flops. Not going to lie, the actions and intense atmosphere are SO GOOD that IT FEELS LIKE WATCHING A 10 HOUR HOLLYWOOD HIT MOVIE.

Promising and popular, but can be slow at times
I started Sweet Home after hearing how popular it is and my friends' recommending it. I loved how different each monster was and the CG of how real it looked. The story is also quite unique as it does go into the depth of each of the character's personality and backstory.

However, I wish that they answered more of the questions around ""why?"". I felt like I was confused most of the time in the drama and some episodes can be quite slow. The pacing is quite odd as it starts off with a great concept and then slows down until the last 2 episodes.

Still, the acting was really solid and so was that soundtrack, especially when a monster approached. I might check out the webtoon too.

Dont have ending
Wow actually i like it.. monsters r not too much scary but story really gives us thrilling and confusing.. but i feel like drama was dropping after 5 6 th episodes. (Its like mass runner firstly give us really thrilling feeling and after tht itz turn) i really dont like episode 9 i think human comes and kill things r not nessasary.. how ever it really show us worst is not monsters but human.. and there r few parts not show us wht is going on like that red shirt old man try to find somthing on ground tht time her daughter or somthing come and fell but he did nt notised,, and weelchair man turn wht hapnd to him that time those parts not clear..
And ys at the end is really turning we dont know whts going on i think tht becoz they are going to get season 2.. actually i want believe 2nd seson also will be good like first episodes in this one. I feel like itz gonna be like maze runner, and penizula(In maze runner they show us there r some kind of animals and runners go and find escape but end it will show they are not real animals and it getting more and more fake and penizula also show us human fight than zombi so i dont like them) i think of it in here becoz at first they show us lot of monsters and peopl fight etc etc and then human envolved it become human and human fight than monster tht why i rememberd maze runner and penizula

As for acting all have superb acting even kids.. i dont hve much say becoz there are exellent

Overall good drama but there are no end it ending confusing us. there will be 2nd season.

Really good if you stop comparing
This show was a wonderful watch, it was exciting, nervewrecking, and heartwarming at times. I've been a fan of the webtoon since it's early episodes and have been reading and following along until it's end. Obviously as a reader of the original comic, you will naturally compare. But after hearing that this series adaptation would not follow the plot of the webtoon dot by dot, I tried my best to watch it and enjoy it as a separate thing. The webtoon was not finished as the series was filming, so it makes sense why they would change up some things. If you stop comparing every scene with the webtoon, you will enjoy this show much more. Trust me on this.

Now for the actual review of the show. Sweet Home was ambitious. The CGI lacks at points (the blood of the monsters being what irked me the most), but it wasn't bad. The movements and colouring were well done, they were pretty seemlessly placed into this world. At times it looked like a video game (the protein monster as well as the one missing the top of its head) but that somehow added to the suspense. It felt like you were the one killing these monsters, as if you were playing a game. At other parts, the CGI looked so real. The wings in the last episode were breathtaking, the womb was heartbreaking. Overall, despite the CGI not being fully consistent in it's animation, it still looked really good. The acting was amazing. I've known of a good handful of these actors from their previous work, so I have nothing bad to say about it. They did an amazing job as usual. The editing was a mixture. For the most part, the cuts were well timed and the plot and timeline were easy to follow BUT there were also times, where some of the cuts were questionable. Twice did they zoom into Hyunsoo's face rather dramatically, only to cut it over to a whole different scene. In all honesty, that made me chuckle, it was a really awkward editing decision. In episode 3 or 4, where Han Dusik, was moved to the ground floor, there the editing and pace was too fast. He had earlier gestured how he wasn't able to get downstairs due to being on a wheelchair, and suddenly he did it with ease? They could've at least had shown the process. They did mention in a dialogue later on, that it was due to using the elevator, but I feel like they could've been more explicit about it. It ruined the purpose of him being stuck in his room for so long. Another thing, which I believe could've been shown more too, was how they trapped all the monsters. In the latter half of the series, they seem to easily roam around the upper floors. Somehow all the monsters are gone. They briefly showcased it in the first half, but it could've been more detailed, so that it didn't seem like all monsters vanished overnight.

Despite some flaws in editing and pacing, Sweet Home is overall a wonderful show. And with an ending like so, I can only wish for a season 2. (and also an adaptation for Bastard, please)

BEST DRAMA
Can I just say that I loved this drama just as much as I loved Extracurricular and I couldn't even bring myself to put it down. I had never heard of it, but my friend asked if I wanted to watch it with her because she had already watched it. And then we ended up binging the whole drama that day with no breaks in between each episode. I'm not a fan of horror—not because it's not interesting, but because I get scared very easily—and this drama was quite scary, but I loved it to bits.

My heart ached for Hyun Soo, but I love the way his character had developed—how he went from being alone and suicidal to fighting for his survival and having people by his side who he could trust and call his friends. It did take a bit of time to get there, considering the people around him refused to trust him at first due to Hyun Soo having a monster living and growing inside of him, but once they realized that Hyun Soo was on their side, they trusted him and fought alongside him.

Honestly, I actually thought the gangster or contract killer would be the first to be cursed because of how he made his first appearance—nonchalant and a dark gaze. I also thought he couldn't be trusted due to how he had a hostage at the start, but once I realized there was something up with the hostage, I began to understand. I also saw how he never harmed anyone else, and once he'd gotten rid of the murderer he'd kept hostage, it made way for a caring and soft-hearted man who fought to protect people and save double, or quadruple, the number of lives he'd taken. When he'd died, I was so heartbroken, but he'd died saving a life and being there for her during her last breath.

It also made me laugh—which I shouldn't have because there were people dying—that every couple that was building chemistry and could've ended up together... was incapable of dating because either one of them or both of them died. The director really said, ""No romance for this :D.""

But yes, this drama has my whole heart and now if you'll excuse me, I'll return to watching Sweet Home cast interviews and crying over them because I miss the drama already.

Good Enough
Korean Drama 'Sweet Home' has awful CGI, but it makes up with the on-point atmosphere. The settings, the costumes, the music, the performances, everything is and feels perfect, as the group of residence is trying to survive. However, this season felt more like the introduction, as we start to get to know each character and bond with them, without, nevertheless, getting too deep into the mystery of what is happening and why and how to move forward. Still, this season sets strong foundations for those to come.

In addition, everything is well constructed, with enough screen time for each character and each storyline. The pace is also perfect for the action element of the story. Finally, the performances were all quite emotional.

So, overall, 7 out of 10.

Every death hurts
I started watching because the cast guested on Running Man and finished it in one sitting. The script isn't as good as I expected it to be and there were times when I had to look up stuff because it wasn't explained properly but what made it worth watching until the end was the cast... The entire cast is S T E L L A R. They were so good that I ended up rooting for every single one of them... and every death pained me in ways I didn't imagine (especially ""that"" man who was warm and kind and understanding... he was decent and consistent throughout so it hurt me alot). I was also taken by surprise when I saw Kim Sung-cheol (my Prison Playbook babies reunited ♥)!! I will be looking forward to the second season because I now have so many questions that I want answers to lol

Humans are the scariest of all...
Disclaimer: I have not read the webtoon so this is an unbiased review of the drama as a standalone piece. Also, TW's for excessive blood and gore.

This is definitely an apocalyptic go-to, and one that integrates monsters and some deep questions very well. We start in a seemingly normal-ish (heavy on the ish) apartment complex with an introduction to all the central characters. It's a relatively easy drama to follow as the group we get to know is small and each introduction is integral to the story. At only ten episodes, every minute counted here. The acting is incredibly on point, and I really believe that is what brought the story to life.

The CGI in SH leaves much to be desired, many of the monsters coming off as almost laughable, but everything else was spot on. The OST was perfect for this and is definitely one I will be coming back to. My biggest complaint would be the length of this, as we don't get to explore the various backgrounds, and we only got to skim the surface of motivations for each character. The episode count sadly limited how in depth the plotline was, and I wish we had dived deeper into the story that was Sweet Home. However, each person was interesting and played an important part in SH. I don't think there was an actor who fell behind or let someone else outshine them, and that doesn't happen to often. Although there were ghost ships, there is no prominent romance here, which is a relief because there's enough going on everywhere else. It would have only detracted from the story time. Also, shout out to all the badass women characters in here. They really held their own and I appreciated everything they contributed to the story. In its essence SH puts forth many questions about what makes us human, our deepest desires, and what would kill our humanity. It was executed well and never posed a dull moment.

All in all, a phenomenal drama in an us versus them scenario that questions if we're our own monsters in the making. I would recommend if you're looking for something more serious but weirdly wholesome. I'm already hoping and ready for a season two.

I was scared that I was going to overhype this drama myself, so I waited a little while before watching it. But I gave in and decided that I really needed to start watching dramas that I really want to watch and this one did not disappoint. If you like the intensity of The Last of Us & The Promised Neverland, where you are trying to fight to stay alive, then this is for you. But there is also the intensity of your favorite characters dying like season one of Attack on Titan. Still, an amazing drama that makes you want to keep watching, but super depressing because all you want is the best for everyone and for them to be badasses and survive. But also, the reason why I couldn't give this a full 10 stars. Loved this drama, but it got to a point where I got annoyed that people were dying left and right, and mostly the ones I got attached to.

This was a drama about the ugliness of human nature as well as the bits of good - you have an apartment full of different people who are battling their own evils, and they are trapped together during a pandemic, trying to find some kind of synergy on how to survive together. You have people with a lot of character development and you even get to see some backstory on a few people, which made it a lot harder when you weren't sure if they were going to survive. I would say my favorite part about this drama, besides everything about Cha Hyun Soo, were the character teams. It seemed that a lot of people seemed to tag team together and build this emotional attachment that gave the drama life. Yoon Ji Su & Jayhun (or guitar baddie & katana Christian - so many people, couldn't keep up with names, had to give them nicknames) were the freaken dream team and became my favorite characters seeing how they grew together. Then near the end, we got Pyeon Sang Wook & Park Yu Ri (mafia & caretaker) who softened one another but still kicked major ass. There were other characters here and there that I tried to keep track of but Lee Eun Yoo, Seo Yi Kyung, & Lee Eun Hyuk were the three I couldn't figure out. Eun Yoo & Eun Hyuk had really cute sibling-building moments, but they were both just very extreme people. Yi Kyung is a fan favorite from the articles that I have read, and she was a badass, BUT I really never knew what her morals were in comparison with her end goal of trying to figure out what happened to her fiance.

Overall, I am excited to see a season 2 come out and even might decide to pick up the webtoon/manga. With the ending we got, I really want to figure who was really in that car and if it is possible for people to fight this ""plague.""

this is the new level monster story
From the rotten fish scene, I knew this one would be interesting.
The monsters are scary and yet your eyes fixed on the amazing details that they have done. They are even beautiful to watch in a way.
Korean drama has raised the bar again because this is not just a simple fighting and running away from monsters kind of movie but with lots of human elements which make the story much more meaningful and impactful (like Train to Busan).
There is not a second to be bored and you will finish it in a day.

Is it a good show? Maybe. But something is off.
First of all, english isn't my mother language, but i hope everyone at least know what I mean. I think nowadays, almost all tv shows which have good ratings, just part of hype, in fact not all of them is really good. After watching 2 ep, this show is pure action, and i quickly noticed something is off, which is, the logical action of the character based on situation. Enter Lee eun-hyuk. This guy shares a room with his sister. One night, he told her he was going to work. At ground level, he found some occupants grouping together & they seem can't get out. Then a monster attack. Tell me, in your logic, what should the guy do? First he tries to help others to fend off the monster & close the door. Pretty logical. Then he groups up with other. He forbids anyone opening the door to leave. Ok. He goes to security room and watches the monitors. He sits there with others & planning what to do. Errr...wait, did you say he has a sister?
Yep, that's exactly why i told you something is off with this tv show. The character doesn't act logically enough. Does he forget he has a sister up there? And when her sister finally goes downfloor, he just hands her a shirt for cover. No talk. Nothing.

Since I'm a person who's a fan of the original webtoon and I just can't help comparing adaptions from its original work. You are going to see me do that in this review. I mean if you are making an adaption of anything, it's expected that you'd get compared.

So, Not gonna lie, this is actually a pretty good adaption. The thing I loved the most about it is casting choices and the CGI. The cast looks exactly like the ones in the webtoon and if they didn't, they made them look similar but great make-up and while the CGI was hated by a lot of people and I can see why, I still loved it becuase literally every monster looks just like it looked in the webtoon! The CGI isn't used to make the monsters look realistic, it's used to make them look how they were in the original webtoon and props to them cuz they really did well! They are supposed to be unrealistic and sometimes funny!

Another thing that is pretty good about it is that it stays true to the original content to some extent. Yes they have changed a few important things but they still followed the original work quite well. I've seen a LOT of adaptions of my favourite original work, be it a book, webtoon, manga etc etc and most of the adaptions disappointed me but this one didn't. The changes were forgivable in my opinion.

What I did not liked though is that some characters are definitely written and shown differently to the audience than the webtoon. The webtoon goes VERY deep into the psychology of it all and although the drama does that too but it's not as deep as the webtoon and more feels like a normal zombie apocalypse thingy.

Now let's talk about the acting, it was good enough but definitely not mind-blowing. I was expecting song Kang to give me those bad boy vibes who was done wrong by society but they showed him as innocent and a victim since the beginning which took away the fun and enjoyment of it all . Seeing him grow as a person. Although again they did show some of it but the sane depth wasn't there. Song Kang's acting again was good enough. Not bad at all but definitely not super impressive and honestly I feel that about everyone here.

It's actually a good drama if you dobt compare since it has good depth in characters with grear psychological insights but still not as awesome as the webtoon.

Background music was actually good for every situation they were but nothing memorable.

Rewatch value ? Watching the whole drama was re-watching the story for me so I'm definitely not gonna re-watch it lmao

Ok, so in conclusion, if you haven't read the webtoon and enjoy gory things with psychological elements then this is definitely for you!

If you have read the webtoon then you may not enjoy it much but it's still good.

Is it scary ? If you can't watch gory things then don't watch it. Other than that its good. It's not necessarily scary but definitely a lot of blood lmao

Enjoy watching! Thanks for reading my review!

Vagabond is one of the best action Korean series that I've watched. It is also a must-watched series because its Lee Seung Gi and Suzy Bae's comeback team up in a series. Vagabond is full of action and has a very unpredictable scenes you will definitely get shocked with it's twists.
You will get impressed on how Cha Dal Geon managed all his near death situations just to find justice on his nephew's death.
am not that satisfied with the ending because I wanted to get rid os Samael and what happennto to story of Cha Dal Geon and Go Hae Ri???

Its been a while for me didn't watch a Korean series, and vagabond makes me come back to watching drama series. For me, this series was the definition of amazing drama, the story, plot, cinematography, and the acting was good. I want to say thank you for the director of this series, who already doing a great job as a vagabond director and make this amazing drama, appreciate his behind the scenes work. In the near future, I wish the Korean movie industry can make another amazing series like this, not only focus on their signature ""romantic comedy"" drama.

This one is difficult to review, because I really enjoyed the show tremendously and would have otherwise been rating it very highly - but its following the US show trend of purposefully NOT ending, to keep you hanging for a second season, which isn't actually promised anywhere.

So - if you start to watch this BEFORE there is a season 2, please be aware that this story is INCOMPLETE, it's not simply a case of ""bad ending"", it's unfinished. For me, that's entirely unacceptable and the main reason I quit watching western shows entirely.

Putting that to one side, I feel it's only fair to talk about the show that IS there as well.

The easiest analogy for this show in US shows is ""24"" - top grade action, lots of shoot outs, lots of explosions, lots of car chases, some amazing parkour along the roof tops and some great effects. I thought it was overall quite well executed and disagree with the comments that Suzy was poor - I thought she was spot on for the character she was playing (though perhaps she's portrayed as much more ""bad ass"" in the publicity, in the show she's much more of a rookie).

Lee Seung Gi plays a great role as the main character, the completely (and probably unreasonably :) ) unstoppable stuntman who can do just about anything - hey, this is meant to be sensational fiction so just kick back and enjoy it, it's great fun. He does a fantastic job.

Moon Jung Hee as the leading evil lady, Jessica, brilliant - her character drips with greed and nastiness perfectly and was fun to see her on-screen plotting counter-moves.

As with all these kinds of action shows, there are going to be plenty of times where you think ""wait, wasn't he just stabbed in the leg and now he's running?"" but shrug it off, if you want to look into things that closely you're probably not a fan of the genre anyway :) It's silly, it's fun and it's entertaining.

Production values are sky high, it's got a top top end movie feel to it all the way through.

The story does get a little bit tiring with the constant twists and turns but it all made sense as the story unfolds itself multiple times, it definitely keeps you on your toes.

In short, really enjoyed it right up until they left it without any ending, and there's no real hint that there's actually going to be a season 2 yet even. I *may* be a little grumpy about this.... but i've tried to separate my feelings on that topic from the rest of the show :)

I saw many comments and on other sites reviews that were all negative and that genuinely made me realise I shouldn't listen to others views on dramas again, I understand different preferences but this was genuinely amazing. I wanted to watch this when it first came out but I was frown off by all the feedback it received. Suzy's reactions were sometimes delayed but her acting was the best it's ever been in this. I'm so glad she got casted. All the actors were amazing. The story line = perfect. I don't usually give good reviews but this drama really deserved it.

Vagabond is a blockbuster drama with top notch action, cinematography, and music. LSG's role was practically written for him. Plotwise, nothing really pulled me in though. It's hard to believe it was written by the same writers as Empress Ki and History of Salaryman. This plot was so ridiculously unbelievable. The male lead is some random guy that somehow gets involved with the NIS and THEY JUST LET HIM HANG AROUND because they are so incompetent. I hated 90% of the characters. It's a very westernized drama that is probably better suited for a movie format than it is for a drama. I liked the second half of the drama better than the first and I think that's because ""Vagabond"" comes more into play.

Believe it or not conspiracy dramas have their tropes too and this was a whole bunch of them thrown in together. Some parts of the plot and acting were very corny. Some of the characters were very cookie cutter villain. You only have to watch a couple of these types of dramas to figure out who the real mastermind is. If this is your first conspiracy drama, you'll probably love it. If it is not, you'll probably find the plot mediocre.

The early part of the series was like meh, the story was somewhat great, feels like i won't continue the whole series at all; but if you really give the series a chance to watch it all you'll find yourself getting hook on how the story goes. Some episode has that cliffhanger especially at Episode 16. Fuck I already need to watch the 2nd season based on what the ending of the first season has been. And also this series shows that how the inner part of a government really is corrupt.

It's really interesting to write something about lobbyist, corruption and selling of weapons to the government body because this is actually happening in the real world. A lot of car brands and aircraft companies actually manufacture weapons and they often compete to bid for the contract. Besides military supplies, there are a lot of things that the government needs which require the same bidding process. Yet in this process, there is such bribery and corruption taking place. I am surprised that the screenwriter actually know such sensitive information. This drama has portrayed an exaggerated version of reality with all the plot to kill competitors. The action scenes are really good, almost comparable to Hollywood movies. However, there were way too many plot twists (Jessical initially being portrayed as the culprit, then decided to mislead the audience that it was the president, then decided to change the culprit to the prime minister and in the end, they made Edward the mastermind.) that it actually didn't make sense any more. The plot is weak because of the multiple plot twists. If there isn't any season 2, they just spent way too many episodes filming multiple plot twists that they didn't have time for a proper ending. If you rewatch it, there are way too many plot holes.

The idea of the story is great, the action scenes and filming location justify its high budget. But sorry, the plot is very weak with way too many bullshit plot twists that didn't make any sense anymore. Nevertheless, I still highly recommend this drama if you are sick of typical Romcom Kdramas and want something new.

I went into this show for Suzy and Seung Gi. I stayed for the endgame and the awesome characters and also the few but still amazingly cute Hae Ri/Dal Geon moments.

Soooo PLOT:

If you need A LOT of romance - which I usually do - you will not get that. However, the few glimpses of it are truly pure and cavity inducing sweet. Which is where I live and it was enough for me.

I really like the pace of this show and the way information is delivered. A lot of dramas in this genre tend to dumb down the plot, which I don’t mind but at the same time it’s kind of like okay… I see where this is going lets just skiiiiiiim. With this drama, you kind of always have a sense of distrust of the characters because there’s always just something not clicking? Which is awesome, because you know something is off but you don’t see the endgame. Honestly, the fact that I came back and finished this is the reason I gave such a high rating. I very rarely am able to stick to dramas in this genre all the way to the end.

On to CHARACTERS.

Dal Geon and Hae Ri. Love them, typical lovable core leads. Tae Woong was honestly the most stale for me? I adore Shin Sung Rok but nothing about the character written to pop? He was just kinda there. Hanging out, doing this second lead thing helping to move the plot along. I did however see a lot of people had an issue with Hae Ri’s character I guess? But honestly watching the show, I didn’t see the problem? She’s supposed to be stumbling, earnest and making mistakes. She’s a rookie. And this just sets the foundation I think, it’s to provide us with the contrast for her growth in HOPEFULLY the next season. I think the writers did an amazing job setting up these characters to show their growth. That’s what I enjoy about good dramas, I don’t want perfect characters that know everything and are just Mary Sue clones and on the other hand I don’t want constantly bumbling ‘weak’ characters that need to be saved by dumb luck.

JESSICAAAAAAAAAA - girl. You my new favorite. I wanna be you.

Lilyyyyy love of my life. Badass with a sort of moral code. KIM DO SOO can the both of you just like get together and have a spin off of assassins in love.

IN CONCLUSION. Please watch it because I thought it was wild and I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope you do too.

"" Vagabond "" was action packed, but had some parts of it that it wasn't that good.

The drama started strongly, with two emotional episodes that shoot the interest high with the whole action and mystery plot. The action continued till the very end, but the mystery was pretty much solved or got uninteresting half way through. So, the rest of the drama was just an extremely thinly spread plot that was left open in the end, probalby suggesting a second season ( ? ? ). The romance, in addition, was just unecessary. The couple had not one moment together and the whole thing looked forced. The performances, however, were pretty good.

So, overall, six out of ten.

This drama isn't the kinda typical Korean drama you see everyday, this is actually different in a unique kinda way. Its story is based on true facts happening in the real world in terms of government policies, corrupt bloody acts of the government and how negatively it impacts on the lives of the citizens.
This drama deserves its praise for a high production quality and intense action scenes (quite comparable to Hollywood i must say). Great castes and impeccable acting. High emotional and nerve wrecking scenes.
Its filled with complicated plot twists, that were really annoying and got me racking my brain. That only made the drama more intriguing and entertaining. I enjoyed it! The romantic scenes between the two leads were really funny and lovely, my face hurts from all the smiles I flashed anytime they bring up the romantic feels, but most of all top notched action scenes, that really got me tensed and kept me at the edge of my seat at all times.
For a drama being entirely pre-produced, i'm really mind blown. I mean Korea rarely take the risks of pre-produced dramas being aired, at the risk of not satisfying the viewers. But this drama is so so good.
The fight for justice and power in this drama is just so balanced, can't be explained in words.
I must credit the male lead too, NO ONE COULD HAVE DONE JUSTICE TO CHA DAL GEON'S CHARACTER LIKE LEE SEUNG GI DID! His acting was on another level, very much different from all Korean actors I have watched act, his emotions were right on point. Honestly, i became a big fan of him after seeing him act in this drama, he is such a good actor, I was so impressed.
This drama probably declined in its rating due to its ending and the minor setbacks it had while the airing kept being postponed, its not like dramas like this give the feels of a happy ending.
Overall, my word for this drama is PHENOMENAL! 9.8/10????

Please be warned! This ending will NOT leave you satisfied

It will make you question why you spent 16 hours watching a beautifully crafted show end so abruptly.

The ending made no sense, and given that it seems there will not be a season 2 (at least in the foreseeable future), the ending was extremely poor. They should have just ended the show after 13-14 episodes when things were going good. The ending was not even in keeping with the tone of the rest of the show. It came out of the blue, knocked you off your senses, mocked you for leaving you unsatisfied, and disappeared into the oblivion.

shitty ending, unrealistic plot progression
the action is very well done but a few things about this series put a bad taste in my mouth. so much of the police/investigative work feels like it was written by people who never actually researched how these things operate, (unless the standard is different in SK). i can't count how many times i rolled my eyes at or laughed at or wanted to skip through scenes where the plot was thoroughly unconvincing because of this. whenever a series does that, it just pulls me out of the story and makes me focus on more technical aspects. secondly, too much of the plots' progress was due to happenstance. while it did have good writing in there, ultimately, the ""conveniently finding an answer to this problem that doesn't really make much sense in the bigger picture"" got in the way of my ability to enjoy the series. there's also a lot of weirdly placed english in there and being a native english speaker, it was a bit hard to take seriously. but the final straw was the ending. it felt so detached and the lead up was very choppily sewn together. the only thing that would make me see this as slightly less of a problem is if the series gets a second season, otherwise, it's a very poor ending to an interesting premise. the acting was pretty great, nonetheless. and the music was very moving at parts. but all in all, good, suspenseful action isn't enough for me to give this a higher rating. perhaps these things aren't things that bother you too much, so watch for yourself and judge.

The writing is predictable and the twists aren't that shocking, if there's one thing that must be changed about this is the writing, because the production is amazing, it's on movies level, I'm so disappointed with the writing because this could've been made into something so much better, the story line isn't something that'll hook you especially if you're as picky as I am, and the chemistry between the leads wasn't good, at all, it was rather cheap, and so goes for the comedy and the love triangle thing with sung rok, and suzy literally existed to just be in love with the male lead for most of the series, she was given a strong role but it was just the title, she was a special agent but she wasn't that good, and as for sung gi, a stuntman can't pull all of that, he can't just fight with trained men and agents and knock them all to the ground, it was very unrealistic, I wish someone else other than suzy played this role, with different writing and someone who can actually act instead of suzy this could've been something, but the ending is something, I'll watch season 2 if there's one

Read till the end to find out.
Vagabond is not your average typical Kdrama. From the cast to the film making, plot and direction included, everything is so well rounded and brilliant.
[Lee Seungi is my new favourite actor <3]
The well knitted conspiracies that are dug into deeper in every new episode will just blow your mind. It just shows how the real world is full of dirty politics at every step. And don't be mistaken just because it's got politics and syndication. It won't bore you. Every setting and scene has something to unveil to the audience, there's no fillers at all.
And then there's action and romance, too.
The main characters have so much chemistry. It's wholesome. Puts a smile on your face unknowingly.
Also, Cha Dal Gun is what? The Korean Tom Cruise? The action scenes give you life. They are so awesome.
Not to forget Shin sung rok as Ki Taewoong, you'd love his upright character. Dude is a wonderful actor.
The team's put in a lot of effort and it shows.
Highly recommended.

Vagabond is extremely fast-paced and action-packed, with countless twists and turns. The premise is devastating and compelling, pulling you instantly onto the side of the male lead, Cha Dal Geon, played by Lee Seung Gi. While I commend his fearlessness and feel for his grief, I also shook my head at his hotheaded temper and impulsiveness. Sometimes I wish he would be more cautious or thorough. I'm not a huge fan of Suzy but thought she did a solid job as the female lead Go Hae Ri. My favorite characters were actually supporting characters: Ki Tae Woong, Gong Hwa Sook (Hwang Bo Ra is hilarious), and Lily (love her bickering with Kim Do Soo).

However, there are so many different people involved in the conspiracy that it can be overwhelming. It was sometimes difficult to track how much time had passed. Sometimes events were occurring concurrently, but sometimes we'd be going back in time, flashbacks came into play every once in a while, and then other times days had passed? Towards the end, I especially felt more aware of plot holes, recklessness, and ridiculousness. I would have also liked to see more depth and layers for many characters. Overall though, very entertaining. I hope there's a second season to complete the story. The last episode didn't feel like a final episode at all but more like an American mid-season/winter finale.

I was dreading this moment, mostly because i was conflicted throughout this drama regarding on how to rate it. 16 episodes later and i can safely say that the plot is a worthy 4/10 but the enjoyment was a solid 9/10 so there you go... solve this puzzle for me!

Short version: If you enjoy thriller/mysteries with suspence and action packed scenes with various plot twists that will keep you at the edge of your seat, this is highly recommended. A good watch.

Long Version: Well... not so much.....

So... what we have here? We have a super ambitious drama on our hands. If i had one word to describe vagabond that word would be ambitious.

I'll take the time to carefully present both positive and negative points of this drama, so we can decide on the final score together.

THE GOOD
First thing that comes to mind when i think of Vagabond is scheming and plot twists. The drama starts as a revenge story about an uncle who wants to avenge the death of his nephew. Been there done that. It evolves in SO much more than this, leaving, what this seems to be at the end, a very small detail to be a mere plot device to start the plot. The drama evolves rapidly, including the police force, the NIS, the korean government, several multinational companies and even terrorist organizations...

I was disgusted and yet amazed at the filthyness of the government and pretty much the system of every sector depicted here. I loved to hate these people, the thing that made this drama a hit for me and will be kept memorable for! I can see, however, how this might be too much for some people to swallow and stand by to watch.

More specifically, Including and exploiting a country's own government and police force and pretty much everything legal, showing their worst possible face was especially hard to sit by and watch, but i can easily say this was the drama's highlight. I can applaud the writer for actually going as far as incrimination and even -if i may say- humiliating government executives, striving to show how everything is and -mainly- everyone is rotten to the core. Manipulation of people all in the name of power. *applauds*

Moreover, the drama is packed with fight scenes, which were... well executed, i admit, but... we've definitely seen better.

Furthermore, it has 16 episodes and around 32 plot twists. If it gets one thing right it is that you are kept at the edge of your seat like ALL THE FREAKING time, which makes the drama very binge-worthy! The twists were well delivered, both time-wise and plot wise. Some of them were kind of expected, but all of them were welcome, even if they touched upon the ""tiring"" territory more or less.

*thinks hard*
Ah! Well written.... villains! This might be more of a personal preference but i figured the villains were greatly written and quite well sustained throughout the episodes. They kept their -pretty questionable- values till the end and it was very fulfilling to watch.

All in all, a thriller/mystery like Vagabonds in its very core seems to be suspenseful and intriguing. If the drama achieved something this is it. There wasn't a dull moment and that is very much appreciated!

THE BAD
First of all, the drama suffered, like pretty much every drama of this genre, of terribly convenient writing, inconsistencies, superhuman main characters, and a very very experimental/unfulfilling ending.

In more detail, starting from the first episode, i just couldnt ignore the ridiculous superhuman main male lead role. Excessively unnecessary to the point it actually ruined half of the fight scenes for me. There is no reason for the male lead to be superman, if i wanted to watch superman i'd go watch.... superman. Ridiculous and way too overdone.

Moreover, the number of good vs bad people. Bish... come on. I get the plot twists and i expect half of ""the good"" guys change territories halfway through the show, but it was again way too overdone here. This in combination with the fact that the good guys were extremely naive and gullible, while the bad guys were cunning and smart and.... dunno... normal people, made this a whole lot more unrealistic. I get the overdramatization but you can't present me such wholesome bad guys and such stupid heroes and expect me to root for the heroes just for trying to do the right thing. Nope, that ain't me.

I wasn't the biggest fun of the fight scenes camera work. Shaking the camera during the action because.... they believe i'd feel like being there? Meh, no i ain't 12. Sorry

Dramas like this are known for not having any romance involved. That is a good thing in my book. While Vagabond didn't -thank god- have any proper romance development, there were quite a few *moments* between the main characters. I have to admit they were cute and they kind of served a purpose, but other than the comic relief and the cuteness they didn't bring anything to the table other than that.

All in all, many were the times i rolled my eyes so hard my eyes were almost stucked at the back of my head because of the stupidity and the directional choices for the characters. I dare to say that the drama, by its end, has developed in so many levels that it can arguably be expanded in its own francise with multiple seasons/movies. All this raw potential never get explored but instead we get some half assed final episode that tries to do too much and while it does succeed to a certain degree, it pains me to say that i can personally write a 22 episode season based on this ending that we will never see.

In the very end, i think Vagabond's own ambition destroyed it, or -let's not be so harsh- kind of killed it from within.

ACTING
Unpopular opinion: All the sub characters were better than the 2 leads.

Suzy has come a long way, and was a pleasure to watch, but she has a long way to go still.
Lee Seung Gi.... was good... But that is pretty much it, which leaves a lot to be desired next to supporting characters like Moon Jeong Hee who was... to die for in her particular role.

Finishing the hat, let's keep this simple. You like suspenseful dramas, with numerous plot twists that will not leave you keep calm for a split second? You don't mind switching off your mind and overlooking exaggerated siliness? You enjoy bad guys doing their thing the worst way possible? Then this drama is for you. I can easily recommend it, but know what you are getting into. For everyone else, this would most probably be a no. I don't regret watching it, mainly because of the world building, but over than that, this was cheap and unfulfilling.

Vagabond: An Uncomfortable but Interesting Watch
Vagabond is probably one of the most uncomfortable K-dramas I've seen. It's not the cast or plot, but the corruption shown in the plot. I guess we're so used to the lovey dovey dramas that when a serious one like this comes along, it's hard to swallow. However, they did try to restore your faith in humanity by showing scenes where the people would come together and take a stand.

Overall, I'd say it's an interesting drama. The plot, direction and acting we're amazing. I usually don't like Bae Suzy but she grew on me in this drama. Lee Seungi's portrayal of Cha Dal-geon screamed Lee Seungi. I was constantly reminded of his character in A Korean Odessy. Shin Sung Rok was an eye candy. I wish he'd get more starring roles like this.

The music was pretty mediocre except for one song (Breaking Dawn).

The end was weird. I understand cliffhangers but this was just unfinished. It was like It's Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong (for those who've seen the movie). The drama felt like it ended in the middle of an episode. Unless, they're planning to return with season 2, the ending sucked and left us with many questions.

Conclusion: you'll like Vagabond if you can handle heavy plots. They laid out so many mysteries that I was forced to watch it till the end and find answers. It was interesting, but honestly, I doubt I'd rewatch it. Maybe if season 2 comes out I might.

I think what makes this drama the most disappointing is how it was not neatly wrapped up in the conventional 16 episodes because there's no promise of a conclusion (season 2). It is a cliffhanger. This leaves me feeling very uneasy...

Besides the unsatisfactory ending to ""season 1"" of Vagabond...
I actually ate up this drama! I like the plot, the actors, and the OST! OST was beautiful and well orchestrated. The actors were well selected and portrayed their characters well. The plot was quick paced, action packed, and interesting. While I wasn't expecting the HUGE plot twist in the end of season 1, it *did* make sense (they play enough flashbacks to justify that it *was* planned).

Something I would like to mention though - I didn't find myself tearing up with the actors. The OST really helped build the scenes, but I don't think that the grief-stricken scenes were filmed in the best fashion. Not to say that they weren't sad, but I honestly don't think they were filmed in a way to extract the most emotion from the audience and get us choked up, which I would have really liked.

I think my impression of season 1 will significantly improve if a season 2 releases that effectively ties up all loose ends. Until then, I will caution viewers against watching this drama simply for the lack of conclusion. I look forward to a season 2!

Depends on what you are looking for
Before I started watching this drama, I expected it to one of the best, although it wasn't. The acting is very good and I love the main characters. The problem is with the story. I didn't understand anything as there were a lot of plot twists and characters involved. Memorizing the names was SOOOO HARD!!

I didn't like the story that much. You know those series where there are not a lot of scenes were main characters are shown? That is this drama. I think in the one hour episodes, only 15 minutes were dedicated to the main characters. The rest were the older people talking to each other which I find boring.

Overall, I wanted this drama to end faster, so that I could start the next. But if you like political and action dramas, then this drama is for you!

I didn't like the series a lot
The story didn't attract my attention. I wanted the drama to end faster so that I could start the next drama (happy I started Kill me Heal me and I loved it with all my heart!!).

The acting was awesome, but the plot was confusing. There were a lot of plot twists and tens of characters (I don't liked dramas that have multiple characters. I just seem to confuse all of them together , oohhh and the names are so hard to memorize).

The drama just didn't feel right, maybe because there were a lot of political aspects to this drama and not a lot of things that are interesting at my age (17).

(the ending was so confusing as well, it even made me think I closed the tab in the middle of the drama).

Like a Hollywood production in Soutk Korea
This drama is like a Hollywood production that, due to political correctness and several anti-government theories, was transferred to Korea without any concern for cultural or political realities. The drama is shot with a lot of panache and splendor - too much for my taste. It's nice that the action takes place in different places in the world, but it's a pity that the creators treated really different cultures very neglectfully. The idea for the story and ML - funny. Really, South Korea is not the US and moving Hollywood production to the other hemisphere without any adjustment is not for me. I watched this drama as an experiment, besides, I have a weakness for actors playing the main roles, and this drama made me feel bad. The scene when the Korean SWAT in downtown Seoul on a magically empty street starts shooting Korean citizens in broad daylight was the decisive moment for me, when I couldn't stand the drama's quirks anymore.

The lines between good and evil are muddy
I wasn't sure I would like Vagabond initially because I don't really like political dramas, but this show was done really well that I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to binge it all at once!

I was most impressed by the characterisations. I love Cha Dalgun's intensity, his energy and perseverance in finding the truth behind the flight's crash. And does becoming a stuntman really give you all these survival and combat skills? He can do literally anything while suffering mild/minor injuries, so kudos to him. Go Haeri is great. She has a lot of pride for her country and this drive to serve the people, despite the increasingly pessimistic situation she finds herself in. Corruption ran deep into the roots of the government, and yet she is still determined to expose the truth. I also love the chemistry between the two leads. They bicker a lot but obviously care for each other. It sucks where they end up by the final episode, but hopefully season 2 (if it ever happens) lets them have a happy ending.

The main thing you should keep in mind when watching this show is that no one is what they seem (except, of course, for the two protagonists). People you think are good end up being the most corrupt, and those who seem evil at first glance can be even more evil, or turn out to be okay in the end. The plot keeps revealing more twists, and the person you root for may change over the course of 16 episodes. Don't trust a character too easily.

Vagabond is a fast-paced show filled with corruption, crooked officials and cunning schemes. You desperately hope that our protagonists will win in the end, but with that brutal cliffhanger ending, who knows? I do hope there will be a season 2 coming soon!

Didn't meet my expectations
Before starting to watch it, I read some reviews on many sites including this one. And I thought ""This drama has to be something"". But after starting it I was disappointed. I'm not saying that this drama is bad or something. It's a pretty good action drama with some intense action scenes, some awesome plot twists. I liked all of it. But about the story I mean it was neither good or bad. It was okay I guess. The story being bad this drama didn't felt boring even for a moment which is a good thing. And after finishing one episode you will immediately want to watch the next. The main actors did a wonderful job. But I didn't like the acting of some supporting roles.
Now about it's color grading. It was so bad. I mean usually we get colorful or standard color grading. But after seeing vagabond's color grading it feels like it was shoot in 2010. Also all the characters use mobile phones from 2010. So seeing it makes you feel odd. Then about the music it was pretty good with the action scenes but sometimes there was no background music. It was all silence. I hate this kinds of music composing.

So this drama is not an waste of time. It's definitely worth watching. But the story could have been better I think. But the action scenes makes you forget all of that and makes it enjoyable.

I enjoyed it a lot... until the last episode
I don't think it's a spoiler to warn that this show doesn't end. Maybe they'll make a second season to end the story and it will but, so far, the story is unfinished.

I have to say I enjoyed a lot the action scenes, the plot, the villains, the good guys... even the hints of romance. It is a very fun series to watch and I would've probably rated it with a 9 or more if they had finished the story. They set up the plot and left it unfinished, I wouldn't even say it's a cliffhanger where many storylines are resolved but something happens to move the story in a different direction, no, it's just that as they couldn't wrap up everything in the last episode, they left the story there.

I have to say I like the actors and the casting in general was charismatic and good for their roles.

The action sequences were good, though I think they could've been improved if they had cut them less often: it looks like they have good stuntpeople to make them work without so many cuts and that, in my opinion, allows the viewer to enjoy them more.

I loved the OST, it's full of great songs.

WE WANT SEASON 2
I am writing this review 2 years after I watched the show, LOL. But after watching Lee Seung Gi's ""Mouse"", I suddenly wanted to write a review for this show as well. LSG is such a versatile actor. He can sing, act, host, dance - there's nothing he can't do. He was the main reason I picked up this show in the first place.

I'd really like to say that LSG and Suzy had the best chemistry EVER. Some might not agree with me, but I think LSG is the best actor Suzy has had chemistry with.

The plot was something that had never been seen in any of the kdramas, and that's why it was a refresher. Lot of action and thriller - my favourite genre - so absolutely loved it!

My only reason of giving this show a 9.5 is because THEY AREN'T COMING OUT WITH S2! WE NEED S2 ASAP!!

From the beginning Bae Suzy takes you to a fantastic, and mystical place with her stunning visuals, and acting in Morocco. Then Lee Seung-gi takes you on a sensual roller coaster, which makes you sometimes question your own sexuality with his stunning abs, and good looks. Its hard enough being a pretty boy, but then his amazing acting, and action scenes makes you question your existence. Overall this series is something totally gripping, and unexpected with many twists, and turns, and dark conspiracies. Lee Ki-young is a bad-ass MOFO, once you realise his important role in the drama, but then there's all the crazy scum villains who deserve to be killed. All this EMOTION from the one drama is too much for me... I need therapy.

Intense, Confident Action but Overly Edgy
PROS
+ Suspense & action to the MAX
+ Fast-paced with minimum downtime
+ Impressive action scenes and stunts
+ Emotion provoking conflict (you will be sucked in & want justice for our protagonist)
+ Flashbacks are used effectively
+ High budget cinematography & variety of locations
+ Great music/sound production

CONS
- Overly confident plot twists
- Outcomes of scenes may not always be logical
- Villains appears one-directional
- Some mysteries will be unexplained
- Low rewatch value - due to the show's reliance on the mystery

SUMMARY
This drama will hit you HARD on the suspense. Want an good action and mystery hitter? I recommend this one because it is packed with it. Part of the enjoyment comes from the quest of finding out the truth or who the real culprit is. As our protagonist, Cha Dal Geon uncover details of a horrific plane crash, fighting his way through mercenaries and lobbyists, numerous plot twists will arise. Unfortunately, the plot does get progressively messy as the story unfolds and you may start questioning its legitimacy. Outcomes of some scenes also feel very unbelievable and not every detail in the story is explained properly. Fortunately, the performance of the main cast is impressive; their characters are likeable, sensible and relatable to the situations they face. Combined with well-produced action sequences, it becomes easy for us viewers to turn a blind eye or two on some of the crazy showdown that just happened, as unrealistic as they are. Some people will find the plot made to be too edgy especially towards the last couple of episodes. Regardless of how important movie logic is to you, it is still a very compelling plot and definitely worth the hours to watch.

Vagabond is one of the most unrealistic but best action drama I've experienced so far. I love the storyline although there is something like too many plot twists. But overall the performances were great. it was one of Bae Suzy's work in a while so it was nice seeing her on-screen again and my first time watching Lee Seungi and he gave a very good impression depicting his character.
The storyline centers around a man who lost his nephew on a plane crash and a woman working for the Korean Secret Service, together they uncover the mystery and corruption that caused the plane crash, opening the blinds to a bigger picture, bigger than them. I loved the scenery of the drama I think they invested a lot of time and money into making it look and good as It should be and it seriously paid off. if you're looking for a drama to get you up and down and still make you laugh then you should definitely watch Vagabond

I hate cliffhangers. I usually wait until entire stories are finished before I start to watch. What a surpirse it was for me that this ended the way it did. If I would have known there was a cliffhanger I would not have wasted my time watching this. Now I am annoyed. The way they ended this story was not only confusing, but really unsatisfying. How did the main characters lives change so much? I felt like a big chunk was missing in the end. Is has been over a year and no mention of a second season.

A season two would not be too much
The story is overall good. However, it may be too cliché and some scenes are not realistic but very much bearable and still very enjoyable. Furthermore, until the episode 12, the political aspect is boring (I've almost skipped them all). Aside of that (political aspect), everything is capticating in the story. Basically, the team of the hero is searching the truth despite of all the obstacles (manipulation, betrayal, corruption, fighting/killing) in their path. The last three episodes were the best because since the episode 13, even the political aspect becomes surprisingly interesting and entertaining. The twist is what I've also enjoyed a lot! A second season will be welcomed, without a doubt!

The acting is great, they are doing a good job in their respective roles. The music is very good
Would I want to rewatch it again ? Certainly not the episodes in the middle of the drama but the firsts three episodes and the last three episodes yes I would.

After watching this series, i came to realisation that some people turn their brains and heads upside down when watching dramas, I don't think a normal person in his or her right senses would watch this and still have negative reviews. This is one of the best korean action series I've come across, the story, writing, casting, and acting was just to superb. So i don't know why someone, all in the name of senselessness criticize this drama.................I'm so pained ooo.............................

When I saw the trailer to Vagabond, I was totally set on watching the series especially due to the cast Seung-gi and Suzy. But in all honesty when I heard that many people were disappointed with the ending, I put off watching it.
But later I decided to watch it despite that negative factor. In my opinion Vagabond is a great drama and it felt like a never ending movie.

The story was on-going with non-stop action and there was so many plot twists which I loved and hated at the same time. The action and story line is what kept me so invested in and intrigued with this drama and I found it so refreshing to watch especially after watching many romance dramas. Though I wanted more to happen with the couple, I was fine with the mini moments.

The drama will make you feel sad, angry, happy or even empowered at times. Watching this series felt like a puzzle and though the saying goes 'expect the unexpected' in this drama you 'don't expect the expected'. I'd say the production quality is quite high and there is also a lot of gun violence as a warning.

Though I mentioned earlier that many people were disappointed with the ending, in my opinion it was suitable and I am not disappointed but that's just what I feel. It leaves viewers asking a lot of questions but also opens a door of possibility of a second season.

Overall, it was a very captivating and a drama worth your time, highly recommended for action genre lovers!

Vagabond includes many things like suspense,thriller,action scenes,light romance, politics. And after every episode you are left with the feeling ""what would happen next"". The drama has lots of suspense in it, which ensures your constant appeal to it. I loved the acting of Lee Sung-gi and Bae Suzy. They both make a good team together. From the start their teamwork leads to successfull unveiling of the secret behind the plane crash. Their are lots of stunts in it, I loved it!

Likes: Lee Seung gi. Seung gi as an action hero. Seung gi’s flashback mullet hair. Production Value. Fast paced editing.

Dislikes: There is not one instance where I believed Suzy was a NIS agent. Sorry, but no.

You can tell that they shelled out the big bucks on this kdrama because the production value was high. With lots of fast paced action scenes, this kdrama reminded me of a cross between Jason Bourne and Homeland.

There were some definite glaring flaws (secret government missions…pffffft…yeah, not so secret. Apparently you can reveal classified info to regular citizens as long as you are on the “good side”). And some of the acting (ahem, Suzy) will require some overlooking, but overall the suspense and action made this an enjoyable watch. Seung gi really gave his all to the action scenes and to the emotional scenes as well. I can’t remember any other kdrama that has done action scenes to this degree so it was a nice change.

There wasn’t too much romance in this drama and the chemistry wasn’t the sizzling kind, but Suzy and Seung gi worked well together so it wasn’t too much of a bummer. The ending will make you wonder if there will be a season 2?

Vagabond is most excited drama ever. Action,thriller, romantic story line is amazing. LSG & Suzy really hard working actors in Korean industry,. It's drama is not ordinary a kdrama.this drama actions are like a Hollywood movie,, at a such great level,No this is better than Hollywood .Lee SeungGi is such a hard working man.
Rarely romantic scene but it all are heart melting scene and feel it lot,their chemistry is no joke,no need passionate kissing for my heart melting. #SeungZy is best couple in kdrama.
vagabond that is too enabling my brain cells,I'm curious about true villain of this drama.
I can't waiting for last two episode
I'm huge fan of Seungzy and vagabond from Sri Lanka.
I hope this drama will be happy ending and season 2.

This is no exaggeration ,In my honest comment ,This is masterpiece. no words to describe.

and we are looking forward to season 2 hopefully. #Vagabondseason2

Great Watch!
Vagabond contains a mass amount of tense, humorous, gripping, shocking and cleverly plotted and written moments to be truly called one of the greatest action dramas. The first episode is perhaps one of the greatest first episodes in the history of world drama television - tied with 'Stranger'. I wasn't familiar with the majority of the casting for this drama, however there were some phenomenal performances, making me want to research these cast members so I can purposely watch more dramas with these actors and actresses in them! I was a little disappointed in the ending of this drama, however I do believe there will be more than one season of Vagabond.

I think anyone has the chance to absolutely love this drama, I recommend everyone to give this a go when they can!

Trust No One
Is there anything project that Lee Seung-gi decides to do that is bound to fail? The man is seriously talented and keeps going from strength to strength. Each new series gets darker than the last! Vagabond offers something new to the Kdrama genre. You can see it has a massive budget behind it through the gorgeous cinematography, international locations & visual effects which are all very impressive. The action is literally non-stop! We have the winning combination of Lee Seung-gi & Bae Suzy, previously seen to great effect in Gu Family Book. They work really well together. I would have loved to have seen more romance but I guess that will come with the sequel (whenever that maybe)! What's strange is that at the beginning he is portrayed as a loser stuntman & she is seen as a femme fatale spy but then their roles switch and he's suddenly an amazing stuntman that is mistaken for a spy owing to his amazing abilities and she has zero skills as a spy who is just doing the job to support her family...no doubt to reinforce gender stereotypes. Usually in Kdramas you will find at least one token American who acts badly...but in this it's slightly better...we have Jessica who speaks English quite well, the Moroccan police inspector who was quite good as well as the other Moroccan cast members only Michael was a bit off. Every time I see Hwang Bo-ra I'm instantly reminded of Joan Cusack, I think she's a great supporting actress and gives great comic relief. Another great supporting actor is Shin Sung-rok, who I thought could have been better utilised, as he is very talented but his part did get better as it went on. What struck me about the story was how brutal it was at the start, I mean...spoiler alert....a young child is killed and this is what the whole story hinges on. All of Lee Seung-gi actions are out of love for his nephew, which really does give new meaning to 'the power of love', he becomes the everyman underdog fighting corruption at every turn. The ending...if you can call it that, is left open for a sequel, which was very risky as there was no resolution, now what with the Covid delay and conflicting actors schedules I don't see it happening any time soon, which is a real shame particularly because it is in the Action genre, you can't wait too long as the actors won't be able to do the scenes anymore...look at Indy 4!!! :)

Terrorist attack bring down plane so many innocent people killed. To get a trillion dollars military plane contract. None of them got their bodies back. The plane landed in the sea. So far his computer has been stolen with all the videoes his nephew took on the plane. One of the office staff killed. He was nearly killed twice and she Suzy/Go Hae Ri was nearly killed by an assassin. Her computer. And copy of the videos stolen. The NIS computer room in Korea has got a virus and only one copy of the videos is left but now has a virus. There is a mole in the NIS office I hope its not Shin Sung Rok/Ki Tae Woong. He looks so spunky as an agent better than he looked in “Perfume”. The moles code name is “Shadow”

211 people died in the crash 108 Koreans. They lost the evidence. Hey! Moon Jung Hee/Jessica Lee [President of John & Mark Asia] has got a copy of the video. Her insurance is it. Lily the killer has arrived at her house. Fresh from killing someone in America. She put up her killing price because he is a good man. Take it or leave it she tell them. She want to do a tour of Korea. Where there are lots of tombs. The boss wants a clean kill no guns or poison. So she wants it to look like and accident. I’m Lily angel of death. Park Ah In/Lily [Professional Killer]

Kim Jung Hyun/Dang Ki-Se he was cruel, ruthless, intimidating and hateful but he was so memorable. I watched “Empress Ki” ages ago but when I see him in another drama or movie his character in this drama comes back to me. How he was the one who spotted her as a woman straight away. He knew all the nuances of a woman and the smell of a woman. He’s got a great part in this drama as minion of those at the top. Jessica is in jail now but his position is still secure.

They are doing bush surgery in the embassy with bare tools that they can find in their. The guys screaming and blood spurting every wear as they are hacking his leg open to find the vein. Then he faints while they carry on trying to save his life.
They are trying to leave Morocco. So its the slow boat to Korea.

I need to edit this because I've finished watching ""Vagabond"". Loved this drama and was waiting every week for each episode in New Zealand. Outstanding with megastar actors. Is vagabond really finished? No way! They must be one more episode surely it can't end like that. So frustrating. I was thinking to have another rant at the writers bad enough when Arthdal Chronicles ended on a cliffhanger. I tell you it better have a sequel I was so angry when the beginning first episode was actually the end. Oh its not good enough when they do this to us viewers. It is so rage inducing. I would never have watched it if I had known this.

A great drama with unsatisfying cliffhanger ending
This drama is a great drama. It has a good story and the acting is also very good. I love the cast because of Nations first love (Bae Suzy). I kind of fell for her while watching this. But the thing is, this drama has an unsatisfying ending. Cliffhangers are what I hate most. Eventhough I hated the ending, I kept waiting for a second season. The reason why many love kdramas is because they wrap the story within 16-20 episodes. But thanks to Netflix we have lost the uniqueness of kdramas and we have American-type multiple season kdramas.

As a summary, these are the questions we had while watching this drama.

When the drama started
1. Who was behind the plane crash?
2. Will they reveal the truth?
3. Will Cha Dal Geon and Go Hae Ri date?
4. What will happen to the corrupted government?

When the drama ended
1. Who is the real culprit behind the plane crash?
2. Will they reveal the truth?
3. Will Cha Dal Geon and Go Hae Ri date?
4. What will happen to the corrupted government?
5. Who is the real villain?
6. Is Jessica not guilty at all?
7. Will Dal Geon reveal the truth about Kim Woo Gi's Death?
8. Will the leading couple have a happy ending?
9. When will the second season come out, or will there be a second season?

As you can see, nothing has been solved. And the questions have grown. Everything is tangled. This really pisses me off and leaves me with an empty heart. It is very annoying when I want another season, but it is not confirmed or denied. This is a really good drama and if you want to live with the greatness of this drama, miss the final episode. I am writing this in 2022 and there is no detail about Vagabond season 2. So I agreed to live with an imaginary ending and I will keep hating NETFLIX for ruining precious k-dramas.

The action drama you've been waiting for
Spoilers alert:
Loved; the action, seriously the opening episode is explosive but the fight choreography all the way through was excellent and I loved how it used Dal Geon's background as a stunt man to make the action more interesting.
Loved; the chemistry of the leads but also the fact that the story didn't focus on romance. So many 'action' dramas turn into never ending 'will they won't they' mushy love-fests, this doesn't and it's better for it.
Loved; the constant revelations, cliff hangers and double crosses. Makes for very exciting viewing. Have to say the 'ultimate baddy' is not hard to guess as they are hiding in plain sight but getting to that reveal was hella fun.
Loved; the badass women. Instead of watching love sick women get bossed about by men it was great to see the women (whether good or bad) be victorious in the face of doubters or just being super villains.
Disliked: I'd like to say nothing, but I can't decide if I loved the ending or need more. My main complaint about most non k-dramas is that they go on for 5 years and the story never really gets resolved...so if it ends here I will be happy and still give 10/10 but I would watch a hypothetical season 2 in a heartbeat.
Neutral comment: I know ALL dramas have product placement but it was particularly un- subtle in this, not that it affects me really...anyway, I'm off to get a Subway wearing my Lancôme lipstick.

What a ride.
Well, a journey this series.
As the synopsis suggests, the starting story is basic to dozens of action movies and series, a loved one of the main protagonist - the nephew - dies at the hands of an organization that wields powers over several institutions in the country.
The main character, here Cha Dal Gun, is obviously a capable character, he's a stunman who knows how to fight and isn't afraid to run into a wall - literally.
After his nephew's death appears to be an accident, he quickly discovers that it is not what it seems. He meets Go Hae Ri, a young woman who works for the Korean secret services and who will help him in his investigation.

I must say that my opinion is divided on the series.
I'm not going to lie, the series is very addictive, we quickly want to know the adventures of our characters, and the plot is well done.
The action scenes are to my surprise very well done although there is a bit of fiction when the character heals quickly, but that's the problem with action series and movies. I can't say that we are bored and the rhythm is very fast until the end, no break and therefore the audience is captivated.

The plot as a whole, although very fictional and basic, where corruption reigns and our characters cannot trust anyone because everyone is lying, remains in a fairly realistic and mature tone. Sometimes, we can also see the criticism of this series towards politicians, the media, and we say to ourselves at the same time as our characters ""You are destroying the country you claim to want to save"".
So overall, a good story that goes from twists to twists.

What bothers me are the characters.
I must say that Lee Seung Gi who plays Cha Dal Gun did a very good job, although we don't explore so many layers to his character who remains stubborn and sometimes impulsive until the end, he shows the desperate side correctly, a side that is often missing in the characters of the series who interpret the same kind of roles.
But it's still mainly an action series, so I didn't expect a lot of character development. However, I would have liked him to be less hot-headed and to be a more strategic and thoughtful character.
But I liked discovering him in this role.

However, this is where the problem arises, the bad LF syndrome. That's what I'm going to call this habit that actresses have of being FL and annoying.
Here, we supposedly have a young spy and secret service agent, okay it's quite realistic that she can't fight because in reality, all over the world, secret agents are sent for their intellectual abilities and not physical.
But her character remains annoying, when in the middle of a shooting, every time she finds that it's time to discuss and impose her opinion, namely - to stay still until she dies - and to prevent the main character to change the situation, it's annoying. Also her insane craving for recognition, looks like a kid who needs to be complimented all the time, while most of the time she makes the problem worse, she is naive and trusting, which is ridiculous for a supposed spy.
I know it's hard to find the middle ground between the clichés of the badass and the cute, weak FL one, but her performance just makes her annoying.
She's more the type to be the cause of someone's death than the one who saves the day.

The secondary characters are passable, no characters that shine in particular, the cast gives a performance that is believable but not breathtaking.

So, to sum it up, it's a series where you shouldn't expect incredible acting from the cast - except the action scenes and Lee Seung Gi. It's a series in realistic tones and is primarily made to make you feel the action, I mean, the action scenes are not overplayed but on the contrary well done.
The ML so, Lee Seung Gi is perfect in this role, the little romance with the FL is really realistic on this point, they take their time even if the acting of the FL overall is not the best.
It is therefore a series that I would say to see absolutely for entertainment, the comic moments are rather rare because the series has a serious tone but the action remains the center focus.

I hope a season 2 will see the light of day, I know that the two years that we had of Covid-19 did not help the projects in the industry and a lot of them were canceled, but knowing that the main actor said he himself wants a second season because season 1 ended on a cliffanger. And also that since the series is available on Netflix it has gained a fair amount of popularity, I hope they give us a thrilling sequel.

A Great Action-Packed K-Drama?
Vagabond is a great action-filled drama to me. If you are into fights, gun battles, and car chases, Vagabond wouldn’t bore you. But it is not just senseless violence either. There is a plot behind it and a convincing storyline of why things happen the way they did. So, it is intriguing for me as I’m led down the line of a corrupted government and shady business dealings whereby everybody is selfishly looking after their own personal interests except for a few upright characters. I’m also not a big fan of Lee Seung Gi and Bae Suzy but I think they did well in Vagabond as 2 unlikely partners. They work together very well for the intense action needed in this drama.

Great… But It Has One Major Setback
I think this would put many people off from watching Vagabond – an ending that is left hanging. It is an ending that is tailor-made for a Season 2 because Hae Ri doesn’t know that Dal Gun is alive while Edward and Hong are still roaming free despite their involvement in the plane crash. So, if you are expecting a neat ending that ties up everything whereby the bad guys are sent to jail, you will be disappointed.

Since we don’t know if there will be a next season, you will have to watch Vagabond with the expectation that there is no happy ending to make you feel good. It is inconclusive that leaves you neither here nor there. The fact that Dal Gun and Hae Ri have turned into a mercenary and lobbyist respectively in their quest for revenge may also leave a sour taste in the mouth for some because it is as if they have turned into the very people they hate.

Furthermore, Vagabond is not a romance drama like Her Private Life or What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim. It is an action drama with hardly any romantic scenes although you can sense there is an underlying attraction between Dal Gun and Hae Ri. However, this attraction is not fully developed throughout the 16 episodes which some viewers might find lacking. Personally, I feel that if there is more to their love story, then the viewers’ feelings could get more intense as the drama moves towards the end.

My Verdict On Vagabond
I would recommend a watch for Vagabond despite its open ending. It is fast-paced and the storyline is good to start with especially for the first 10 to 12 episodes. There is a bit of twist and turn in the last few episodes that seems to just lengthen the show but I feel that the bulk of the story has already made its impression on me that I can easily continue all the way to the end. The political power play can be a bore to some but it is the background required for the reason the truth on the plane crash is hidden and for it to eventually unfold.

The bottom line is watch it for the action and plot but be forewarned about the ending. Then, you won’t feel that you have wasted 16 hours of your time for nothing! ?

Vagabond is a drama about government corruption and conspiracies that starts to unravel after a plane crash. The drama is packed with action and it has great cinematography and music. The actions scenes are very well choreographed and realistic. Although the main leads get closer and it is obvious that they developed romantic feelings, there’s no romance. All the main and supporting cast was great bringing their characters to life and the plot was consistent with the conspiracies that abound. The overall acting by the grieving families was fantastic and makes the viewer feel the pain and frustration as they navigate and participate in the process of finding the truth about the plane crash. The drama could’ve had a rating of 10 if it would not have been that it ended with a cliffhanger that gives the impression that there will be a second season. Overall, it is very entertaining, enjoy it!

One of the best drama
This one is my second favorite kdrama.
The story is very amazing and will keep you in suspense till the very end. Unlike other drama this has some unique story plot twist and what i liked the most is the writers did not ruin the story with romance.
This drama is of another level❤️? The action and all those fight scene were to die for ❤️
The ending was a bit twisted whether season 2 will come or not it ended with a little suspense
Loved the Leads ❤️ Every one acted superb . Lilly was on fire ?.
I wonder why it is not so famous.
A very must watch drama

The title should rather be ""Vagabomb"" because this drama is bomb ! ?

It's one of my favorite dramas !
The script is well written and thoughtful, except for some small things. We see that it was written in advance and not during filming, unlike most other dramas. Everything is important, even the smallest things. Huge talent of the screenwriter !
They put a lot of suspense especially at the end of episodes, and many intense action scenes. I also really liked the realistic side. And the fact that all along, we doubt almost all the characters, gives an even more intense side to the plot
There are a lot of twists and unexpected things, this drama is really surprising

I loved the characters, especially the ""bad ones"". My favorite character is Lily (Park Ah In). I immediately loved her, I love her personality as well as her elegance, her charisma... And she's so sexy ? Which does not spoil anything. I'm FAN !
The role of Suzy (Go Hae Ri) radically changes her from her usual roles, it's much more adult and mature ! For those who don't like her, try to watch her in this drama, it really changes her.
I also really liked Hwang Bo Ra as Kong Hwa Sook. She's very touching and she's someone we can trust

One of the drama's only ""inconsistency"" is that Dal Geon seems invincible. He beats everyone, climbing everywhere... Yes, he's a stuntman, but not a superman. It's a bit exaggerated on this point, he never seems to be hurt or tired

I didn't find the OST extraordinary. But the song ""Open Fire"" by The VANE matches the drama very well, as well as ""The God of War"", ""N.I.S"", ""Morocco Run"", and ""What Is Chicken House"", that I really liked.

SPOILER
I am a fan of the ""couple"" of Kim Do Su (Choi Dae Chul) and Lily ! I love them, they are so cute and adorable. I really wished they had ended up dating ! Maybe in season 2 ?
END OF THE SPOILER

Thrilling, fast-paced and loaded with gripping action sequences, Vagabond has certainly raised the bar for action-packed kdramas.

Vagabond starts off slow and sloppy with subtle plot holes and unimpressive lead characters. If only there were less talking and more of swift buildup on the first half, the pacing of the story would have been far from faulty. However, the flaws went unseen as the veteran actors help elevate this series while Seung Gi and Suzy Bae show off their charisma and chemistry. There are also fleeting touches of humour which made it a lot more fun to watch.

On the other hand, the elegance and visual coherence of the set pieces have given this kdrama a discernible impression. Although the big-deal stunts aren't that many, they will still make you jump up and down with exuberance.

Overall, Vagabond is a gratifyingly clever, booby-trapped thriller with the right amount of fun and swoon. Lastly, to those who are skeptical on watching this series, I will give you a piece of advice: don't let the first half's boring dialogues get into your nerves because the exciting action awaits on the later part.

Adore
LOVE LOVE LOVE. Great show, kept me on the edge of my seat all throughout. I find that in most shows (even good) there is a part, a couple episodes that I find boring and that i just have to get through. But this show never was, the action scenes were amazing those really helped. (can't beleive he did them stunts himself). It was a little sad, had just the right amount of comedy, action and drama it was never too much. No romance tho if youre looking for that. Obviously you can feel slight attraction and tension between the leads though. The twist was unexpected because I was so wrapped up in everything else going on. 10/10 recommend only a little disapointed by the ending, that was the only problem for me. I dont know about rewatch quality. I got my cousin to watch it and sat with her and watching it for a second time made me pick up on things and the twsit felt obvious since I knew what is was so I'll never get that feeling i got the first time watching it.

BEST ACTION ROMANCE KDRAMA EVER!!!
This kdrama has the slowest ep 1 ever then suddenly ! BAAAM ! ep 2 onwards were INSANE and it GETS BETTER AND BETTER every episode. Just when you think the main leads can finally rest BOOOOM!!! another shitt happens and every character is so suspicious. Its impossible not to binge watch this. You can definitely finish all 16 episodes in IN JUST 2 DAYS.

Suzy and Seunggi did an amazing job potraying their characters and giving us that tiny bit of ROMANCE that was needed that made this drama even better. Every episode makes you WANT TO WATCH MORE and you end up watching it for 8 hours straight. For reference if you like K2 or Healer then you will LOVE this drama. Even if you don't ........ JUST WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!1

Interesting and well done Drama
Hello there!
Vagabond was a great Drama with an intense and interesting Story. It had really good thriller in it. But also the action was great. After the K2 this is the Drama with the second best action scenes. Like yout probably imagine i has much Drama in it and a tiny little bit of romance. If you are a romance fan than I have to say, that the romance was the only genre that didn't delivere.

The acting was just superb. The two main Actors were incredible and had a gread chemistry. But also the other actors acted more than just good. Vagabond is kinda like a character and story driven Drama with a lot of heart.

It is a Drama that you can easily rewatch, if you want. Just a little warning, like many other Dramas it feels draggy at the last couple of Episodes.

Overall it is a gread Drama with a lot to offer.

I hope you find this Review helpful and if you are gonna watch it I wish you very much fun with it.
Bye

Excellent drama
Vagabond delivered simply by leaving me wanting a second season. This show had a lot going for it, and its casting was near flawless. I thought Suzy and Lee Seung-Gi were exceptional in their roles. The latter in particular highlighted the relentless determination of his character to seek justice for his dead nephew. At the heart of this reckless drive was a despair that veered onto the edges of breakdowns, and the feeling of a character unable to appease his restless guilt until he fixed this. His character was a joy to watch.

Suzy delivered in her role with a performance of realism, humour and authority that made her character enjoyable. Her character dealt with institutional sexism in an agency that never regarded her seriously yet always came to rely on her. Suzy's character lived through a myriad of emotions and lived through all of them very well. Her and Lee Seung-Gi shared strong chemistry that really left you with the sense that Suzy's character was determined to help him as much as possible. Where they shared intimate scenes, the show's emotional pulse hummed. Vagabond didn't disappoint on the action either, as it was laced with some terrific gunfights and car chases that always ramped up the tension.

It was a plot with a thousand twists and no sight of a straight conclusion. Maybe that works for some and less so for others. It did however leave Season 1 poised on a cliffhanger with another season surely needed to wrap this story up. Overall, a deeply enjoyable show.

The Morality of Democracy
You're free to enjoy this as an action with romance and light comedy, but it's really asking the question of what a democratic nation's priorities should be. What it's prime directive should be and how smoke and mirrors can easily fool its citizens, as they don't want to believe complicated plots.

What makes this show work is that it has a good moral story combined with action scenes to keep the pace and light touches of romance and comedy to settle you down. The moral dilemmas visited in this series are the ones we need to solve in the next few decades. If greed motivates a leader is that really worse than some ideology of a great nation. What influences do global conglomerates have on local economics? Can our journalists really uncover or even see all the angles? It forced me to think about these and not all have clear cut answers.

Don't look for realism in the action, don't question whether this is possible. It's not as over the top as some of the McG repertoire such as Charlie's Angels and the Fast & Furious series, but it's still up there in the realm of ""just not possible, but looks really cool"". But the actions sequences have that feel where you keep rooting for the underdog(s) to make it out alive. Given the constant threat of people with a lot of power and money, that's not always a given and that keeps you worrying.

The show also makes crafty use of hindsight: showing a surprise and then explaining it afterwards. The chemistry between the two leads works well, though the female lead sometimes drops the ball when displaying emotions of loss.

Perhaps the best trait is that the show starts with its ending and by the season finale, you hardly remember it. Then - it's all brought into focus and the realization creeps up, that this whole season was really a setup for season 2. Don't worry, season 1 got tied up pretty neatly, but I am really looking forward to that next season if it comes. It is deserving of one.

I just want to ask the writer that if you are making thriller why not end it means why would we watch thrillers so that we can find conclusion of every happenings i was all satisfied with the story the cast and Lee seung gi is the main reason i started this drama because he is perfect with scrip selection but this is the first lee seung gi drama i was disappointed he was perfect in his role the story was good but i have just wasted my 16 hours and got no results and there is no second season????
So if someone want to watch this drama i will recommend you if you are fan of the cast and don't mind open endings

I didn't watch this show when it was airing because I was afraid it was overrated and wouldn't meet my expectations and I'm glad i gave it a try because this drama just proved me wrong!

If I were to describe Vagabond now, I'd say it is a well packaged action drama. From casts, acting, directing, and even production, everything and everyone has been top notch! Watching only the first episode, you'd already get the gist of how high the quality and budget for this drama must be. The action scenes , and the many plot twists in this drama were intense and enough to make you want more of it. Aside from the action scenes, there are some comedy, romance, and politics mixed into the show too, which i think makes the show more interesting.

The unique characters for this drama is another thing to look forward to from this show. I loved how the way the show slowly revealed the true personalities and intention of the characters. It definitely made everything more intense. Also the chemistry of the characters were just amazing. Watching Shin Sung Rok as a skilled and righteous NIS agent was just so endearing. I was sad he wasn't given much focus on the story but still loved his character! The main reason why I watched it was because of him. Watching him shoot away with a gun, he is just perfect for the role! <3

Seung Gi's chemistry with Suzy was great too, but I liked how aside from the few cute moments for the leads, the scriptwriter didn't add any more than what is shown, because it could have been seen unnecessary and forced.

Overall, Vagabond was an entertaining and refreshing drama to watch. It kept me on my seat tense, curious, and furious with every episode. The only problems I have with this show are: the information overload I got with the many characters introduced to us, the cliffhanger at the end, and they way they ended the show without taking down the real bad guy, nor a closure for the side characters.

Hmmm okay. This was a jooourney.
First of all, I want to address that I rank shows purely based on my personal enjoyment of it. Even if a drama is objectively bad, if I had a good time watching it, it'll probably be a 9 or + .
Vagabond might be my favorite drama from the last couple of years. I genuinely connected with the characters and story. I couldn't stop watching, something that rarely happens to me with any type of show. By episode 11, I could feel my heart in my throat (is that an expression in English or is it only of Spanish? lol). I was literally running out of breath by some scenes and situations.
I loved the main characters (Hae-ri and Dal-geon). I really didn't care about Tae-ung but he was ok I guess. Actors who portrayed evil characters did it amazingly. I hated them so much, lol. Even side characters were great, my favorite one was Lily. The lack of romance was an extra point for me (I don't mind it, but I was super focused on the plot and I think adding a lot of romance would have ruined it)
Talking about the plot, there were so many plot twists it was hard to follow but I dig it. I like how you never knew who was actually good and who was actually bad in the story. The drama itself was really expensive, btw, and I love when dramas are based on multiple locations (in this case, Morocco).
Of course the drama was not perfect, I noticed a couple of small plotholes and things that didn't make sense. The ending was very open, the last scene being the beginning of the first episode... that was cool though. But so many things aren't finished. I'm assuming they wrote this ending with a second season in mind, but there's nothing confirmed yet? That kinda worries me. I need to know what happens between these two. Will they be able to take revenge on Edward? Will Hae-ri discover that Dal-geon is not dead? Will they end up together? Will we ever know? That's the question lol.

I'm giving this a 10 out of my enjoyment. The plot is not a 10 though, but still. If there isn't any future seasons then I'm sad to say I'll have to lower my score.

Action Drama That Got Me Into Korean Drama
They said, you never forget your first. This is the case for Vagabond. An action series without romance but can still make me have a good cry. I immediately wanted to see more of Lee Seung Gi and Bae Suzy. This is the effect of Vagabond to me. For that I gave the score 10 even when I think the story is not special. What I don't like is the cliffhanger. I watched Vagabond in June 2020 and I wrote this in July 2021. Seriously, how long does it take for us to know what happened?

It is an action drama. I am not looking for a great story. I need action at a good pace, beautiful fighting scenes and tolerable actions. The fighting scenes are not necessarily new but they are good enough to entertain me and make me want to see more of them. Having said that, I won't comment much about the story.

Lee Seung Gi is definitely working hard for this. Later I learned more about him and I got to better appreciate his work in Vagabond. His movement, expression and body language feels right. As for Bae Suzy, in early scenes, I underestimated her role. As the stories continue, I grow to like her character and how she portrayed Go Hae Ri. That first scene where she drove and entered the meeting room is stuck in my mind, even after a year. Such a simple scene but it set the tone for Go Hae Ri. The chemistry between the two is visible. I like them.

I can't comment about the music. None that I can remember. That's not really a good sign, no?

I have rewatched this a couple of times, sometimes just some episodes. That tells how much I like it. I don't think this applies for many people though. But yes, watch it if you are a fan of LSG or Bae Suzy. This is a good action movie to binge watch after finishing a deadline.

First watch: 15 July 2020

I watched this drama after binge watching about 30 other top Korean dramas recommended on the internet and this one really blew my mind. I am not even a real big fan of action dramas so it's amazing how Vagabond left a big impression. It's quite the masterpiece. The storyline and acting quality is top notch. This is not an average Korean drama and is most definitely on par with a Hollywood blockbuster. Fast paced and intense, every episode leaves you wanting to watch the other. It is also easy to recommed this drama to anyone (male or female) who has not watched k dramas because it has something for everyone (romance/ action/ suspense).

Absolute Thrill Ride Despite Flaws!
When it comes to a series that has all of the twists and turns, the action sequences, and the intrigue like ""24,"" you really can't go wrong with ""Vagabond.""

Much like ""24,"" nothing in Vagabond is as it seems. Characters aren't as they appear to be, and those that you figured to be the ""villains,"" you suddenly find everything turned around.

A Korean airliner is taken down by terrorists, and the absolute distraught uncle, Cha Dal Geon, is determined to find out why as well as who is behind it. Of course, at first, nobody believes him until small pieces begin to fall into place. Geon is given some credibility as a movie stuntman who also teaches martial arts classes. However, he quickly finds out that martial arts rarely beats out a special forces soldier. I liked that they put some limitations on Geon. However, I was occasionally frustrated by how he took the lead in NIS investigations. That part was lacking in realism. I understand that he has a vested interest, but I doubt that NIS would give him such free reign and latitude. Still, Lee Seung-gi brings a character with a lot of charisma as well as genuine feeling to the role. He was excellent.

Go Hae Ri is the ""rookie"" NIS agent stationed in Morocco. I had a harder time with her character. Suzy Bae is a good--but not great--actress. She seemed to find a hard time treading the line between depicting an agent who is inexperienced but trained. There were times when I just didn't find her depiction believable. I was hoping more for a seasoned actress like Doona Bae (Stanger) who brings intelligence and presence to her roles. Half the time Go Hae Ri doesn't seem to know what she's doing. And too often, she took a backseat to Geon, when she is the field agent! If you're stationed in Morocco as a field agent, you can't be that green. I thought the writers could have done a better job here. Bae also needs to broaden her range. Too often, she has an almost blank expression or the same expression in most of her scenes. I also quickly tired of her ""16-year-old"" reactions to the small, intimate moments with Geon. If there is a ""weak link"" in the cast, it's definitely Suzy Bae!

There were a number of character errors in the series. Never implement a character error in order to move the plot. That's a rookie mistake, and it was used several times in this series to the point when you can't help but shake your head at such carelessness.

Several times, Go Hae Ri or Geon would return to their homes even when they know that they are targets. Do you really think an NIS agent would make this kind of a mistake?

There was an instant when Go Hae Ri is assigned to protect Geon. She's drugged and knocked out. When she comes to, she immediately goes to the bathroom rather than checking to see if Geon is in danger...or even worse, not knowing if the assassin is even still in the building! If she has enough state of mind to easily make her way to the bathroom, I doubt she was disoriented.

Another instant is when we have a sniper trying to take out a target. Geon and Hae Ri are protecting him. We already know that the sniper has orders to kill anyone, including Geon and Hae Ri. And yet, a professional assassin decides not to shoot them in order to kill her target?! I don't know many assassins who have such a conscience. It made no sense.

I also wondered if male prison guards are allowed to work at female prisons in Korea.

In any case, don't let these minor flaws prevent you from watching this adrenalin-boost of a series! There's scarcely a dull moment, and the rest of the cast, especially Kyeong-Yeong Lee (Edward Park) is nothing short of fantastic! I've seen him in several other series, and he's always tremendous!

What really got me, however, was the season-ending cliff-hanger! So unlike most of the Korean series I've seen where I now have to wait for Season 2! I absolutely can't wait!

Hai zoombies
Fasten ur seat belts r tie ur shoe lays.... Absolutely u were going to be in race while watching this drama...
But please don't watch the drama with ur logical mind like machine gun is superior then normal gun...
Some plot r predictable , but it will also lead confusion... So go with flow without thinking...
Eventhough it's triller, action and crime i personally found this as fantasy and supernatural where our hero won't be killed by machine gun, bomb, car crash, shooting , fire .... Lol.......hahaha... (He won't die if lighting directly strike itself . )
But u can enjoy it ...... It holds many twist and turns..major drawback is ending . it was very worst cliffhanger of all... I really want enemies to be punished by our immortal hero... At ending i screamed loud ""WTF...why did i invest my 16 hours to deserve this cliffhanger ending?????? Let's hope for season2 ""........
I hope for next season... There should be... Chaebolllll....
U will enjoy while watching this action , crime triller combo with gud casting...

Excellent thriller with Bond-worthy moments...
Vagabond is an action-packed thriller with a twist in each episode that’ll keep you on the edge of your seats. The two leads are well cast both excellent and have good chemistry, and production value is high. The Moroccan scenes are stunning specifically the roof-top chase scene in ep1 which is Bond-worthy.

Lee Seung Gi is excellent as Cha Dal Gun, a hapless stuntman turned accidental hero. Even though it is hard to believe Dal Gun could escape the numerous and relentless attempts on his life by trained assassins and mercenaries, Lee is convincing because he plays it straight. He doesn’t play it as a thrill-seeker or someone looking for recognition; instead he’s a grieving uncle driven to uncover the truth behind the plane crash that killed his nephew.

Bae Suzy is also excellent as rookie NIS agent Go Hae Ri who reluctantly helps Dal Gun because of her sympathy for the bereaved families in particular Dal Gun’s after seeing his nephew Hoon’s affectionate video. Moon Woo Jin is an intelligent young actor and his Cha Hoon is sweet and has an old soul.

The series ends where it began and while the Dal Gun and Hae Ri appear to be nearing the truth, the mystery is unsolved. Will there be a second season? While I personally don’t believe there’s enough material for a full second season and it’ll be very hard to keep the quality of the story-telling and action to the same level, I hope there’ll be another 2-3 episodes to bring the story to a logical end and give viewers some closure.

I’m still relatively new to kdrama having only watched a handful. And this show was reasonably good.
Starting off with the story, the concept was really good. But the execution was extremely poor and this was the only major drawback of the show. It starts off with a stuntman trying to find out the cause of his nephew’s death with the help of a bunch of NIS agents. He is a stuntman but still, the action scenes shown the show are way too exaggerated for a stuntman to pull off, I mean you can’t just write whatever you want in the script and expect the audience to just accept it. Don’t get me wrong, the action scenes were brilliant, just the dynamics behind them were an issue. Now the main issue where the plot holds weak is, how in the world is the stuntman just being allowed to do whatever he wants involving the NIS. Can they just accept the stuntman carrying out his own investigation and do nothing about it? Not just that, they infact start aiding him with the work after he just imposes himself onto them. And here begin the plot devices. There’s a plot device in almost every other scene. I don’t want to name them cuz I’m trying to keep this review as spoilerless as possible. Everything happens in the show too conveniently.
Coming to the characters, another place where the show is lacking. The characters are not well made. And there’s very little to no development in characters throughout the entire show. The protagonist remains the same aggressive thick headed guy who just barges into works done by others on the basis of getting revenge and justice. The female lead’s character must’ve been annoying to many and she was annoying in many places, but this was one of the few characters in whom we see some development in the entire show.
Acting was a positive part of the show. The actors were all decent in their roles. I have read a lot of criticism about Suzy’s performance but I thought she did fine. It’s her only show that I’ve watched so I can not compare her previous works but she was fine in how she acted, probably a little scope for improvement in the seriousness of her role. The main lead in the show was good, and all the other side actors were decent with their performance. I guess nobody was eye catching and awe inspiring but there’s nothing much to criticise either.
Coming to the music, I know it wasn’t the kind of music where we go and listen to it over and over again, but I thought it was certainly music that suited the scenes to perfection. Especially the action and thriller scenes. The songs were fine as well.
Inspite of all this, I’m still giving this show a 7 cuz it is extremely engaging and doesn’t get overloaded(This is the greatest positive in the show). The episodes were not at all monotonous, unlike in memories of Alhambra, where there’s the same style of achronological direction of the episode. Every episode is engaging and the pace is maintained which only dropped towards the later episodes like 14-16. And the show had a decent timing of humour and Other such moments which didn’t seem all too forceful. This made the show the perfect binge material. Coming to the romance, this was fine in the starting half of the show where it didn’t seem forceful at all. But towards the part where the pace slowed down, it gets really awkward and forceful. Another positive that I noticed was that there was not a lot of usage of emotional scenes in the show to manipulate the audience.
Overall I would like to conclude saying that it’s a very good show if you keep your mind switched off regarding the excessive plot devices used. It’s the perfect material to binge over a weekend. Hope this was helpful.

I have tried Vagabond after seeing so many great reviews, and I have to say that I am not at all disappointed. In the first episode, it started off comedic in the first half of the first episode, and then the story suddenly started with the crash of B357 aircraft.

The story caught up on me from the very beginning, and the cliffhangers just kept me coming for more and more. The action is quite amazing and the fight choreography is also good, except I didn't like the excessive use of shaky cam, it threw me off so often. The music is great to listen to and the acting is, I would say good enough to watch without any problems. The lead of course screams so often, not sure if it is over the top or whether he is just venting off by screaming.

Oh and note that the story doesn't end at the end, in fact, it just opens up more corruption within the country. So I really hope there will be a second season.

Did I just watch a true-to-life movie series?
I. Story
Overall, the story was great. The number of twists and turn, unexpected revelations, the high level political game, and the multiple layers, made this series one of the best crime drama of this decade ('10s). However, it failed closing the story properly.

In the last episode (16th), it was obvious it was rushed. There was no direction. Everything the series built up from episodes 1 to 15 disappeared. It started awesome, then became great, good, and ended poorly.

It is common among creative writers to have an open-ended story but in this case the ending was not an open-ending, no, it was a cliffhanger intended to be a premise for a guaranteed Season 2. If the intention was to have an open-ending, it should have ended with them driving to the airport. Everything else after that scene killed what made it great.

I still give it 8 out of 10 stars for the story regardless of the disaster after the ""driving to the airport scene"". I also applaud the writers and director for not inserting romantic scenes just because their lead female is well-known for it.

II. Acting
Suzy did well in portraying an intelligence officer. This was a big change from her usual romantic roles and I wasn't expecting she can pull it off. Yet, in the first two episodes, she already shone in her role, that's a sure sign of a talented actress.

The acting of the other actors were superb. I usually see them in dramas about family and relationships, seeing them portray political and intelligence roles was refreshing and in they owned the characters they portrayed in series.

Together, the acting were too believable I kept thinking I was watching a fictionalised true story. The characters were too real, all thanks to their acting and synergy.

III. Production
Did I just watch a 16-episode (16-hour) movie? It was clear they spent money on Vagabond to get it all right. But in the last episode the explosions were very bad. This was the other reason why I said earlier that anything after the ""driving to the airport"" scene should not have been included.

IV. Overall score
All things considered. I give it a rating of 8 out of 10 stars. The superb acting and quality production were what pulled it up, and for avoiding creating romantic scenes just because they have a great romantic-genre actress as a female lead.

A series I'll watch again in the future but not the scenes I mentioned earlier.

Exciting and explosive
Wow — this is hands down, the most heart-pounding, stress-inducing drama I've watched. From the very first episode, I was super invested in the backstory and in the backgrounds of the two main leads. This was, in a sense, the perfect underdog story — the ""us against the world"" vibe runs throughout all the episodes in the best way. Especially in the first half, the pacing of the story was perfect; it was fast-paced and we were finding new developments all the time. In term of plot points, this is a drama that really requires you to suspend disbelief — I've seen a lot of reviews saying that it became hard to believe, but in my opinion that's just the nature of a conspiracy thriller and I found myself still able to immerse myself completely in the story. There are some political and financial aspects that I was a little less interested in, maybe a little confused by, but in the bigger picture it didn't hinder my enjoyment of the series.

Even with the insane plot, it was really interesting how this drama still managed to get its laughs and rom-com moments in. The chemistry between the leads is really great, and I love how their personalities meshed together even amidst all the tragedy.

With all that being said, however, I think this drama desperately needs a second season. The ending leaves a lot to be desired, especially since the last few episodes packed a lot of new information that wasn't explained and also changed a lot in the dynamic between our two leads. As much as I loved everything I already watched, it really leaves me craving more — and it feels almost as if I only watched three-fourth of a drama.

Lots of Acts, Unbelievable Story...and Suzy!
I think I laughed more during this serious drama than any other one I have watched. The story was so far fetched and so many twists and turns that it was hard not to shake your head. How most of the main cast did not die in all those different violent scenarios was so unbelievable. With that said, I really did enjoy this series. There was plenty of action, and although mostly all over the top, it made for very entertaining viewing, Isn't that what most action movies are like- highly unlikely scenes, unbelievable stunts and explosions. I was never bored or turned off, even during the most outlandish scenes.
For some reason, this drama reminded me of one of my all time favorites, Descendants of the Sun. The feel and location filming gave me the same vibe. Very effective method to pull you in.
Lastly, got to give it up for Suzy...she is awesome! This is my 2nd Suzy series- finished Start Up a couple of weeks ago and I thought she was great in that. This was a different role of course, throwing Suzy in many physically demanding scenes. I think she pulled them off in a great way. I am going to watch her past series to get more of this great performer.
probably been over 3 years since i switched to Asian Dramas and i still haven't tired yet. I look forward to seeing even more entertaining shows.

Action series
Great show lots of action and suspense, acting very good. A bit slow in the middle. Some good fighting scenes and some not so realistic car chases and bullet scenes.
If you are an action oriented person watch this series.
I usually watch a few episodes at a time, but this one popped in my Netflix preview and I clicked on it. After watching the first episode i was hooked as the story is intriguing. Did binge watch this series it's worth it.


Spoiler:
Where or when is second series, the cliffhanger at the end indicates a second season. With so many unanswered questions the second season is required.

Nearly perfect
Not gonna lie, this was my second try to watch Vagabond, first time, one year ago, I’ve just watched first episode any for some reason decided to drop it. I don’t really know why, probably I was just not in a mood to watch action drama. This time, I’ve made it past first episode and that was one of best decisions I’ve made this year, I swear. This drama has everything and in perfectly balanced proportion. There’s action, drama, romance, even a bit of comedy, just name it.
Story is simple at the beginning and then throughout the series it gets more and more complicated. Cha Dal Geon, our main character takes care of his nephew when the boy dies in an airplane crash. Dal Geon is devastated but soon discover that a simple plane crash might’ve been a terrorist attack. He allies with Go Hae Ri, young agent for NIS and together they try to solve the case which will take them to the very top of Korean politics.
First of all, the plot that we get is from the start very multilayered. Very quickly we’re introduced to vast array of characters that represent both sides of the conflict, so we have broad view of the situation. This gives us more or less full picture of what’s going on on the surface. Because the case quickly turns out to have a lot of layers that we’ll expose them together with main characters.
I’ve quickly put my attention to the characters. Of course, there’s a lot of action, but the characters build the scenery here very well.
So we have Cha Dal Geon and Go Hae Ri, our main characters who in fact know the least of what’s going on, but are in the middle of the action and they are the reason plot moves forward.
Then we have, let’s call it, second circle, where I’d put Gi Tae Ung, who appears first with security audit when things start to get hot in NIS and Min Jae Shik, Hae Ri’s direct supervisor. They both represent group that’s in the middle. They know a bit more than Hae Ri and Dal Geon, but are often limited by their bosses. Right away we get where they stand on the moral compass. Gi Tae Ung may be stickler to the rules of an asshole type of guy since the beginning, but he’s kind of right. He doesn’t trust Hae Ri, which he admits openly multiple of times, but he has s good reason to do so. She shortly proves that she cannot in fact be trusted in this line of work by giving all the information to the Dal Geon, who is certainly out of the investigation, as he’s in no way connected to NIS. She’s too impulsive and in this line of work this is not a trait to be proud of (especially in the eyes of her supervisors) since it may mean risking somebody’s life. By the way, I love Shin Sung Rok’s (playing Gi Tae Ung) acting in this series. His character is not completely good, but in his rough honesty there’s very interesting, true to his beliefs character.
And we have the highest circle, characters that we should be the most beware of. They include villain but also the higher ups in NIS hierarchy. We soon discover that even among “good guys” there’re some shady figures.
As the plot is multilayered with characters it’s also multilayered in terms of action. Viewer doesn’t get rest for long here. Crime in this drama has so many layers, that after uncovering one, another one emerges.
And there’re some comedic reliefs as well. In drama with so much suspense and action, they work as a good pressure valve. It was nice to see infantile rivalry between Dal Geon and Tae Ung in some scenes. It wasn’t pushy or important motive, but it was an interesting add on that took a bit of pressure in a rather action packed series.
Let’s talk about acting, because this was for me drama of reception for some actors. I’ve already mentioned Shin Sung Rok, who’ve done amazing work with Gi Tea Ung.
With Bae Suzy I’ve had initial problem, because I’ve first seen her in Big. The drama was so bad and poorly written that I’ve wanted to forget about everything that I’ve seen there, including Suzy’s acting. Since then I’ve seen her in While You Were Sleeping and Start Up but finally here, in Vagabond I’ve regained trust in her acting, she delivered perfect portrayal of her character.
About Lee Seung Gi. Well, my first encounter was in King 2 Heart, which I still remember with a dose of cringe. His acting wasn’t that bad there, actually he was one of good elements of that drama. Here, with better written character, he truly shined, and I’m so happy about it.
Overall I have absolutely not his bad to say about vagabond. Everything, from music, through characters to the plot was on its place as it should be. Viewer get’s a solid dose of action with strategically placed comedic motives. Absolutely perfect. With one exception, so far there’s no news about second season. And that’s very bad.

10/10 K-drama. That's it. This action drama is really really good! Everything in this drama will make you feel thrilled, cry, and think at the same time! and THE TWIST!! Omg I didn't expect it. I thought I already know what may happen in the next episodes but I was wrong! EVERYTHING IS PERFECT!! The songs, the actors, the characters, the plot, the scenes, EVERYTHINGGGG~ Definitely one of my favorite drama that I've watched this 2021! Watch it guys! Yes, the ending is not that satisfying but in my opinion this drama is not enough for season 1 only. Definitely needs a second season to give a better understanding and a better downfall for the villain in this story. And to justify the death of the victims of the flight B357. So yeah I still think the ending is perfect.

Definitely worth it and yes, I'll recommend this drama for you to watch.

I think most viewers are still at a great withdrawal stage because the show was frustratingly not given a proper closure this time. In fact it doesn't seem like an ending by any means, rather the beginning of a new arch. That being said, if this was a story written with a more tight plotline, it could have been nicely concluded in a 16-20 episode which becomes the biggest reason I'm able to score this a perfect 10, since the main story can stand as an independent stand-alone, and the extension of it is really more of an allowable addition. It's all about the choice of execution here, folks.

Now, onto the story. I must say this is easily one of the BEST dramas ever produced in South Korea because the story is as amazingly driven by the plot as it is by the characters. It's already given in the summary that the reason Cha Dal Geon is involved in the plane crash investigation was his sole purpose to avenge on his nephew's death. We were given enough backstory and emotional flashbacks about the close relationship between Cha Dal Geon and his nephew, as well as his headspace (or really, the lack thereof) which made him jumped right into chasing down the terrorists without any fear. In that sense, Cha Dal Geon is a very straightforward character whose actions not difficult to predict and has stayed in his elements in most parts of the drama, basically kicking ass, killing the bad guys, surviving terror attacks and more.

Ki Tae Woong on the other hand, is the complete opposite to Cha Dal Geon, being the smart and calculative NIS investigative team leader who lays out plans properly before jumping into them. Together with Go Hae Ri who I think was given the most interesting character development in the show, they make a really fantastic trio. Go Hae Ri started off in the show as the NIS agent who was transferred to Morocco for an undercover mission and was admittedly at times frustrating to watch for the ways she was easily overtaken by Cha Dal Geon. Nevertheless, as she became more entangled with the terror attacks, slowly she became more trustworthy in the eyes of her superior to carry out more difficult tasks, and has managed to rise above them with the help of Cha Dal Geon.

Suzy, Lee Seung Gi and Shin Sung Rok have utterly delivered both the strong and subtle nuances of their characters with incredible finesse, that in this drama you no longer see the actor but the characters that these people breathe themselves into. Contrary to some criticisms, not a single moment in the show where I've seen Suzy given us bad acting (even her crying scenes are wonderfully done), rather a perfect fit for how the characters should have been acted according to the story's writing at that time.

Aside from the fantastic trio, there are another five sub-plot devices driven by its supporting characters that make this drama complex and thrilling yet so incredibly written. First is the dynamics between the powerful people at the Blue House, second is the constant confrontation and power play by the NIS chiefs, third is the conflict between Jessica Lee and Edward Park representing their respective companies, fourth is the involvement of the other bereaved family members of the plane crash victims and fifth is the funny interaction/bickering between Lily and The Unkillable guy (hired assassins).

Overall, Vagabond is the perfect action drama given the romance sequence doesn't water down the main plot, and was only splashed in between the scenes. They are not overbearing and the romance build-up was rather slow and steady, therefore you cannot help but root for them. Love is given a very special context clue in here, in that even without having to confess your actual feelings, suppressing them in the hope of protecting your loved one is already a devoted act of sacred love by itself.

The soundtracks are outstanding too, and really added a fantastic touch to the action sequence and emotional scenes. My favourites are titled Breaking Dawn and Open Fire.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this one mainly because the plots are engaging, action sequences fantastically choreographed and directed, and characters perfectly cast. I read Lee Seung Gi's interview for this role and the director imagined correctly that he is the perfect fit for the half-headed, reckless image of Cha Dal Geon, as well as Suzy who portrayed accurately the transition of a half-hearted NIS agent into a full-blown femme fatale. I also found my new girl crush in this, that is Park Ah In. My girl is unapologetically sassy and badass as the female assassin, it's so hard not to fall in love!

This is definitely one of the most intelligent screenwriting I've seen off late, and paired brilliantly by outstanding directing on the part of the director/action director. The hard work they put onto the show really shows and pays off brilliantly in this one, and you are definitely jumping in for a hella good ride.

Enjoy!

This Episode 9 of Vagabond really blew my mind. I mean, the fight scenes are superb and especially the shifting of characters that you dont know what are they up too.. The Production team is a big one! The actors really carried out their persona to the highest level and their owning it. The locations where they shoot are a big production costs and it bring the most out of the story. I dont usually watch Korean Series. But this ONE really hit me! And I always look forward to the next episodes every week but I felt its like a year to wait.. ughhh..

Very fun drama, with very good production value. Story is nothing too new, with your typical agent drama and government corruption storylines, but the characters are fun and fairly well fleshed out. Nothing much in the way of silliness, just a good action drama that is up there among the best of them.
Though I'm a bit disappointed to find out that this is a multi-season drama. Part of the reason I watch far more k-drama than American shows is that American shows are too long to keep up with and they never know when to end, until eventually to the point where they end up sucking. Most k-dramas, on the other hand, have a set ending at about 16 or 20 episodes. They are easy to get into and can be very satisfying when the writer knows where they want to end it and knows to do so within that singular season frame. Kind of stinks that the trend is going toward multi-season now. There is also so much uncertainty with multi-season, like the possibility of never finishing if the drama wasn't popular enough (which I know is not the case with this one). Or even if it was popular, we may not see another season for another five years. Looking at you Signal. *sigh*
Yes, this was more of a rant than a review, but felt compelled to. Anyways, great fun drama that is highly recommended if you don't mind waiting who knows how long until it will eventually conclude.

Well... I decided to watch this drama for two reasons: action, and Bae Suzy acting.
Firstly, I would like to say that I've enjoyed this drama. It had a really nice plot and seemed to head somewhere. In my opinion though, at some point the pace of a story became too fast and it was hard to keep up with the storyline.
Luckily, the cast didn't dissapoint me. The way relationships were created is the best thing about this drama. As I expected, I was amused by Bae Suzy. I also appreciate Lee Seung-Gi acting in this drama.
Sountrack makes another advantage. I actually love it. The two song appearing with the end credits - ""Breaking Dawn"" and ""Open Fire"" are my favourites.
Summarising, I've docked my rating due to the not-the-best plot twist.

If you like action, it may be worth a watch
Finished the show in a week! It was an entertaining show, and I enjoyed the action sequences. I definitely don't buy that a stuntman is better than trained special forces and practically invincible, but this drama isn't about the realism anyways haha There are many twists and turns, but also a tad predictable if you are a fan of similar shows or movies. Mostly fun to watch, but not a show that will have me thinking about it for long afterwards.

Ending didn't anger me as much, but I was getting less invested as drama progressed and knew it would be open ending. What was annoying is final scenes were exactly the same as the beginning...felt lazy like was there really a need to start with those scenes? I think they should've shown less at the start for a more impactful ending.

I CAN't believe that there's season 2!!! I'm not mad and such but I was actually wasn't expecting to have another season. But! WHEN!! when's SEASON 2!!
HOLY THE ENDING MADE ME CRY SO MUCH!
this is my first time watching a Korean drama with less romance in an action drama and I actually like it. There is romance and such but little but I still like how they incorporated it even though the main focus is action.
Omy!! It took me a while to finish this drama because I don't like to wait every week for the episode and right now I am watching Crash Landing On You and I am loving it. But I'm scared I might stop again cuz I might get lazy to wait HAHA.
But anyway, sorry for the spoilers but I recommend this to someone who loves ACTION, TRILLERS, and PLOT TWIST.
It's so GOOD!! <3

Where should I start?!

Okay before starting this show I had mixed feelings about it but as the story progressed with each episode I was hooked to this show.
The best part it's not just typical Korean Drama; it has all the right elements Story, Cast, Plot, Action, Music.. EVERYTHING is so ON POINT.

Lee Sueng Gi as Dal-Geon and Suzy as Hae-Ri are awesome and I'm in love with them after this show. A phenomenal job done by every actor of this show. With a good amount of humor at the right time and place. Action sequences and cinematography was so top notch that it kept me in a nail biting position throughout.
I really hope we get more shows like this in the future because it just increased the standards much higher.

Lastly, the way they wrapped things up IS SO GOOD everything just fell in place. I'm impressed and so satisfied with the way things ended and I really hope they make Season 2 of this show. WE NEED IT!

P.S The song 'Open Fire' has to be my favorite.

Okay so I saw this coming but I wanted to believe otherwise. Edward park is a conniving bastard and I hope he gets what he deserves, excuse my French.
This was one of the best drama I've watched in a while. I went on a drama hiatus a few weeks ago because I have finals coming up soon and I needed to focus on those instead of dramas so I haven't watched any in a while but I had to break that hiatus because of Vagabond. First of all Lee Seung Gi played Cha Dal-gun like a champ, I was captivated by that character on the first episode. I knew that stubbornness was going to bring him to places and I was right. Lee Seung gi is generally an amazing actor but I think this was hands down one of his best role, it was played amazingly. The drama in general was well written, well produced, the scenes captivating and heart arresting especially episode 12, that was hands down the best episode of the entire drama, they did such an amazing job with that episode. Now I knew eventually those conniving a-holes would turn my Cha Dal-gun into a spycho and I was right. I loved it tho. He became such a badass yo and I think the only person who really understood what Chal was made of was the president when he said ""I don't think you'll be struck dead even by lighting."" My mans is undefeatable and won't go six feet under until he kicks they asses to hell and back. Lowkey looking forward to the second season. As for Edward I knew that evil son of a gun was too helpful, I saw it coming a mile away, especially with Micky but I was living in denial, I really hope Chal ends up kicking his butt to hell like he did with Jerome. I cant' wait to see what's coming but I'm still protesting that ending because it was utter bull.

This is not k-drama as usual. I love this k-drama in action, business, politic, romance, and little bit thriller (for me). I really love the story about the linkage between business and politic, it reminds us about the fact of this fucking life. Business and politic are very close, one each other. It depends on how do you run both of them together that can be run in clean or dirty way.

You may watch this k-drama movie as well and i suggest you to pay your attention from the beginning until the end. Actually, you can predict the next episode if you really have your understanding in each scene (who is the actor, what are they talking about, how is the reaction, etc). Even you can predict who is the real culprit on this case before the episode shows you about Samael.

What i get in this k-drama: sadness, anger, hatred, grudge, emotion, lovable. They got me into sadness even in the 1st and 2nd episode for the citizens, meanwhile anger for business and government politic. Anger, hatred and grudge in next episodes that talking about power and money as the king of life. Emotion and lovable until the end of episode that has shown by Cha Dal Geon, Go Hae-Ri, Ki Tae Woong, and the rest of people that still has justice in their heart.

At the beginning I thought this movie was going to be a drag but i really liked the main cast so I decided to give it a try but oh boy! It was an amazing journey. Their acting was on point and I could totally follow the story from start to finish. It was an amazing drama,I like the way both Main leads are being more ruthless now because it would've been really stupid if they still had remorse after everything that they've been through. I'm looking forward to the next season I hope it comes out better than the first one and also maybe a little more romance from both main leads the first season focused on the action which was amazing but then again a little bit of romance coupled with the action,I'm sure it will be a blast

First off let me just say that I don't watch many action/conspiracy dramas so my experience in this genre is not so extensive. And maybe that's the reason why I was able to enjoy it this much.

I liked the flow of the story and how it kept me guessing, the unpredictable twists and turns, and the emotionally-loaded decisions the main characters had to make.

LSG once again proved his chops as an action star, the stunts were thrilling and tension filled. It was also nice to see Shin Shung Rok as a good guy this time.

I didn't like the actress who played Jessica that much but it was something I could live with.

All in all I found this to be a great drama. The lack of romance didn't bother me at all.

Nope not happening.
You can lookup the plot any where, i wont waste your time here so i will be quick. As the producers say, this show's ending was made with season 2's production in mind and since there is no season 2 or even any confirmation of it, this show lost its worth. Everything was going fine but the climax is super disturbing.

Spoiler *******
Theres a big mistake in the show, if only the lady before dying had told the M.C about the evidence most of the show wouldn't have happened nd i dont see any reason why she couldn't tell him since her life was in danger??? Lol.
This show doesnt deserve this 8.3 rating it currently has.

I usually don't comment while watching a series...
...but this time I am, because I'm hoping that my MDL peers who have seen Vagabond will weigh in on my assessment.
Of course, Lee Sungi is amazing (his patented yelling at someone is in full effect...for reference, see the Gu Family Book), and all the actors are excellent. Except Suzi Bae. I don't know whether it is the script writing, her portrayal of the character, or both. The character seems really out of place for what should be a high-intensity drama. The story is excellent, but the execution of it sometimes seems to vacillate between seriousness, and foolishness. But that's only my view. Maybe something at the end of the series will help me understand why the character and / or her performance is so weak? I hope so.

The Queen Suzy Bae back in action in an epic story that got pushed back a lot of times. First planned to start in may 2019, it was pushed to august, then premiered september 20. Releasing later to have the time to finish is normal and I'm all for it. But if somebody is reading this and haven't watch Vagabond yet, I'm sorry to tell you that the drama has no ending... Like Arthdal Chronicles, The story and the cast are top notch and if you dont mind ""open endings"" (that are just open to criticism in my opinion) then go for it watch it. Nice characters, a love story slowly developing and not pushed down our throats, Showcasing of Morocco (even if they sometime jumpcut from city to city randomly) and many more aspects that I looked forward every time I watched an episode.

A good drama from begining to end, but it does not end so... it pissed me off

Season II, YESSSSS!
I love Lee Seung Gi and Suzy Bae. They both are very talented in their acting skills. I love them playing a tag team of sorts. Vagabond writers, you did great with the storyline. Does this mean that Lee Seung Gi will get more training in Martial Arts, I hope so... his body is surely equipped to do so. Writers I hope you don't try to create that one person who is a jealous crazed person who becomes obsessed with one of the leads. ""The Bereaved"", I wished had better parts in the storyline otherwise those who were in supporting roles all did great. I was going to comment on the ending but when there is a cliffhanger... you know the story will continue in a Season II venture. I am so looking forward and excited to see what Season II has to offer. I hope that the main leads will come back or it will NOT be exciting.

One of the best dramas I've seen. Beautiful shots and the colouring is awesome, I love how the ending and beginning are entangled, and it'd filled with action and plotting. The plot twists makes you wonder who is right and who is wrong. Of course Lee Seung Gi and Bae Suzy are fantastic, but I like the way the drama also gave more than enough screen time to other actors and behind the scene plans at different intervals of the drama. I do wish there was more romance, though you can still tell the affection between the leads. At the end, wonderful story and portrayal, magnificent show.
Can't wait for season 2 XD

For overall I have to give ten/ten and there are whys:
Cast and Acting and story too:Vagabond has Really strong cast. I had known it before Vagabond was on air. Lee Seung Gi and Suzy had worked together before Vagabond and at that time their love chemistry had given me emotions, my heart had wanted to explode, In Vagabond their mistery love is hidden. At the end we can see her crying thinking Geon is dead, They've loved.
Rewatch Value: I wish it had more episodes and action was closed, because why why that ending :(. I really want them to find each other. I am begging for another at least 2 episodes which really can close Vagabond story well.
Music: PERFECT artists= PERFECT soundtack= PERFECT ACTION AND EMOTION GIVEN

Its my first review. There are many good kdramas. I love action series with good story. After Healer nothing matched to its level in action series until now. The direction, action, story, cast everything is really good. The male lead justified the character. Only sad thing is it didn't end in one season and no official announcement regarding 2nd season.I will be waiting for 2nd season. You can watch and wait for the 2nd season though brutal but worth it.

While submitting the review it asked me to make it 500 words. I don't want write anymore. If anybody reads this can recommend good drama worth watching if you are in the mood. I like mainly action thriller but shouldn't be too slow. But i aslo like good rom coms too.

Can't believe I started reviewing just after watching 3 ep. Stroy's gripping from the very beginning and its progress is simply phenomenal.
Though I knew it's a pack of suspense and investigation didn't expect it to have me on the edge of my seat. Stunts are well performed and co-ordinated,
I'm falling In love with the character. having a gut feeling is right but how many of us get to reap the benefits of it? this character clearly reaps them unknowingly(which is evidently necessary for the given circumstances).
