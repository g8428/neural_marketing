       "['The series is about the cases of a judge in a juvenile court who detests young offenders due to events in her past. It is well acted with the background to each case and then the procedures where justice is supposedly served. It has interesting cases but I found it a depressing watch as there was no levity in any of the episodes just poor parents, abused children and horrible events. An interesting series with a strong central character but very little development on the histories of the rest of the cast and lots of information about the workings of the juvenile justice system.',\n",
       " \"It is such laziness that raises the counter argument. One must not let it be, let your guard down, let it slide. Because justice is not only about fairness to the offender, especially the young, but more importantly fairness to the victim.This is a heavy drama. No relief at all. If you don't like that skip it. All cases are supposedly based on real cases. There are some moments of lingering sentimentality. But those can be forgiven for completing the arch of emotions.Recall there were 5 cases, one sidetracked involving a half way house of sorts. Beside the concluding case, I find the school cheating scandal most interesting. Because the show explained how the rich kid cheaters can benefit (and hurt others) even more by dropping out of school. The law have it's limits. This cases also lead to the main backstory and also onto other brutal and organized crimes by the same defenders.Obviously the underage murder is also shocking as to how they thought about deceiving the system.The main lead is tremendously restraint. I especially like how slow, weighted and the preciseness (seemingly as I don't know Korean) of her enounciations. From the get go you know there must be a back story to 'I detest juvenile offenders'Two points taken off for the over righteous concluding speech during the discipline hearing. And heavy focus on the main character. But still excellent.\",\n",
       " \"Ignore the paid-for, planted raves in the reviews here. Watch it for yourself. This is a big step down from other South Korean shows that have graced Netflix lately. It's pure lowest common denominator TV fare with outsized characters, silly situations and bad acting.\",\n",
       " 'I found this series to be very touching, bringing lots of emotions to the fore. It has an important social message concerning the delicacies of raising children in the correct manner. Superb acting with excellent scripts and filmography. All in all it is a very intelligent series well worth watching.',\n",
       " 'This is a serious drama that seeks to look carefully at the good and bad of juvenile justice in Korea. As usual for Korean drama that is achieved via a highly engaging story line that entertains as well as informs.Just occasionally the travails of Judge Sim, the key protagonist, lurch beyond credibility. But the propulsive plot and powerful acting keep you glued and almost succeed in cloaking these moments.Overall a highly rewarding watch that I recommend to everyone who has yet to discover the great strengths of Korean dramas.',\n",
       " \"Brief and unique is all I can say, it all based on real life crime. As a real life crime obsessed I approve that this really is happening to kids that lack of attention from parents/guardian but not all because in some case they're just psycho. I love how director just give 10 episode instead of 16 that make this even more interesting. Good job on this such a fresh ideas on k-drama content!\",\n",
       " \"Good, but i think it's overrated. I would rate it 6/10. I thought it would be better especially after viewing the rating and reading reviews. Good story. Medium acting. Good background music. Season 1 contains 10 episodes.\",\n",
       " \"I stumbled upon this series while scrolling through Netflix, looked into the first episode and it hit me like a truck. Juvenile Justice really came out of left field for me, and in retrospect I'm really thankful for the experience.The story revolves around Shim Eun Seok (Kim Hye-su), a juvenile court judge who appears stone cold and lays down the law with an iron fist on young offenders, while also battling her own demons of the past deep inside. The juvenile justice system is highly divisive, conflicting and heavily overloaded, laying not only the sentencing and punishment of juvenile offenders on the court but even the aftercare and oversight on the judges themselves. While the law treats them as children who are scarcely accountable for their own actions, often it doesn't defend victims or take their circumstances into account, what lead them down this path. Domestic violence, neglect, mistreatment, bullying, often very hard to properly prosecute. On the other hand, many young criminals straight up expect to get off with nothing but probation and a slap on the wrist while committing very real crimes, theft, robbery, blackmail, prostitution, grievous violence and even murder, fully aware of their actions. Judge Shim sails the muddy waters of this tattered legal embroglio to try and truly punish young criminals and bring absolution to the victims of the system.Honestly, I was truly surprised by this series! I half expected a confusing and boring TV schlock, filled with incessant jargon and theatrical melodrama. But what I got was a very intense, high quality, easily digestible (for a legal series), very binge-worthy story and some of the best acting I've seen in a while! Kim Hye-su completely dominates the role of Judge Shim. Coming off as a stone cold, no-nonsense inquisitor who absolutely throws the book at young criminals trying to slip through the cracks, while she slowly learns that the juvenile court is not only there to punish but also to teach, reform and protect those fallen by the wayside and wronged by the system.The production quality is excellent! The camera work, direction and even the few special effects are way higher quality than one would expect from a TV series of this kind. This far excuses some of the plotholes and the sometimes wooden acting by some of the support cast. I usually don't like kids in series and movies, but I have to say, the young cast brings their A-game and believable acting throughout the series, which was really refreshing. The story goes at breakneck speeds, filled with lots of detail, action, intrigue, investigations and hard choices which makes the series feel a lot longer than 10 episodes. There's never a dull moment watching Judge Shim and co going above and beyond their line of duty to get to the truth and render a truly just verdict in the end.All in all, I highly recommend Juvenile Justice to anyone looking for an intense court drama with a flair for complexity and some action on the side!\",\n",
       " \"I don't personally understand all the 10 star reviews, but maybe they understand Korean drama better than me. I really like the premise and the main character, Judge Sim, is intense in a unique way (but almost too much so). The actors, when not screaming or crying, are really engaging. But I'm not a fan of the yelling and over-the-top wailing that permeates each episode. Nor do I enjoy watching young girls constantly getting their hair pulled while being slapped/kicked around- it's almost torture porn-ish. Other than that, interesting storylines, good writing, good production value, and insight into Korean culture are a plus. I also appreciate the messaging that parents need to step up and take care of their children.\",\n",
       " 'ANOTHER UPDATE: I want to make sure someone unfamiliar with Korea is not deceived by this show or some of the information on this board. It seems I also have to define what \"dramatized\" means. The Korean legal system has a special set of laws for kids under 14. That is the main issue the show is trying to tackle. Some of the crimes depicted in the show did happen. However, the show has purposely lowered the age of the criminals to make it more shocking and fit the narrative of \"under the age of 14.\" Lastly, \"NO,\" judges in Korea do not go chasing after suspects. When you take an actual event and embellish it with outrageous details, that\\'s dramatization.UPDATED REVIEW: I\\'ve managed to watch a few more episodes. Unfortunately, I am lowering my rating from an 8 to a 6. While the subject matter is interesting and the acting remains strong, the show fails to deliver on many ends.The drama attempts to tackle a very serious issue that has been at the center of controversy in Korea for a while. The show is stacked with a solid lineup of veteran actors who have demonstrated their acting skills in dozens of works and I have no doubt that they will not disappoint here. Having viewed the first couple of episodes, I do find that the story is somewhat over dramatized. Perhaps the show runners felt that taking a more realistic approach may lessen the entertainment value. I think a more subtle approach may have been more effective in bringing the issue to the forefront of discussion.',\n",
       " 'This series provides a freshness from the court or law series because it provides a new perspective on child crime. Unfortunately, the main character of the judge is too investigative and crossed the line that should be the domain of the police.',\n",
       " 'This series has become one of my favorites, without any effort. I have always appreciated the detective, detective and investigative series, but above all series that take place in court. This series amazed me, the best I\\'ve seen.The protagonist, Judge Shim (played by Kim Hye-soo) is simply perfect, she has a very interesting approach to dealing with \"young criminals\" and gives them the right lesson to grow at their best. The backstories of the various characters are treated very well and manage to make you empathize with each of them, from the protagonists to the tertiary characters.I highly recommend this series, it is very interesting and is perfect for a marathon.',\n",
       " '\"The law can\\'t protect all victims.\" The bitter truth, no matter how much I think unfair it is, but it happens in our reality and this series just depicts the tip of the iceberg on how truly intricate the law is. From the officials to everyone involved in that. Juvenile justice is just so brilliant series that unlike any other legal series, it has that depth of their characters and also talks about young offenders in a way that not only entertain us but also give us some understanding how vulnerable children are that our actions, whether it\\'s good or bad, would affect them greatly.',\n",
       " 'Surprisingly good! For me it was a roller coaster of emotions and even had me shed some tears in some episodes. All the cast did wonderful job acting 👏 👏👏.I saw other comments that said \"bad acting\" and \"medium acting\" and I\\'m asking myself, are they tone-death or did they watch the same show OR did they watch it with English dubbing? Never watch anything with dubbing unless you\\'re doing two things at once. It\\'s never the same!',\n",
       " 'Really fun for the first 2 episodes, after that the level of fun gradually decreases. A series that plays a big story, but when told, there is only water. There is no sharpness of the hot topic of the story left at the end.',\n",
       " 'The best thing about this drama is that they are not \"overly-dramatizing\" the crimes as many are suggesting.On the contrary, these crimes are based on real life incidents that shook Korean society to the core. I still remember about the case where a teenage girl chopped up a young kid and then laughed in the court. This was a real case that happened in South Korea.As this is cinema, it\\'s certainly dramatized but almost all cases are real including the one with throwing up the brick.Kim Hye-soo is at her absolute best.',\n",
       " \"It's very dramatic and emotional series but I like it. The acting is good and it has solid story line. Not boring at all. I'm happy that Netflix Korea has brought another good Korean series.\",\n",
       " 'Damn what a strong (first) season of a show.Let me start by praising the acting within this series. Everybody does such an amazing job, from the court helpers to the victims. Sometimes you\\'ll forget you\\'re watching actors, and the drama hits even harder because of it. Whoever did the casting for \\'Juvenile Justice\\' should get a raise.Considering the subject matter is juvenile criminality, and this series does not hold back the punches at all, prepare to get a bit depressed at times. There aren\\'t always happy endings. Or as the main actress so eloquently put it: \"The law doesn\\'t protect every single victim\". The main characters do their best to put things right though.That everything isn\\'t tied with a bow at the end of every episode makes it more realistic though. Even when they get the bad guys, as one of the court helpers rightly reminds us, the victim is still scarred for life because of what happened. This is not a happy show.It\\'s thrilling though, and emotional, and shocking. It makes you angry, sad and hopefull. It\\'s *beeping* amazing television. This show is totally worth your free time.',\n",
       " 'This show touch all part of case the criminal, the victim, the families. You will see each side of emotions its not just court room darma its journal of emotions. In last episode in few last mints my heart exploded.. the pain of a mother. Kim did a fantastic job ..love her.',\n",
       " 'The series is fast moving although it is only 10 episodes in total. All the casts are excellent in their portrayal of the characters - including the perpetrators and victims. I am impressed with Judge Sim for standing her grounds on her believes in the way the juveniles should be treated to correct their behaviours for the future.',\n",
       " \"I heard Korean dramas are very popular all over south east Asia and especially in China. I'm starting to see why, as all k-dramas I have watched were great (move to heaven, squid game, my name).The characters are shown very well and I could relate quickly. The cases made me think about law and justice. The pace is just right, the story thrilling and touching.Sometimes I'm not sure whether something is Korean culture or individual character e.g. Bosses seem to yell a lot, and there is a strong hierarchy of respect between people, whereas in western culture everyone is more equal, irrespective of age and position (at least compared to as it's shown in juvenile justice). One case is about the education system where I also think some background info would be helpful to research upfront.This left me a tiny bit confused at times.9/10PS: im not criticizing the show for showing Korean culture, just stating it may make some situations seem weird for westerners.\",\n",
       " 'Kim Hye Su delivers her lines with so much conviction and mental prowess her persona alone influences those around her that are morally feeble and need proper cultivation but also rectifies on behalf of those quiet unheard defeated voices at large.',\n",
       " 'When people talk about a show being over dramatized as they call it, they forget that this is not a documentary. This is show business therefore it is supposed to deliver some sort of entertainment. You complaining about the drama shows that they have done a good job. It\\'s not a true crime docu-series. While some aspects of the show could be based on real events (which I don\\'t know and don\\'t seem to care) the fact still stands that this is not supposed to be a real life depiction of anything.Now let\\'s get down to the review:This show is a great catch. It is raw and VERY realistic. For example if you\\'ve watched Devil Judge you know how the main judge Kang was? Vigilante. Basically green arrow without the arrows. This show didn\\'t have any of that nonsense. No rich judge background. No hidden agenda. She didn\\'t go on a wild chase after the kids who murdered her child. She just did her job. She made sure every sentence was just and victims felt the \"justice\"\\r\\nIt was great, the way they walked through the emotions of every character and I can see the show having more than one season because the characters have character.One thing I wish they would have done was give their characters a better backstory and a better ending.So what happened to Kang ? He resigned and then what? He was in so many episodes for them to just eliminate him and give him a cameo in the last episode.The other judge from Busan was great (sorry forgot his name) he had a good backstory BUT what was his ending? When you almost make certain characters the main characters (by giving them so much screen time) they should have a climax. All he said was that he was disappointed but he understood. Then what? What is his ending? If you dont pay close attention you will not find out why he even went to Juvey when he was young.Anyway, these are minor things. A plot can\\'t always be 100% complete. We always miss out certain things as scriptwriters but the script is strong enough to survive the little things.',\n",
       " \"Parents are the GURU not just a teacher for a child. In Bengali parenting is called ' manus kora' which means making of a human being. This series shows us the effect of neglecting the children and also the effect of too much care. This also shows how bad judgment can bring more crimes.Overall this series gives a very good social message.\",\n",
       " \"First time I wrote a review because how good this drama really is. The lead actress acting is really great. Also my first time finishing a K-Drama series.

       " 'Well, it is a shame but it was a real case in Korea few years ago that two juveniles have butchered a little kid. Also it is a serious issue in Korea that the laws and punishments are very weak including juvenile justice. All the episodes were based on real cases in Korea that were major juvenile issues in recent few years. This drama has shown serious issues in Korea and dealt some cases to help people realize that juvenile crimes are not minor crimes anymore but they have become serious crimes. I really wanna say that the actors have done great jobs.And before you judge \"Asian\" dramas for different cultures that you don\\'t understand, I really recommend you to look up their cultures before, after or while you watch them because that\\'s what most Asian people would do when they watch \"Non-Asian\" dramas.',\n",

The great series always leave spaces for its audience to think.Each character has their own storyline and this is very well-delivered by actors. All actors have magnificent skills in delivering lines that could be cringe in a clear and effective way. There is no right or wrong answers in reality, so as the characters\\' belief.

And, if your mother or Father O\\'Reilly drop by, you also might want to think twice before watching this South Korean mini-series with them! You\\'ll see hundreds dies, heads explode and tons of blood....just don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you!In many ways, the show is a lot like the Japanese movie \"Battle Royale\" or the \"Hunger Games\" films...but with one huge exception. Unless the unwilling participants in the other films, the folks in \"Squid Game\" know what they\\'re in for after the first round...and their deaths were because of their greed or situation in life.The film begins by showing you a bit of Seong Gi-hun\\'s life. He (Lee Jung-jae) is a loser in pretty much every way and his gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage. He\\'s deeply in debt to loan sharks who vow to kill him and you have a very hard time feeling sorry for the guy. He\\'s ruined his, his wife\\'s and his daughter\\'s lives.When one of his loan sharks catches up to him, you assume they\\'ll either beat Seong or kill him. Oddly, however, instead they have him sign a paper in blood....and in order to avoid being killed he signs it without hesitation. What he doesn\\'t realize is that by doing this, he\\'s agreed to enter one of the strangest gambling contests ever...if not the strangest.Seong arrives at the location the paper tells him to go to...but why, he isn\\'t sure. Soon a van pulls up and he enters...and is knocked out almost immediately. When he awakens, he\\'s with 455 other participants...who, at this point, have no idea what they\\'re in for with these strangely clad \\'hosts\\'. They are told they\\'re playing a game of Red Light/Green Light...and most of the folks think it\\'s all very childish. However, when the first one moves when it\\'s a red light, snipers kill him!!! Soon, they realize that they\\'d BETTER make it to the goal line before the allotted time or they\\'ll die...and die many of them do.After this \\'game\\', about 200 of them were killed. But here\\'s where it gets interesting. They are then allowed to vote as to whether to finish the game and go home or continue. By only one vote, they vote to go home. Episode two shows them at home...and it\\'s my favorite one of the shows in the series. At this point, most of the remaining players actually decide to return to the game, as many of them face death or prison if they quit the game. The final seven episodes are the continuation of the game...as well as showing the actions of a cop who manages to infiltrate the contest.Again, just to make things clear, this is a mega-violent show....even more so than the \"Fargo\" television series! But I kept watching despite this because the writing was simply exquisite and the characters in the game truly memorable...and in some cases, infamous. It also is exceptional because so much of it is hard to predict! Overall, a film that is different enough from \"Hunger Games\" and \"Battle Royale\" that it really works well. I found it so compelling, I watched the entire series in one evening....though I\\'d only planned on seeing and episode or two.By the way, if you care, the amount won in the contest is a bit more than $38,000,000 US dollars.',\n",
       " \"Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.\",\n",
       " \"Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!\",\n",
       " \"Mixed feelings on this one. The glorification of violence in shows like this tend to be desensitizing and seem to acclimate those with criminal tendencies to head down a wrong path. Yet the challenge of the individual games create a paradox of situations in which the viewer is steered toward thinking that certain players will work together, only to find they are pitted against each other, as in the marble game. The horror of that game was brought forth when a married couple naively decided to work together, only to be faced with the grim reality that there could only be one survivor. These kinds of situations were prevalent throughout the series episodes, making it almost impossible to know who would survive at the final outcome. Through it all, I believed there was something noteworthy about the old man, player #1 (Hideo Kimura), who's physical resemblance to an aged Korean Billy Crystal impinged on my brain every time I saw him (go back and see what I mean). Oddly, for such a large cast of characters, there weren't any that I could really connect with in a meaningful way. Perhaps the closest was player #240, young Ji-yeong (Vivian Lu, incorrectly identified in the credits as Sae-Byeok), eliminated in play when partnered with player #67 Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Hoyeon). Tied for most despicable characters were player #101 Deok-su (Paul Nakauchi) and player #212 Han Mi-neo (Stephanie Komure), so it was appropriate that they should be eliminated together in the Glass Stepping Stones game. The ending here seemed a little superfluous considering all that went before, with the old man Il-nam wagering a final personal bet against Gi-hun (Greg Chun), player #456, and winner of the grand prize of 45.6 billion won. Doing the conversion, that came to just under thirty nine million dollars, and seeing all those big numbers can really disorient the viewer. When Gi-hun paid the flower vendor at the end of the story a ten thousand won note for a single bunch, it seemed awful generous, until doing the math revealed it was about eight dollars and fifty cents.\",\n",
       " 'Even if you\\'ve seen \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Money Heist\", \"Squid Game\" (called \"Ojing-eo Geim\" in the original Korean) is still going to shock you. The sad thing is that so many people have no other choice but to risk everything like the characters here.Definitely see it. You\\'ll never look at any children\\'s game the same way again after seeing it.',\n",
       " \"This runaway hit from South Korea is centred on Seong Gi-hun, a heavily indebted man who is invited to take part in a series of six games that if he wins will solve his problems. He accepts gets into a vehicle where a gas puts him to sleep. When he wakes he is in a large facility with over four hundred other people; they are watched over by masked armed guards. Here they are told the rules, one of which states that if a majority of players want to quit the game will end but they will not get any prize money. As they play the first game, the school yard game 'red light green light' they quickly learn that being eliminated is quite literal with losers being shot on the spot! Over the course of the series Gi-hun gets to know various other contestants; some he befriends and forms a team with for certain games; others are quickly identified as a danger. As the games continue more and more people are eliminated. While this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.When I saw this recommended on Netflix I thought I'd watch it sometime but was in no great rush as I assumed to would be a Korean 'Alice in Borderland'. After hearing talk of its popularity I thought perhaps I should watch it sooner. I'm glad that I did. I really liked 'Alice in Borderland' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. The games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. The characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. The programme's design is impressive; I especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. The cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.\",\n",
       " 'Everybody has been talking about \"Squid Game.\" I\\'ve been seeing memes and costumes, and I was in the dark. I didn\\'t feel compelled to watch it at all because I generally don\\'t watch T. V. shows. I found that any show can make one or two good episodes, but then I begin disliking every character after a while. I broke down and watched \"Squid Game\" at the constant urging of my wife and to me it\\'s meh.To me it\\'s a Korean \"Hunger Games.\" I know that there are some big differences, but it\\'s still people playing deadly games for a prize. What has drawn in so many viewers is the fact that adults are playing kids games with deadly consequences. Of course, there has to be some exposition and character development in a nine episode show with each ep being an hour, but what we\\'re all there to see is who will survive and who will be eliminated. Like those who go to NASCAR races for the crash.Maybe it\\'s a victim of its own hype, but I wasn\\'t that impressed. There were some impressive moments such as the first game they played and the pure shock of it all, and maybe even episode six when choosing partners put them in a position many of them didn\\'t want to be in, but I will say that some of the \\'umph\\' is taken out of a show when you know that anyone without a significant speaking role is definitely dying before any main character. I\\'ve labeled this spoiler so I\\'ll say this: when you have a tug-o-war game with just about every main character on one team it\\'s a dead giveaway that they\\'re going to win no matter how weak and frail they look.So, to \"Squid Game\" I say \"Meh.\" Only one character was halfway exciting or fun to watch and the side stories didn\\'t interest me enough. If \"Squid Game\" were four episodes instead of nine I think it would\\'ve been a lot better. That being said, I\\'m committed now. I would like to see what happens in season two.',\n",
       " \"Exciting show that keeps you watching. The Korean part is the emotional connection with the characters and their financial problems and how they have family obligations. The violence although comically exaggerated is unusual for a K drama. Good acting from LSJ and PHS veteran actors. Striking set design gives it a visually glossy look. Whatever makes international audiences watch K dramas is good. This isn't a typical K drama and far from one of the best. But it's a swift watch.\",\n",
       " \"I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next.\",\n",

At his lowest ebb, he finds himself approached by a man at a train station, who offers to take care of his financial woes if he agrees to participate in a secretive ritual. With no choice but to accept, Seong finds himself plunged, with a group of others, in to a nightmarish, garish battle for survival.Korean cinema has enjoyed some recent worldwide acclaim, with cult hits such as Parasite and The Platform leaving quite an impression. But this year it's enjoyed this again in a TV format, with this mind-bending visceral blow from writer/director Hwang Dong-hyuk. It's sheer outrageousness and visual astonishment is enough to leave an impression, and even sparked some copycat behaviour around the world, with reports of people reenacting some of the 'games' portrayed.It comes together like a fusion, of the wildest excesses of the most fantastical Phillip K Dick novel, and the most blood thirsty Quentin Tarantino film, with a fairly standard format of a group of strangers being thrown together to fight for survival, which has been portrayed in films such as Cube. Like the aforementioned films, there seems to be some societal commentary thrown in, such as increasing poverty and the gap between rich and poor, as well as the depths 'reality TV' could sink to in the name of 'entertainment.'It's definitely been the runaway hit of 2021, that's left quite an impression, and gained quite a cult status, that, in spite of its excessive gruesomeness, can safely be said to be earned. ****\",\n",

The storyline follows people who choose to play child's games competitively for money that could change their life forever. Shortly after they arrive they discover the price for losing is rather expensive. This series was directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk (The Fortes and My Father) and stars Lee Jung-jae (New World), Park Hae-soo (Time to Hunt), Oh Yeong-su (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring) and Jung Hoyeon (100%: Beat). The storyline for this series is very unique and was a creative spin on similar films like Battle Royale, Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies. The concepts were well thought-out and paced and the characters are very well developed. The storyline and characters evolve well throughout the series. The games and settings are amazing and they used great colors and cinematography to present each scenario. The costumes and props were obviously outstanding as well. My one complaint was the main character who was painfully annoying throughout the series and completely ruined the end for me. The gore and kill scenes in this are unique and very well done. I'd score this series a 7.5/10 and would consider it an absolutely must see.\",\n",

The idea or concept is also nothing really new: Stephen King aka Richard Bachman, The Long Walk and The Running Man, or movies like Battle Royal, The Hunger Games, Death Race, Circle, Cube or 13 and many more precede Squid Game.

It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them.

Luckily, this anti-capitalist idea is not overhanging too much. The number of episodes could be less, but some good twists in the final one elevated the thrill that began to fade away in e.g. Episodes 7 and 8.However, the performances are interesting, so different for the Western ones, how they react and how they depict, with men more versatile though.

Borders in a sense have been broken, coincidentally in a time when a virus physically forces them to close.This show was thought provoking and makes you ask really think about life in general. We're all trying to get rich. But being rich doesn't buy happiness nor does it buy you health.\",\n",
       " 'This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.It uses \"Hunger Games\" as it\\'s base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of \"actors\" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it\\'s meant to be!',\n",
       " \"So, having heard much about this show and of course the controversies, I knew I had to give it a watch.The show follows 456 players who engage in child like games in order to win £££ prize money, but don't realise how deadly the stakes for the games are!I found the show to be great for the most part, the games they set for the players are dark and twisted versions of the kids games we all remember from our childhoods, I'm 27 by the way! The sets were good, the characters were good especially the lead and the english dubbing wasn't too bad! The TV Show is gory & dark in a lot of areas & reminds me of the Hunger Games crossed with Saw!The only things that I found were off were the filler parts of the Show, the talking parts, the drawn out scenes all seemed to drag quite a bit, ok character development is a must, but cutting it down & getting to the point is also a must not to mention consistancy!Overall, it's a good Show with a creative premise and good story to follow! The games are creative with their own dark & sinister twist to them! The Show does drag in areas, but is pretty entertaining all the way! Roll on Series 2!7/10.\",\n",
       " 'Squid GameA very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan\\'s Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the \"losers\" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers \"side-hustle\" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the \"real\" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed \"worthless\".The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but \"manga\" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!I\\'m giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers.',\n",

I enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch. I will recommend anyone to watch this TV Show. It was quite good.',\n",
       " \"I don't know if it's a must for Netflix shows to become lame at the very end. It became very far-fetched and melodramatic and Gi-hun signaled virtue the whole time as if he didn't get back to the game while he knew he had to kill people and as if he didn't cheat the old man at the marble game. I wish he just stood up and admitted what he did. His mother died and he helped the mother of the other finalist (that stabbed himself in the neck at the squid game) by giving her the money and then took the North Korean girl's brother from the orphanage and before flying to the US to see his daughter, he called the corporate again to make them pay back. And another thing is that the old man was in fact the Korean Jigsaw in the game. He was rich so he wanted to lose track of time just like he'd do when he was a child so he did all what he did. And he died at an empty flat right before the sleeping old drunk man in the street received help just like Gi-hun. He died a few seconds before midnight as if we needed more far-fetched stuff.I enjoyed the show except for the final episode. The idea and the execution was good and the acting didn't take me out of it except for the actors who play American guests. I like the characters and their background stories. And on top of all this, there's this amazing episode 6 so I rated it 8 out of 10.\",\n",

As soon as the credits rolled on the final episode, I had half a mind to start a rewatch with the new perspective the ending grants.Incredible.\",\n",

       " \"Squid Game isn't easy viewing at all; and I believe that it was meant to make viewers uncomfortable and distressing as all hell, because that's what desperation with life-and-death situations are truly like, and it can actually break who we are as people.456 players, 45.6 billion South Korean won, six games, and only ONE player can come out as the grand champion after everyone else has been killed. To make matters even worse these people were kidnapped off the streets because of their debts to collectors, yet outside the world is far more unforgiving than the brutal takes on classic kid's games.Netflix managed to strike gold with this show, which I guess took off because of the pandemic's devastating effects on ALL of society, and the themes of desperation and survival resonated with anyone and everyone who tuned into this breakaway mega-hit. It got people so invested it became a massive meme, where people parodied the thing, cooked up fan-theories and mocking the show's all-English dub.In spite of the showy production values in Squid Game, the characters are still very much like real people who've got real frustrations, real tension inside them, and very real everyone-for-themselves urgency to their character arcs. Squid Game is still a grounded story in spite of its SELECT sci-fi/spy-fi trappings and comic-book-like iconography with the 'PlayStation Men' and mysterious leader.Squid Game is Netflix's unexpected phenomenon; and I reckon there'll be those who understand and appreciate it and those who won't.Memes or no memes, this is a show definitely worth your time.\",\n",
       " 'Review By Kamal KDark portrayals of greed, low self value and distorted view of reality based on the twisted social standards that are rooted in the obsession over money that takes away all the joy of life - all wrapped in a completely unrealistic scenario sprinkled with dark comedy tone, that emphasizes the absurdity of the characters\\' choices and behaviors.The childlike locations and games present a drastic contract to the brutality of the scenarios the characters are facing. The game creators put themselves in the position of innocent keepers of the rules, and any tragic deaths are the fault of the participants for breaking them. No one is forced to participate - you signed your death certificate yourself.Survival in the game and survival in daily life serve as another good contrast - the physical brutality versus the emotional and existential dread. It\\'s more than survival games drama, the true horror is the reality of these people outside of the games and what they can do in the given situation to change it.Blood and murder are this show\\'s best friends, be aware of that before watching. Realistically speaking, this is not some new higher level of gruesome scenes, but they don\\'t shy away from showcasing deaths and accidents.The acting from all the adults was truly amazing. Like in any drama, some roles had more depth and were more demanding than others, but none of the characters felt like an empty placeholder to fill the scene.But then we had the group of foreign actors with such an exaggerated line delivery, I was thinking I\\'d rather mute the screen. Not one of them did a good job. All sounded like licence free sound bites.Any flaws or complaints?Depends on what you are looking for. Do not expect any elaborate death traps and clever tricks - it\\'s far more simple. It is pure survival with technically simple rules and games. You won\\'t wreck your brain trying to understand what is going on, since the plot is rather straightforward with no unexpected plot twists that turn the whole plot upside down.You might want to sit down and analyze the message of the show and what might be the meaning behind. Depending on the viewer it could be a decent kill count watch with a bit of excitement, or a depressing portrayal of collapsing morals and society, as the money sucks all the joy out of our lives.There has also been a random sex scene, and I don\\'t think we needed that \"final\" nail in the coffin - it was clear even without it that people would do anything for survival and money.Some details make exactly zero sense, and I truly mean zero. If you are lucky, you will not notice them at all, since they are less than minor. Squid Game is not exactly free from plot holes, but none of them have a big impact on the story. Some plot lines do hit the dead end though.Overall, it was a brutal drama, yet somehow I found myself laughing at quite a number of scenes. The dark comedy, calling out the hypocrisy - all that was truly amazing. 2/3 of the show was a solid 9.5, and I\\'m a bit frustrated with where the show went after that. Still, quite an enjoyable watch, with interesting set designs, well written characters and some solid thrills. They were able to get me attached to the characters and feel their desperation and pain.',\n",
       " 'Not sure about all the hype but certainly great fun and slickly made.Nothing really new in the plot.

Direction, cinematography all good. I think Alice in Borderland was slightly more adventurous but this was certainly slicker.A great binge watch!',\n",
       " \"The series takes specific aim at South Korea but it's certainly universal in 2021, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare so many injustices.

       " \"I had fun binging for two days. It's seems like a mashup of the Hunger Games, Saw, Bond villains and wacky Asian reality game show. Very good character development. I felt I knew the characters well halfway in the series. The first two episodes are a little slow, then the show ramps up to speed. The last episode is a tear jerker. The weakest part, as many have said we're the VIPs. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was the screenplay dialogue was poorly written.It's certainly a different kind of watch most Americans are not used to. But that's a good thing. Netflix makes it easier to watch foreign content so that our cultural bobble burst and we get more diversely made content from around the globe.\",\n",

This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special. But yeah, that's my ranking of all the rounds in this first season.\",\n",

       " '\"You don\\'t trust people because they are trustworthy. You do it because you have nothing else to rely on\"Squid Game is thoughtful, provocative, and darn productive in every sense. Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some \\'Masterpiece\\'. Contrary to popular belief, it\\'s not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn\\'t be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I\\'m leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it. Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?',\n",

       " \"Gaming with human lives has been a subject in movies since The Most Dangerous; or even before; any movie about Gladiators was basically about people risking their lives to entertain the public.However, after the worldwide success of PARASITE the subject of social struggle has become preponderant also on the Korean movies.Many from that country like Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Lady Vengeance or Old Boy had lots of references about the social fight ; poor people trying to survive, rich people abusing them; but recently has become the full theme; thus this series.Contrary to expectations; the gore and violence level in the series is not that high; but the drama is.The first 7 chapters is about the people's misery around and why they accept to bet their lives for money. The characters lives are depressing desperate losers and (with one exception) selfish and far from sympathetic; all of them seem to be guilty of their own tragedies.Hundred of people are killed but most of them are unknown or have no empathy. We only get to know only a few of the characters; which will eventually mostly die.The games are not spectacular but the suspense is well crafted.The first problem is that the series is in itself too slow (for my own taste); a faster pace and at least two hours less could make it a lot better.The oppressing classes appears by the final chapters but is more really a caricature than real people. Too cliched for its own good.The second big problem is the resolution. In may ways contradicts all the previous ideas. Perhaps preparing people for a follow up.In brief; it requires a lot of patience the the depiction of the human condition and the consequences of bad choices make it worth a view (if you and your family can bear the killings).\",\n",

       " \"So Squid Game has taken over the world these last few weeks and I thought that I had to watch it and I have now finished it and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck Koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize.Main Character\\r\\nLee Jung-Jae plays the lead character Gi-Han on the show and he is fantastic. At first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions. As he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support.Supporting Characters\\r\\nThere is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.Story\\r\\nThe story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn't work for me and I think it could have been handled better. Also there are these English speaking VIP's and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.Script\\r\\nThe script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles. For the love of everything holy don't watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching.Style\\r\\nThe show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole. It is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale. The pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and great in there own way.Overall\\r\\nOverall, Squid Game is a truly fantastic show that was so close to getting my 10/10 score. It is a must watch and don't let the language barrier turn you off and get started with it as soon as possible.Rating - 9/10.\",\n",

Absolutely terrible games of chance.This dude shopped this project around for 10 years before Netflix picked it up. Maybe in that time he should have had a few buddies proof read the script and give him some pointers.

This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of \"we play fair games against each other, based on skill\" is throw out the window.

That show didn't end with any conclusion.But Squid Game, trust me, it will have more seasons due to its success, but even if it didn't, it ended nicely, pretty much answering most questions and delivering good conclusions to everything. If anything, I believe more seasons would ruin this, but let's see what happens.In any case, the hype is real, this is a good show you should watch, just don't expect groundbreaking character development or much originality.

       " \"What I liked about itVery addicting for most of the series. Couldn't let go of it.Except for a couple actors, I thought the overall acting was pretty good. MINYU was particularly noticeable - super obnoxious character.Plus points for pulling off a genre that wasn't attempted in K-dramas before.The set and the overall color of the series. Very vibrant color in contrast to the rather grotesque story the series portrayed. Loved that.Decent ending for the games. Was an unexpected ethos of arriving to a rather predictable conclusion.Just the right amount of gore for my taste.----What I didn't like about itVIPs were so cringe. I suppose it's hard to find decent English speaking non Korean actors in Korea. They were truly atrocious.Unclear messaging. Maybe not unclear - just a bit messy job conveying the message.Ep 8-9 were a little dragged on - could have had faster pace.The cop storyline was a little off-putting. Wish we saw more depth and development in there.\",\n",

It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life. I can't say I get the uproar of the series - Netflix's potential biggest- but it's worth a watch if you like dystopian stuff - and who doesn't?\",\n",

       " \"The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I'll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I'm out.\",\n",
       " \"Utterly gripping, engrossing, and devastating, Squid Games hit's a level of tension few other series have. It's not perfect, a little consistent for a single episode, but it is so absorbing at every other moment it seems impossible to mark the series down.Characters are distinct, develop brilliant bonds and each have their own developmental arc. Certain characters show such morality and innocence that investment is put into their stories almost instantly. Backstories are a mixture of tragic and sinister, providing a footing for the audience to base their impressions, but these are twisted and warped so brilliantly throughout that a fully-fleshed out character is always the final product.Acting cannot be faulted, and as a newcomer to Korean TV, all impressions of the actors are fresh. Outbursts of emotion are very explosive, and should be seen and heard in Korean to fully appreciate them.The plot has maybe been played out in various ways in past media, but possibly without such a holistic approach. Down-on-their-luck participants playing life-or-death children's games seems simple, but the execution is perfect due to the building tension. Violence is graphic and intense, but the gore comes in relatively short bursts. The progression of each episode gives the violence such power.One episode in particular is crushing, once a connection has been formed between the audience and each character. The cruelty of each game is paramount, but the reactions within them are devastating.Unfortunately, the most devastating episode is followed by the most disappointing. The introduction of the VIPs is so below the standard of the rest of the characters/series, leaving them out completely and keeping some irritating mystery would have been a lot more satisfying than the lacklustre impact they make. Built on cliches and stuck with terrible dialogue not improved by the acting, it's the one episode that goes against the rest of the series.Having said that, it may have been a necessary evil. It matches with the storyline, but still felt like an addition no one wanted. It cannot detract from the entire series though, everything before is brilliant, everything after saves it again, producing a worthy ending.\",\n",
       " \"A little too much of an advertised series for my taste. I decided to give it a try anyway, there aren't a lot of episodes anyway. Overall, I have to admit that it is a very good series, the best part of it are some of the characters and how various circumstances and the environment affect them. I was mentally prepared for the violence and the blood so it didn't surprise me, I even thought the violence would be even more pronounced. Of these nine episodes, three were below level for me personally, including an ending I didn't like. There are also a few elements in the series that aren't original because we've seen them before, it's not a new concept of how people fight to the death to win a competition. It is somewhat predictable. That's why everything else in the series is at a very high level, the story, the characters, the mystery, I give it two thumbs up.\",\n",

From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable.However.

       " 'Caught a bit by the hype I decided to check this out and boy was I in for a convoluted messy nonsense pile of garbage.I will not go through all the problems with each episode but rather describe the three overarching issues I have with the show.1) the acting - the acting is fine from the 3-4-5 main characters, everyone else however are horrible at it. Someone said that is the point, okay, sure, but if so you direct them different and give them less to do and more to the point scenes so their extremely bad acting do not shine through.2) the production value - this is so low budget that I had a good cry at least half a dozen times each episode. Sets are literary falling apart and you can clearly see the bad construction. You can also hear the lousy music, see the bad clothing, the low quality film work etc. Etc. This is like high-school students having a laugh level of production value.3) Cliche and tiresome nonsense - we have seen all of this many, many times before. All done better, with better acting, better production value, better directing, better story and with a lot better social criticism. This is just a bored Korean mixing some of his favourite movies and tv shows together into nonsens while claiming he is doing the world a favour by exposing capitalism... yawn... Perhaps look a bit north you dirty wet sock of a man you.Put the above together with further critique of each episode and you have some boring nonsense no one should care about. Not sure why people do, but people running around with face masks injecting themselves and bending over for the global elite is surely to like anything you put in front of them. A generous 3/10 and I can not recommend anything about this.',\n",

The viewer doesn't want to see this guy anymore...After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral.

But let\\'s be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they originally are comedians.

       " 'It\\'s been so long since Netflix produced something that\\'s actually good. It\\'s not really surprising that Squid Game arrived from the Eastern cinema, considering the Western Cinema has been dry out of ideas for years at this point. Squid Game is just such a breath of fresh air in 2021, because so far in this year all we got was trash.This show is just so compelling in almost every way. The characters all have differing personalities and ideas and motives, making each character likable in their own different ways. There\\'s no such thing as a \"perfect\" character in Squid Game; everybody is trying to win and they\\'ll give up their own morals to survive. This show focuses on the dark sides of humanity, and it doesn\\'t shy away of what people can do to each other, and that\\'s why this show is so refreshing, because we have realistic people doing realistic things.The overall concept of Squid Game isn\\'t really all that innovative, (a battle royal-ish game being spectated by privileged rich people), but everything around it is innovative. The set design is just fantastic. It\\'s colorful with a bright aesthetic which contrasts well with the dark themes. The directing and acting is also really solid all around, and the pacing is perfect. The only issue being a subplot that ends up leading to nothing.Squid Game is an overall masterpiece of a show. It\\'s extremely thrilling and it\\'ll pull your heartstrings. It\\'s an easy show to get emotionally invested in, and it ends in the most dramatic way possible. This is a show that I\\'d recommend to anyone and I really hope they make a second season, because this is the content that we need in dry times like these.',\n",
       " \"SummarySquid Game is a series with a wonderful production design, a staging that displays a powerful iconography and that admits several readings and records various influences and cinematographic antecedents. Anyway, it is mostly a thriller and a melodrama. Erecting it as a sociopolitical essay is perhaps an excess, although the crude allegory of neoliberal capitalism is clear and its anti-meritocratic message is accurate.REVIEW:456 people with a desperate economic situation agree to risk their lives in a series of games that take place in a concentration environment to win a significant sum of money.I am a person who distrusts the massive successes, so I began to see the series with all the precautions of the case; however, it turned out to be an extremely interesting experience.The gamesThe participants become part of a regime that is concentration-oriented for more than one reason: because of seclusion, military surveillance, because of its violence, cruelty and sadism, and because of its disregard for the human condition and life. The games (based on children's games) are extremely different and generate different and changing dynamics between the participants and a variety of climates between the chapters, although they all display different types of violence. The fewer participants there are, the bigger the prize becomes.The playersThose who play these games constitute a heterogeneous group of desperate people, generally downfalls of the system and highly indebted, the latter situation that alludes to a widespread problem that afflicts South Korea. Their situation pushes them to put their lives at risk, to which they no longer find meaning, and to commit atrocious acts for economic salvation. Little by little the plot will focus on a group of characters, some of whom nevertheless retain traits of humanity in the midst of despair.The systemOne of the first questions that assail the viewer is who is behind the Squid Game, who is organizing it and for what purpose. Unveiling this unknown is essential for the credibility of the story. What's more, it is initially the most intriguing part of the series, as the games and the place where they take place exhibit an extremely sophisticated and expensive organization and infrastructure.Production design and stagingOne of the highlights of the series is its wonderful production design: colorful, creative, elegant and imposing. It exhibits a powerful iconography that allows you to create a world of your own. As in all Korean series, the staging is brilliant, from the intimate melodramatic scenes to the suspense or violence of the games or in combination. Knows how to use the sequence shot and the fixed shot.The gendersThe series can be defined as a thriller profusely watered with gore, crossed, as in any Korean production worth its salt, by the most resounding melodrama when it investigates the stories and motivations of its characters and their interactions during and outside of games. At a certain point, he even ventures into the western.The cinematographic backgroundSquid Game, due to its internal logic, recognizes several cinematographic antecedents; Among others, one can cite Cronenberg's Videodrome and the saga The Hunger Games, only that it takes place in a rigorous present. But there is another little-cited reference: the concentration regime and other elements refer to Pasolioni's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Other aspects are reminiscent of Eyes Wide Shut by Kubrick. Its powerful iconography and staging that create worlds of their own can also be assimilated to those of The Handmaid's Tale.Social, economic and political readingsAlthough I consider that these readings are somewhat overvalued or overanalyzed, it is clear that the dynamics of the games and their participants can be assimilated to that of neoliberal capitalism in its extreme forms (as was Nazism at the time), so much so that it concerns the participants as well as their organizers; it even raises up to a culmination of its predatory logic. A supposed and cynical framework of equal opportunities governs where, however, chance is decisive and despair and the promotion of extreme individualism permanently abort the collective organization. The series also shatters the meritocratic fantasy.The performancesThe performances are very good; They range from naturalism to a certain common buff emphasis on oriental gestures and dramaturgy. They generate empathy and mixed feelings based on the changing behaviors of their characters.The soundtrackSpecial mention for the remarkable soundtrack, which, as in the story, ranges from meditative piano solos to frenetic rhythmic sequences.\",\n",

       " 'Animal World is in my top 10 all-time favorite movies, largely because it was truly an ORIGINAL plot & was so well executed! I love it for it\\'s ORIGINALITY. The further along this series gets, the more I\\'m starting to enjoy it, but also it\\'s becoming an IRREFUTABLE doppelganger of \"Animal World!\" From the debt, the transportation of the contestants, the Mom who\\'s going into the hospital for serious health issues and he can\\'t pay for it, the main character blowing his money on betting & being a child-like burden on his elderly Mom, signing away his Mom\\'s house, the friend who betrayed him (when he knew what the candy-cutting game was) even knowing his friend will likely die and he had multiple opportunities to clue him in, the fact that they\\'re way out on an island (cruise ship) where no one would expect them to be & couldn\\'t find them, even to the organ harvesting! On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they\\'ve hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I\\'m right or wrong. It\\'s a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don\\'t use a movie like a precise blueprint, that\\'s just plagiarism! So, because i love the premise so much, I\\'m hooked and have to see it to the end, even if it irritates me!',\n",
       " 'I feel like I can\\'t really write a critical review because the TV show is that popular. Everyone is raging about it and it will end up making a billion dollars even though they for some reason only sold it for like $20m to Netflix. The first 5 episodes is great cinema. It\\'s a great concept with people playing games with each other for a big money prize at the very end and the losers get killed. The 3 first games are fine enough, but only the first one is great. It does feel like it\\'s always a promise of something bigger and better. Some big reveal that will make the TV show better and deliver on all the hidden factors. But in reality the more they reveal the worse the show gets. It\\'s like revealing the monster in a movie to be some bad CGI creature. Episode 6 already contains a very weak nonsensical game. And the last 2 games are bad. So out of 6 games only 1 was good! That\\'s pretty lame. The twist and turns also all lead to a worse TV show unfortunately. The first 2 episodes promise something big, but instead the show jumps the shark.A gang starts killing other competitors. But why? The more participants are left the higher is your own chance of survival as each participant is testing the games and finding out how to play them better so that everyone\\'s chance of survival increases. So if the gang didn\\'t kill anyone their chance of survival would skyrocket and they could just kill anyone they want before the last game.There is also a side-plot with a cop filming everything. This plot goes nowhere. He is just killed by his brother who runs the game place. But what the cop does makes no sense. For example, as he escapes they see him climb down a ladder. Before they got to him he had already put on a random diving suit and jumped into the water. So we are to believe this happened in maybe 2 minutes? We didn\\'t even know if he could dive or not. It\\'s also not clear why his brother runs the place. He just left his small cheap apartment suddenly and let his fish die to be this extremely powerful figure? The cop later throws his oxygen tanks on a beach while a boat searches for him. So of course they see the oxygen tank from afar and know he is there. These sort of things at the end of the show make no sense. He could have easily hidden on the island and then later found some fishing boat he could wave at.The main problem is of course the big reveal. It\\'s all a violent show for billionaires so they watch people in debt kill each other for a prize. This idea has been explored a thousand times before in many B movies and it doesn\\'t work here either. These Westerners are HORRIBLE actors. It\\'s inexcusable. You can easily get a random person to act better than this. But I assume they were directed by someone who didn\\'t speak English? The episodes they are in are obviously not fun to watch for anyone.And then there are the game rules. They make no sense and are not clearly explained. At times you see some huge twist in a game and a participant saying \"Well, you said the rules were such and such so that\\'s how I won the game\". So after the fact we get some info about how this guy broke a game. This is a thing in all 6 games. The rules are vague and winners and losers just come about by some mystery. It\\'s not terrible, just a bit weak as it makes little sense. In game 5 on the glass panels you even see the game maker shut off the light to make the game harder as they were near the very end. The game maker needed the last game to only have 2 survivors as only 1 winner is allowed. So while everyone thinks there is no limit and groups plan to win together in reality only one person can win yet no one knows this besides the game maker himself. This is also why the moderators let people kill each other and change the games as they are ongoing to kill a few more people. Also, the gang gets info about what game they are to play beforehand. Kinda a huge deal. These sort of changes and twists make it harder to really feel like these are real games. Rather it\\'s just methods to kill people. The rules are never fair. At one point a game maker even takes part in a game and makes his own team win. Honestly, the reveals are horrible. The brother reveal makes no sense as we don\\'t even know how the cop or brother is. And the old guy who also plays the games is a bad reveal too because it\\'s just a random twist. It\\'s not some info we were looking for.The ending makes no sense either. The winner doesn\\'t spend any money even though he promised to help some specific people. Family members of friends killed in the game. And at the end he just walks somewhere. We never really understand what his plans are. If he or 500 other people wanted to they could have revealed the game. We even see him talk to cops. And many others surely also talked to cops. Even in the VIP areas were see a bunch of waiters and naked ladies just laying around. So all these random naked ladies know about all these murders too. Of course all the workers know about this too. If you want to have an ending with the winner trying to reveal the whole thing that makes absolutely no sense because he could have tracked this whole operation down in a week. They leave clues everywhere. If you put this info online people would find the location in a day. They would just search for underground buildings with huge automatic roofs that can open. Such projects would have thousands of workers and can be seen from space. This part of the TV show makes zero sense so having the lead decide to finally do something about it after a year makes no sense whatsoever. He could have revealed it all in a day. Anyone could. This and then the 2 big twist reveals are terrible. It\\'s not really anything huge so you may just ignore it. But it illustrates how bad the writing actually is. It shows why the games are stupid and lazy too. It\\'s not smart stuff.',\n",

       " \"Korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on Netflix called Squid Game.Taking inspiration from the simple childhood games played in Korea, a shadowy organization embarks on recruiting out-of-luck people who are burdened by large debts. They then proceed to make these 'contestants' participate in life-or-death versions of these simple games with a large pot of cash as a reward on offer for the final victor.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the genius director behind Silenced (2011) and The Fortress (2017), weaves a rich tapestry of intricate characters ranging from a Machiavellian investment banker to a lazy absentee dad to a North Korean refugee turned pick-pocket.Despite the immense production value and sets, it is these finely written characters that capture your imagination and sucker you into binging the 9-episode thrill ride at a stretch.Lee Jung-jae is electric as the gambling addict who has to embark on the game to cure his mom's illness while O Yeong-su captivates with his nuanced portrayal of an elderly man with seemingly nothing to lose, slowly dying with an ever-growing tumor in his head.Park Hae-soo plays all the layers of his troubled investment banker role with gusto, portraying all the ethical dilemmas and moral turpitude his character faces with conviction. Jung Ho-yeon buys you into the North Korean defector role and the lengths to which she will go to secure the money to enable the rest of her family to cross over to the South.With the storyline pointing clearly towards a Season 2, the director has left enough plot points incomplete to keep the audiences eager for the next instalment of this landmark series.Netflix seemingly has another worldwide sensation on its hands just as Money Heist seems to be drawing to a close.Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!\",\n",
       " \"Pros:\\r\\n1. There is great use of the colour palette, with greys, blacks, whites, browns and navy blues in the outside world used to portray a miserable, lifeless and oppressive world, whereas bright colours are used for Squid Game to ironically convey a place of death where they felt more alive and unburdened than they did in the outside world.2. The gore is brutal and gut-wrenching, but it's never over-the-top which helps the gore feel more real.3. The fight/ action scenes are raw and gritty, with the usage of close-up shots to heighten the claustrophobia and personal touch, thereby heightening the tension.4. The score does an incredible job at building up the atmosphere, in addition to being instantly recognisable.5. The deaths of Ali (Anupam Tripathi) Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) and Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) are deftly handled and are real tear-jerkers.6. The practical effects and set design are beautifully designed and they do an amazing job at building the Squid Game world.7. The show provides a really good psychological study on how humans react when their lives and fortunes are on the line, i.e. Self-preservation or cooperation; decisive or indecisive.8. Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is on the receiving end of a satisfying character ark from irresponsible, lazy and indecisive, to the complete opposite.9. There are phenomenal performances by Lee Jung-jae and Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo).Cons:\\r\\n1. The flashbacks inserted to reiterate information the show has already told the audience, are redundant and patronising.2. It's baffling, and largely unbelievable, that the Squid Game operation has been going since 1999, yet only one cop in the recent year found multiple disappearances strange enough to investigate - and he was only investigating because of his brother.3. It was far too easy for Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-Joon) to infiltrate the secret island. You'd think that type of operation wouldn't make it as easy as they did to sneak onto the island.4. A lot of the information divulged during the show is done so via lazy exposition, the show doesn't seem to deem the audience intelligent enough to work things out for themselves.5. The criticism of the modern Neo-liberal, hyper-individualistic, capitalist system is rather on-the-nose, and it feels preachy and pretentious most of the time. There's a bizarre sub-theme of anti-Americanism and white supremacy that just feels forced.6. There is a ridiculous amount of screen-time wasted on a bizarre organ-harvesting sub-plot that doesn't go anywhere, and is clearly just placed so that the show can air the supposed virtue of equality and fairness, whilst Front man (Lee Byung-hun) who airs it, sanctions the killings of people who for whatever reason, found themselves in debt.\",\n",

The show basically ask will you be true to yourself? Do you have a price? The main guy, although a gambler, stayed true to himself as a nice person(deep down), believes in the goodness of humanity. Goodness of other people. (Just look at his smiley photo snapshot). Even though he won, he was much troubled by the lives lost, disgusted by the money, and dumbfounded by the \"reasoning\" behind it all.001, the number one man(1% of the world?) is basically echoing the sentiment of \"rosebud\" from Citizen Kane and laments the place where adults can never return to...childhood. But do you think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson would have watched this show? (Maybe Elon Musk). Na, they have a space race to run.There are many threads to follow up on if there\\'s a 2nd season. The origin of this game. The cop that jumped off the cliff. The recruiter in the subway. And obviously will the main character go back to another game? And if so what will he do?I get there are bad acting segment with the VIP. But the they do serve the representation of crass upper class. Overall the length of the series is just right. Detail oriented, simple games, thoughtful interactions (the marble episode comes to mind), tense (first game, voting, tug of war, formation of groups ) and full of all the character arch (good, bad and ugly) of humanity. Great cinematography, color palette, bgm score, sets, character development, production and plot.The final game on the island is not a game but a duel of values. And ask again, will you be true to yourself? Same with the last bet on his death bed from the old man. But the irony is that he lost not only the bet but also his life. Double irony that he didn\\'t get to see the results.Do you believe in the goodness of people?',\n",

The purity of children\\'s games and the life-to-life struggle between adults form a contrast, which is even more ironic. The character settings, personalities, and relationship portrayals are not bad. But the reversal of the ending is really a forced reversal, anticlimactic.',\n",
       " 'I tend to argue that when South Korean creators are at their peak, they\\'re giving 150%. This intensity and occasional brutality (the works hold back neither in terms of the raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like Secret Sunshine and Oldboy, while close to flawless, don\\'t necessarily find pop-culture success the world over.But we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to South Korean media than bouncy BTS videos, more so than when Parasite arrived and gave the Korean Wave a considerable push. For all their problems, we can thank Netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform.I was incredibly excited to watch Squid Game, even though I at first deemed it \"suspiciously popular\". What was it? One of those rare pieces of media that\\'s clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be \"hip\", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven\\'t seen this type of art yet? (Or maybe those who only watched it because Korean media is the current \"cool\" thing to consume and didn\\'t grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don\\'t make sense about the setting, which, as per the show\\'s themes and social satire, aren\\'t supposed to make sense).Ultimately, Squid Game (original title Ojing-eo Geim) proved to mostly be the former. That is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don\\'t understand it and enjoy it \"in spite of some plot holes\").At a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of The Hunger Games and Saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it\\'s also a better social metaphor than The Platform). A varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a Kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children\\'s games for a reward of 45 billion won. However, should they lose, the penalty is instant death.This becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave. It\\'s around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking. I won\\'t reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn\\'t end at episode 2 of 9. Subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare.The characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable. We go from loathing the down-on-his-luck Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden \"Player 1\" (O Yeung-su) harbors strategic insight. There are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone.There is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character. I was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize I might not be joking. Squid Game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons.Some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious. That being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the Gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of TV/streaming I\\'ve seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft). It\\'s not as unpredictable as Game of Thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it\\'s hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest. This isn\\'t the same as Plot Armor.My only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a Hunger Games sequel, complete with cartoonish Rich People™ from across the world, including ones who speak American English (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not English). And yes, I will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show\\'s poetry and dramatic timing.Still, Squid Game is quite the piece of work and I could praise it for far longer than I already have. Its success sets a good precedent. Like Parasite (another far-reaching showcase of South Korean vigor), Squid Game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won\\'t be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it\\'s \"cool\" or not. Still, it\\'s hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show\\'s message.I\\'m told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on TikTok, and for what it\\'s worth, the mainstream reaction could\\'ve been much worse. (My generation isn\\'t much smarter than Zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in Project X.) We might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what I\\'m truly spaeing is for Elon Musk or whatever to take a look at this and go \"Squid Game, huh? That sounds pretty neat!\"',\n",
       " \"A masterful series for its great script and interpretation of its actors. Lee Jung-jae has done a wonderful performance, but the best thing about this series is seeing human behavior and despair of not having money to live.

       " \"This show was phenomenal. I didn't start watching it for a few weeks after it came out because it didn't seem super interesting. It didn't appeal to me. But then it stayed at #1 on Netflix for over a month, everyone was talking about, and it seemed like the only thing on social media at the time, so I decided to check it out. I speak English, but I wanted to have the true show experience, so I watched it in Korean. I wanted to hear the actors real voices, and it bothers me when the voice doesn't match up with the movement on the screen. Regardless, the Korean actors were great. I don't know how to judge actors when they are speaking Korean, but it seemed really well done. I was skeptical about watching the VIP episode because of what people said about their acting. To be honest, I couldn't figure out what was so bad about it. Sure it wasn't amazing, and they were weird at times, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people said it was. I've talked about the acting, now I will talk about the show. Hwang Dong-hyuk is a genius. The plot of this show was so unique and so cool to watch. Every game that played was very entertaining to watch, it is hard for me to pick a favorite. I also liked how the show wasn't just these people playing kids games, it actually explored some of the characters lives. I just thought it was cool. Lastly, I loved the characters. All of them were great, but my favorites had to be Gi-hun, Ali, and the Old Man. Their characters were just so likable. Those were just my favorites, there were so many more I liked.If you haven't already, I definitely recommend watching this to anyone, you won't regret it. My recommendation is to watch the snow in Korean, but if you are just looking to relax and not read the subtitles whenever someone talks, watch it in your main language. I really hope there is a season 2, it will be cool to see what they do after the ending.\",\n",
       " \"I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren't that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)\",\n",
       " \"Terrific show; a timely watch. While it certainly dabbles in issues regarding social status, I more so saw this show's narrative as a debate on society's morality and compassion. Mixing offbeat scenarios with unyielding brutality, Squid Game shows how desperate, callous and even savage humans can be when the conditions are met and that capitalism serves more as a byproduct of these behaviors. It asks the question: Does humanity still possess any decency in such an oppressed and unforgiving world? Highly recommend it. It's a breath of fresh air for anyone craving something unique. A gripping survival drama full of palpable suspense and sharp commentary.\",\n",
       " \"I'm usually not one to instantly check a show out when it's trending, but after seeing so many TikTok videos of people trying to cut perfect shapes out of the famous Dalgona snack cookies with small needles, and seeing how the stakes couldn't get much higher what with those who failed at said task would get killed (which was very jarring), I caved in and decided to see what I was missing. And after episode 9 ended, I want more. Because not only did the hype behind this show click, but it also may be even better than I thought it would already be. And me wanting more isn't me saying that the season was too short or anything, but considering how near flawlessly everything worked here, I've never been this interested in a show like this in a long time. One of the reasons for this are the characters. They're all so damn good and well written. Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Ali, Il-Nam, Sae-byeok, Jun-ho, and pretty much everyone else are all effective and very likable, even those who took villainous paths (being vague to avoid spoilers). This is emphasized by the performances, as they are absolutely phenomenal, as everyone here kills it. I felt the fear, anger, happiness, sadness, and tiredness from everyone here, making this have some of the best casting I've seen in a show yet. The story, as well, is superb. To keep it somewhat brief, it's essentially how people who are in massive amounts of debt are taken to a secret island where they must play childhood-like games to win-except, if you lose one of them, you don't just lose the game. You lose your life. At first, that may seem somewhat simple. But the way this show handles it with its excellent pacing, characterization, and world building (all with lots of gore), it works very, very well. It's not only tense, but it's very emotional. And that goes for all 9 episodes here. I was constantly at the edge of my seat. This show is also an excellent parody of capitalism, as it loosely portrays how the top 1% looks down on everyone else, and that even though money is the driving factor for everyone else, it's not necessarily money that makes life better-because the top 1% rot their brains of greed and are actually worse. So much so, that the lives of fellow people who are poor don't matter as much. And I think this show nailed that wonderfully. Overall, the first season is masterfully written, directed, performed, and executed, and I'm very excited to see what the inevitable season 2 brings to the table, because so far, this is one of the best shows I've seen in the past decade, and I hope Hwang Dong-hyuk keeps up the pace, because he did one hell of a job, here.\",\n",

       " 'As survival series go, \"Squid Game\" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a \"Hunger Games\", \"Saw\", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards. The show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator.The stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind. The parts where they delved into the Human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom... This part, more than anything else, made this Korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted.The show came close to relying on clichéd tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow Dong-hyuk Hwang evaded all those loopholes and \\'convenience zones\\'. He also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire.Every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point. Neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline. The thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work.Jaeil Jung\\'s musical scoring more than \\'made it work\\' where this series was concerned. He captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes. That ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often... That never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense.Great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes. These, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on IMDB), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric.A few negatives... There were no cameras in the restrooms. This particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there. No cavity checks of the prisoners - that was another \\'tricky\\' omission. The highly trained guards were otherwise not immediately suspicious when one of their own started to act out of protocol. However, these and a handful of other \\'loopholes\\' were needed to progress the plot and did not feel contrived - emphasis on that word, that\\'s where the magic lay in this series.I highly recommend watching all nine episodes in their original Korean-language (non-dubbed) version. Feel free to rely on subtitles to stay informed. That\\'s how I watched \"Squid Game\" on Netflix. The \\'feel\\' was so much different than when I \\'tested\\' a few minutes of the show in its English dub.Being in debt is no joke, it truly destroys lives and families, even entire friendships and romances. This series captured the sheer helplessness of being in debt, and it did so through its characters. It also captured the depths of human depravity, and what some people with too much money are willing to do.With Netflix\\'s \"Squid Game\" Dong-hyuk Hwang has made a \\'dark\\' mark one won\\'t soon forget. He proved how artfully you can take a cliché, or something familiar, and twist it into something new. \"Squid Game\" had that in abundance, and made me feel like I was watching something genuinely artistic and soulful. The show went deep into the primal nature of Humankind instead of just showcasing our \\'better nature\\'.',\n",
       " \"There's a lot of hype surrounding this series. I thought it was okay, I almost didn't finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1. The problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable.After fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, I stuck with the show.So the show is visually interesting. I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)\\r\\nThere were quite a few irritating characters. Very stereotypical gangster type. You'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. But I'll get back to that later.Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. You also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades. Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. Then it just loses steam and gets dumb. The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story. It's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show.The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on.The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming. And it doesn't even play out all that well.After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored. What's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn't know who he was.They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk. I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs.See, so many questions, so many holes. The final ending is also pretty bad. Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending.\",\n",

Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.\",\n",

It's not an original story but a twist on an old classic. What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing. You can't google translate this stuff. It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it's a huge speed bump in the entertainment value. All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves. Well, the ones on screen. The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators.But, what's glaringly obvious is the racial aspect. That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani. But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean. In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western. A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too. So the slurs are intentional. Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement.\",\n",
       " \"And I'm hard to please!Being a massive fan of Korean cinema and horror I couldn't help sitting through the first three episodes happily identifying all the obvious influences which were by no means restricted to Korean cinema and horror.So the obvious comparisons with films like Old Boy and the Sympathy with Lady vengeance are there. The deshevilled under class of loan dependent opportunists of Parasite.But then there was the island of the Japanese classic, Battle Royale or the cult British 60's TV series, The Prisoner. Additionally there were the not too subtle pieces of political and social commentary which echoed recent Spanish films, Platform and Cadaver.However, it's no accident that the entire plot of Squid Game revolves around the visually striking staircase that for us art school students of the 90s instantly recognised as the post-modern Memphis style. For me this was a kind nod to the 80s post modernist architectural tradition of borrowing other people's ideas and incorporating it into something new and visually striking.And that's the point at which I stopped caring that Squid Game was in essence a neo-postmodern composite and started enjoying the ride.And what a ride.No spoilers here but suffice to say every episode had me experience the full range of emotions, from dread and anger, sympathy and blood list for revenge, Squid Game is brilliantly crafted.The horror genre nerds might try to dismiss some part of the plot as being derivative, but every one needs to remember that Korean cinema doesn't care about genre.Seriously, take a day off work, order take away food and strap yourself in and watch the whole thing in one day. You won't regret it.\",\n",

But no, we get stealing from his mom, failure at the track, encounter with bookies...After that we\\'re introduced a pointless \"game\". Who runs that and to what end? The contestants are unknown so wagering makes no sense. Randomly killing losers makes no sense. Some kind of government thing makes no sense. Gladiator stories like Hunger Games or the Maze series work because the heroes are chosen for their skills. These people were chosen for their lack of skill. Huh?The acting is amateur at best. There isn\\'t one likable character. The ending was shoehorned in to allow for an unexpected season 2.This is so far from watchable for me on so many levels I can only assume I\\'m not the intended audience.

There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch. \"Squid Game\" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like \"Pulp Fiction,\" and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time. With \"Squid Game,\" you will not be wasting time. I guarantee it.',\n",

       " 'Squid Game is a South Korean series on Netflix that blew up recently and got on my radar. Didn\\'t watch any trailers or read any reviews, all I knew was that it was about some \"Game\" and thought it might be like those Japanese game shows or maybe kinda like Wipeout but with a story. That didn\\'t exactly turn out to be the case and I was hooked quickly during the first episode. The series is about a bunch of people knee-deep in troubles joining a game where they compete for a massive cash prize where the penalty for failure is extreme.Boasting multiple characters that you get to know over the course of the season, all backed up by wonderful performances from the cast, getting invested in the story comes easy. They are a varied bunch and the way the series is directed and paced, you pretty much feel as if you\\'re going through this ordeal alongside them. The psychological manipulation that the organization has set up for them and trying to see what you would have done in the situation only adds to the entertainment.I loved how the creator of the series took mostly common games that a lot of us probably have played sometimes in our childhoods and turned them macabre. With good direction and well-paced flow, the tension was often racked up to a great degree and the more you get attached to certain characters, the more intense it got, sometimes being outright brutal and gut-wrenching (I\\'m looking at you Episode 6). The games never got boring nor did they get repetitive as there would mostly be some twists and turns added into the mix.It also doesn\\'t hurt the experience that this feels like a big production and not what you\\'d expect from a \"Game\" series. Apart from a few shoddy CGI shots which can easily be dismissed, most of it looked and sounded great.However, the series does falter a bit in the second half where, for spoilers sake, let\\'s just say some things get revealed and they are what you\\'d boringly expect and probably have predicted early on. On top of that, the performances in that chunk, especially relative to the performances from the rest of the cast, just weren\\'t good. Would have wished they kept things in the dark more, keep the air of mystery or have a bit more meat. Good thing it doesn\\'t ruin the series nor does it impact the overall story a great deal which does end on a high note with social commentary and messaging that one can enjoy.Overall, props to Hwang Dong-hyuk, the Writer and Director, who after a long journey of being rejected by so many areas finally got to make his series and it\\'s heartwarming to see it get so popular and receive praise and his hard work pay off immensely, so Never Give Up I guess. Unless you\\'re squeamish and can\\'t handle rough stuff, I\\'d highly recommend this series to everyone, but chances are you have already seen it. Had a great time with it. Wherever they decide to take the story next, I\\'ll certainly am looking forward to it. And if I were to rate it, I\\'d give it an 8.5/10.',\n",

The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still.

The poor were just things for him to play with, for some fun and excitement. Anyway, the range of emotions I felt while watching the episodes was enough to leave me somewhat exhausted, but in a good way. Really, I gotta hand it to the team that worked on this because it was clearly a high budget and high quality production.

       " 'While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don\\'t expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga \"Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji\", which has been running from 1996. It\\'s been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing \"Squid Game\".The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this \"inspiration\".There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. \"Squid Game\" definitely satisfies in this department, although it\\'s not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong\\'s \"Burning\" (2018) or the Oscar-winning \"Parasite\". But the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if Bong Joon-ho would do a superhero movie called \"The Vengeancers\".',\n",
       " \"The Good:I don't give 10s out lightly. Squid Game deserves this score because there is NOTHING else that came out in 2021 that became a cultural phenomenon like this one. No astroturfing, no manufactured hype. A genuine global phenomenon that emerged organically. How about that?Squid Game is television at its absolutely finest. I can't tell you the last time I was immediately transfixed by a show and captivated from beginning to end. Where do I even start with this?The incredible characters, who are more human and realistic than 99% of the people we ever see on screen? The incredible layered writing that gives each person such depth and complexity? The performances, which are so powerful and excellent, that the cast became overnight global celebrities? The pacing of the show which - save for episode 8 - is basically perfect? The twists and turns, shocking reveals and incredible easter eggs layered throughout? The tension generated from a brutal, misanthropic world that nevertheless has a twisted sense of morality and fairness? The iconic visuals? The set and costume design that keeps these images in your head long after you've seen the show?The exciting, diverse and incredible set pieces? How an episode about marbles - literally the least visually compelling game in the series - is universally declared one of the best episodes of television ever produced? Or how the first game grabs you and immediately sums up the ethos of the entire show?What about the heavy themes, which delve deep into explorations of human nature, greed, solidarity; that reflect contemporary anxieties about income inequality in South Korea (and increasingly, the world)? Hell, this and Parasite have solidified South Korea as a cultural superpower and honestly, if I were Korean, I would be extremely proud. The Korean Wave is going to be a tsunami.I can go on and on about what this show does well: how you can spend hours dissecting it, how it balances extremely dark and sadistic subject matter with humanity, tenderness and humour, how it subverts expectations the RIGHT WAY. It's a 10.The Bad: Perfection doesn't truly exist. And if I wanted to really pick out a flaw, it's Episodes 7 and 8. I'll touch on the VIPs after, but all-in-all, Episode 7 is still a great episode. It just adds some elements (like narration), that I didn't see as necessary. Episode 8 is an emotional wrecking ball, but it's weirdly short and kind of out of place.The Ugly: Okay, so the major criticism I've been seeing has been the performances and dialog of the VIPs. Notwithstanding the difficulty of finding fluent, non-Korean English speakers in South Korea, directing them (whilst not speaking the same language) and writing English dialog as a non-English speaker, the VIPs are highly intentional.Squid Game does not portray the wealthy upper class as an elite group of hyper sophisticated, intelligent people. This is probably a more realistic depiction: they're crude, callous, cringe inducing and save for their wealth, pathetic people. The casting of Gong Yoo and Lee Byung-Hun - who are basically Brad Pitt/Leo DiCaprio levels of famous in South Korea - was meant to imply that the wealthy retain these handsome, sophisticated men to project an elite status. But it doesn't exist. In reality, these are just douchebags.That the mind behind all of this is, well, the last person you'd expect, but in reality, would be the MOST LIKELY to do something like this, drives this point home even more.In summation. Either you've watched Squid Game or not at this point. It's a masterpiece. It's the best content I've seen all year. Just watch it and make up your own mind.\",\n",

I did not really understand the whole organ harvesting side plot, and it seemed unnecessary.

The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?\",\n",

Such operation could not become unnoticed.I've noticed the cop's phone was about 60% charged at the beginning, so hiw did ge kept his battery until the end?The old man's identity was known to middle staff (soldiers), which didn't made much sense.In any case it's a good one and worth to check out.\",\n",

It is highly stylised and quite a few of the scenes come across as they've been taken straight out the pages of a graphic novel...all this means is that it looks great!Situations bring out the worst in people mostly, but also sometimes the best in people, as characters choose to work together or betray each other to make it to the end.

The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face.

I'm an ardent fan of Korean movies because of the way of representation and the choosing of subjects they are portraying. Squid Game is the first Korean series I am watching that also provides that kind of Korean fragrance. It's about games not only one game but also the children's game popular among in Korea. The basic core of the movie is the need for money and the problems and struggles followed by the low-class section of the Korean community. The series gets more engaged when the contestants participate in the game. And the game is something like a survival one because those who failed in the game will be killed. It is a do-or-die action for them. Initially, there were 456 contestants and when the game progresses the number gets decreased and the amount in the piggy bank becomes increases. When the last man survives he gets an amount of 45.6 billion won as a reward. This might be the capsule plot behind Squid Game. There might arise a lot of questions regarding this capsule plot. Who conducts these survival games? What did they get while conducting these games? Is it legal or illegal? Like this, you'll have many more doubts and questions regarding Squid Game.

       " 'This will be your thorough start-to-end review. I am going to mention that this series got right, and everything it got wrong. I am rating it a 5 overall. It\\'s a solid 8 for the first 5 episodes, and just ONE star for the remaining episodes. You\\'ll understand why.And in advance, excuse me for my not-so-good English. (Im not native).Overview:\\r\\nThis series was a risk to take, the director knows that very well. It\\'s very bloody, and the centerpiece of the plot deals with a rather sensitive idea. It was no problem because it was handled as it should be, not perfectly but, it was good and enjoyable, until it started falling apart and the bad outweighed the good.The Good:\\r\\nThe idea is great. If you have watched this series, you must have a faint idea about why this had so much buzz in such a short time. The whole concept of \"Hunger Games\" style, being played by the wealthy but not forced to do so, as well as the kids\\' game as their theme, did pretty well in the first episodes. It was fair, square, and it lived up to its own concept.There were stereotypical characters, and others really well-written, the entire cast is great, memorable, and there are characters who you would root for. All characters had a common thing between them, financial misery, and that money can solve all problems, yet they had some depth to them. It\\'s not the best character writing but it sure did the job.The atmosphere was so great during the first 5 episodes, you can actually LIVE in the shoes of the characters, you can see what they see, you can feel it, you start actually relating to them. It\\'s all great, it\\'s what the series is meant to do.The acting for most characters was great, the dialogue is smart (I watched it in fan-subs, as the original subs didn\\'t do it for me).The Bad:\\r\\nThe main character is kind of \"stale\" to me, it\\'s not really someone I\\'d care about, he is a loser, and he is set out to be one all the series but he ends up winning just like that, he gets this psychological breakdown after he wins, but it just feels so not right. The main character is just wrong. I am pretty sure everyone shares the same opinion. It\\'s not about the actor, but the director didn\\'t really get so clever about managing his MC\\'s façade it felt flat.It becomes predictable towards EP 6: You start wishing something unpredictable happens. Most characters just die during the 4th and 5th game, and there\\'s not much to see after that.It deviates from its concept: Kids game, right? That\\'s what made the first 4 games great, as soon as they deviated from that logic, it started feeling like a different series, ones we didn\\'t sign up for, nor did we want.The Ugly:\\r\\nRemember the policeman who played spy to look for his brother? Such a really long side-plot for what? We watched him infiltrate the island but for what? He gets shot off by his own brother, nothing happens afterwards. We sure haven\\'t seen him die but something about the entire side plot should\\'ve happened during the first season because it took a lot of screentime of the FIRST season. Simply leaving it for a second season after it took so much time from the first season is just ridiculous and kind of greedy. Also, being shot by his own brother is really cliché.VIPs: This is a grand \"kek\", they were just very bad and a pain to watch. Nothing about them really adds anything to the series, they had so much potential, and the air of mystery about them faded away poorly as soon as they started talking nonsense. I get the director wanted us to hate them, but this bittered the drinkNothing gets resolved: This is the big downside of the entire series: So WHAT. They want to enforce the fact the money doesn\\'t buy happiness, it does buy happiness. But that\\'s not the point, because the contestants CHOSE to partake in the blood fest. Yet somehow the MC kept whining and whining seeing people die. What the hell? You signed up for it, you get what you wished for, lolz.Last game is a buzzkill: They should\\'ve come up with a better 1 on 1 game. It was already a big let-down when they killed off the girl like that, but seriously? Suicide? After all he went through ? So freaking stupid.The last 3 episodes just killed a lot of braincells in my head. It felt like the director and the writers just turned the switch of thinking in their brain OFF. I couldn\\'t help but feel so bad for not just skipping to the end of the last episode.All in all, it was fun to start with, and kind of an ultimate disappointment in the end. But it\\'s still good, totally worth your time but no way in hell does it come close to the best 100 series ever.',\n",
       " 'This one isn\\'t popular because it\\'s groundbreaking or going where television hasn\\'t been before, but because of the story it\\'s telling. Korean television/cinema has had a big boom among Western audiences in the last few years and I\\'m glad to see it because they do create wonderful media and are excellent storytellers. Squid Game, however, isn\\'t any different from what the Japanese offered us through Battle Royale some decades prior but given the current socio/political climate we\\'re living in, this show was released at just the right time.Ultimately, it\\'s a critique on capitalism and how it dehumanizes people. We see how far a person will go just to have a fat wallet. I think the show does a good job at tackling this topic by showing the negative effects this greed has on people. We see how some working class people get lost in their pursuit of insane wealth to the point of financial ruin and how some of the wealthy elite have so much money than they know what to do with so they decide to bet on working class people like one would do on horses - a comparison that is made in the show.The characters we follow who join the games are all in financial ruin and desperately need money to pay off their debts. The first episode gives us the backstory of the main protagonist, Gi-Hun and the second one gives us glimpses into the lives of the other main characters whom the show will focus on as the games progress. The initial antagonist character among them, the gangster guy, is your stereotypical bad guy. Bullying everyone in the facility, cheating, beating a guy to death - he meets all the \"bad guy is bad\" stereotypes. Our protagonist isn\\'t perfect but he has a good heart and seems to be one of only a few who has a decent moral compass. The latter being debatable with the choice he makes at the end, but we\\'ll get there in a moment.The way each episode is written, you know that Gi-Hun is going to end up winning the game no matter what. Although this irritated me a bit because of how predictable it was, they do manage to hit with shocks and surprises despite the obvious outcome. Since there are various main characters we were following, you begin to root for several of them, most notably Sae-Byeok, Ali, and Player 001. So when these characters lose the game, it does have an emotional impact to those who get invested in the story which seems to be everyone, really. In that respect, the show succeeds at making people feel something and at times left in shock despite how predictable. An interesting balance to strike but Squid Game does it. I don\\'t think anything sets the viewer up for the big plot twist at the end, sadly I was expecting it because it got spoiled for me - it\\'s hard not to have this show spoiled with how popular it is on social media. However, it is quite a big twist that actually really brings the critique at the center of this story home.Now my issues with this show have to do with it\\'s B plot and the awful VIP\\'s that were introduced near the end of the games. The B plot is that of a detective that sneaks his way onto the boat when the players decide to return and continue playing the game. He makes it pretty far in his mission to investigate and expose these sadistic games but the climax for this plot is very underwhelming. I guess the game master or head henchman turns out to be the detective\\'s brother and this revelation is what makes the detective give up, so he lets himself be shot and killed. Maybe they were trying to accomplish something with this plot, this one did manage to keep me in suspense and the ending upset me - while the predictable main plot kept me in some suspense but really got me with its ending. I suppose I\\'ll be further unpacking that one. It might not be that deep though and just be speedy storytelling when it comes to the B plot.Now for the complaint that seems to be everyone else\\'s, the awful VIP\\'s. I wouldn\\'t have an issue with the appearance of these characters if it wasn\\'t for the horrid way they were acted out. The voices were too irritating to hear, every time they came out and spoke, I felt like the minutes dragged on. The dialogue for them was awful too. Now it\\'s possible it was written by someone who\\'s first language isn\\'t English, but the actors (who I assume are native English speakers) couldn\\'t pitch in and amend that ? Well what can you expect from them when the acting was atrocious. I read online that the actors were asked to perform this way but intentional as it may be, it was irritating and really dragged down the show in my opinion. They were a cheesy addition to the show. I get they\\'re necessary to the plot, but had they been performed differently, in a less \"1960\\'s cartoon villain\" way then they would\\'ve been on par with the rest of the show. I think speaking in normal voices and saying sentences that normal people say, would\\'ve made it much more sadistic. I mean that\\'s the theme throughout the show.All in all, I enjoyed the series. I wasn\\'t fond with the ending showing the character deciding to go back and expose the game, instead of going to see his kid - and he\\'s the hero we were supposed to root for ? Guess that\\'s to set us up for season 2, but I think this show works better if there\\'s new characters each season and if they must bring back the main character, he could come back after taking care of important things. Still, I will definitely be watching season 2 when it\\'s available. Believe it or not I\\'m actually happy this is as popular as it is, it means people are becoming more aware of the reality we\\'re living in.',\n",

       " 'Squid Game is a South Korean survival drama. I started watching the series after seeing the trailer thinking of it as a cool fun adventure thriller, instead, it turned out to be more of a hard-hitting human story. It has so much depth for a survival series genre which is mainly known for brutality and gore, which it has in plenty, but also adds to it with the writing having heart-wrangling social commentary.The writing and direction are class, the casting spot on, the music, set pieces as well as camera angle really add to the thrill. The only complaint I have is, it was two episodes too long, dragged in the middle.',\n",

       " 'After finishing the show today (I braced myself not to watch it all in one sitting) and without reading spoilers (but recognising many of the hints), I think this show is liked and disliked for the wrong reasons by many.I don\\'t know what Koreans think of the show, but have quite a few Asian friends who liked it. It\\'s always been a bit funny to me, because most Asians I know NEVER seem interested in their continents movies or shows and prefer Hollywood.Personally, I think Hollywood is about as bad as it can be (at least I hope it can\\'t get even worse) and there\\'s almost nothing for me.Since the late 90s, Japan and Korea (also Brazil and Mexico) have done quite a few amazing movies.Korea with Brotherhood, OldBoy, the brilliant Shiri/Swiri, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and the very twisty \"The Wailing\" (Squid Game reminded me of that, although they are about different topics),\\r\\nJapan with gems like Swallowtail Butterfly, Love Exposure, Confessions, to name only a few.Many of the mediocre or bad reviews complain about things that show that they never watched Asian movies and can\\'t seem to get into the culture.One example is the character of Min-Yeo.Sure, on the surface, she\\'s a manipulative lady, seemingly just cruel and selfish. But I was rather shocked to see how many people consider her to be just as bad as the gangster.The actress gave an interview and said she actually felt very bad for her character and that her character, though nasty and feisty is actually just very afraid and alone. We can see that in her own way, how she wants to \"belong\". Think how she learned to use her body or anything to \"entice\" men. Such behavior is usually learned from a traumatic childhood. I really would have loved to know her backstory and hope we will get to know more about her in season 2.I actually didn\\'t hate ANY of the characters. Many said they couldn\\'t sympathize or like any of the characters, but I didn\\'t feel that way. Good or bad, they all had their two sides. The only exceptions are probably Daek-Su and the VIPs, but they are that way for a reason. Heck, there were times in the beginning when I even felt a little bad for Daek-Su.I think Squid Game is trying to show us that we are all neither good or bad people by nature. It\\'s our actions that make us either good or bad.Comparisons to movies like the Hunger Games (yuk!) or Battle Royale don\\'t seem very fitting. One reviewer mentions Oldboy, but I don\\'t see that either. Oldboy and the trilogy around it is about revenge. Squid Game is NOT about revenge. It\\'s more about human nature and how chasing after money is not fulfilling and that money does NOT bring us happiness.Don\\'t you think most of these characters would gladly forfeit all that money if they could bring back the people they lost? Our hero sure doesn\\'t seem happy about his winnings.And Battle Royale... it\\'s similar in a sense that it pits everyone vs everyone, but it\\'s all about punishment. Squid Game isn\\'t about punishment either. Nobody is forced to participate. Heck, even before they cross the glass bridge or any other game, the players ALWAYS have the option to call it quits. It\\'s their greed or desperation that keeps them going. And in some cases, their lack of perspective.Although the big twists are not really a surprise if you watch out for some hints that give them away, I think this has been a very good show. I think the reason it\\'s been so successful is that although it is almost \"normal\" for Korean or Asian movies to \"not end happy\", Western audiences aren\\'t used to it. Surely had this been an American show, the hero wouldn\\'t have learned anything and just spent the money and have a sugary happy ending.The fact that it doesn\\'t end in such a \"perfect\" (and thus unnatural) way is why I like Asian storytelling more. It\\'s just more like actual life.',\n",
       " 'One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is \"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children\\'s games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake\". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?Firstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.I also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.Another reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother\\'s card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.Unfortunately, the same can\\'t be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don\\'t feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game.Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.',\n",
       " \"I've watched the whole lot and it's just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all.

       " \"A nice drama but with bad unrealistic endings in the last 2/9 episodes. The VIPs are rotten wasting stories!The starting is smooth nice to the middle but as it get long, it became average interesting only. If they did not conclude so so simply made endings, I will give 9/10. I can only give 8/10 which is considered good to watch. Furthermore, it's only 9 episodes so luckily not a long drama because the last 2 episodes were too awfully produced.\",\n",
       " \"It's really not that good, highly predictable and the ending was terrible.I will say though, the main character and his acting wasn't too bad, enjoyed watching him, but other than that, it's a waste of time.Anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series.\",\n",
       " \"First of, I am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-English movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world.The concept of Squid Game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives.The main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no VFX are used and the sets were actually built.It starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there's some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds.As we get to the finale however that's a different story, not only it's an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn't make much sense based on the previous events..Without giving any spoilers, the main twist it's not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show.Also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds.Still I did enjoy it for the most part, I don't think it's overhyped, they could've made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless.\",\n",
       " 'I liked it but the last few episodes were too slow so I had to watch them at 1.5X speed. All in all, it is an odd and entertaining series nicely designed but not as unique as some claim. I do not know if the actors were poorly directed, if they are bad at acting or if it is a cultural thing but I thought many of the characters were overacting.If you have seen The Hostel franchise, Funhouse, The Maze Runner, Battle Royale, the Saw franchise, you will recognize a lot in this series.

       " \"I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It's not just filthy rich making poor fight.I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it.\",\n",
       " '*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants\\' lives.Now, that\\'s all well and good. Who doesn\\'t love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would\\'ve made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn\\'t the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that\\'s it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don\\'t worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what\\'s his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn\\'t even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he\\'s only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN\\'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT\\'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder \"How bad are things in South Korea right now?\" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn\\'t actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn\\'t write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren\\'t bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I\\'m just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don\\'t understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn\\'t even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn\\'t you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it\\'s damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let\\'s do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun\\'s gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I\\'m getting tired at this point, so I\\'ll just leave it at that.If you don\\'t give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that\\'s something that interests you, watch an episode or two.',\n",

       " 'I think any review and ratings for movies is reflective of the theme of this series itself. Is this series worth 10? Clearly no. But many will give it 10 for 2 reasons.1) Gore addicts. 2) Go with the hype.In a clear objective analysis. This series started out extremely good, original, and with very deeply moving and captivating backstories. However by about mid point, like many other series, they ran out of ideas and became cliche, just another Hunger Game, Saw, etc... remake.That being said, for the first part at least, I would give it a 10. The 2nd 1/2, is clearly a 5 and a balance of 7 to 7.5. Rounding down because of certain plot holes and inconsistencies which I will address here.1) Most of the game staff\\'s reactions through the series were puzzling and inaccurate. Everyone signed a contract and death waiver, so technically speaking, everything they were doing was legal. So why were they afraid of the police? Why overly secret? The scene when the front man realized a police was in his office, he pulled out a gun to hunt him. Why? They technically did nothing wrong. If anything, pulling out a gun to threaten the police made them wrong.This was clearly demonstrated in episode 2 that they even allowed the players to vote out of playing. They had no fear of any legal repercussion, yet then why rest of the series they were so worried about it? It is an error in their fundamental logic of the script.2) A lot of Koreans preached about how this is a series addressing income inequality in South Korea, maybe the whole capitalist world. Yet, in the film, every single player was there for a reason and not because they were victims. The main protagonist himself gambled away his money, despite having bad luck in the employment. He may not have a luxurious life, but his massive debt came from gambling and borrowing money from loan sharks.His best friend was even worse, a white collar criminal that embezzled from his clients, created fraudulent documents, etc... from \"bad investments.\" Cough cough, you mean pyramid schemes? From his character throughout the series, he was not a moral man, and revealed to be a psychopath. So he was there despite the fact he was not from the lower part of the wealth range.3) The night time massacre scene was either one of the most brilliant writing in this series or the worst, depending on whether it was intentional by the writers. What am I talking about?Either the writers blundered and just wrote in this cliche plot line of how people will turn on each other for money, to survive, and what not. Or ... it was deliberate to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the game system.Throughout the game, the gamer staff dictated an \"equal\" environment of 2nd chance, not only so, but one heavily and meticulously kept accountable. When they found out 1 player was cheating with the staff, they were eliminated and made examples of. Not only so, they observed their 3 fundamental rules so tightly, they even allowed them to vote out the game in episode 2.So the riot scene was out of place, either as a writers\\' blunder again in the inconsistency of the script, or it was brilliantly put in to demonstrate the hypocrisy of their so called game. They claim to have strict equal rules, even a democratic process, but in the end, used monetary incentive, greed, and starvation to thin the herd when necessary and to turn the players against each other rather than against the game staff. Players were suppose to play the games and be eliminated through the games, not murdered in their sleep. There was no accountability when that 1st man was murdered and as such created hostile environment rather than the promise of fair play.All of the sudden, the chance to vote out as a majority disappeared as the players were no longer divided into 2 groups, yes and no, but into multiple self-interested groups. This is... the heart of socialism, which might all along be the author\\'s intent.If it is... it is brilliantly done. Why?Take a step back and look at all 9 episodes. This is what it means then.In the capitalist world, there are winners and losers, there is a wealth gap. What socialism does, is preach to those who failed in the capitalist world, by their own hands, and a promise of a \"2nd chance,\" a better system, under the pretense of equality, a democratic process, accountability, and social order.However, in reality, all of this was done at gun point and the people, though voluntarily there, were there without choice because their alternative is go back to their failed life in the capitalist system. The socialist system itself is a deception, instead of order, they actually created chaos and pits people against people through greed, starvation, and manipulation. The people, which originally had a choice to democratically end it, then becomes enemies towards each other, losing sight of the real enemy that put them there in the first place. In the end, even if you win in a socialist system, like the protagonist, you really lose. The only real winners? Are the socialist creators.This is socialism\\'s core, what happened in many countries throughout history such as North Korea, China, Venezuela, and what is happening now in many western worlds, including the USA.',\n",

Starting with episode 7, the series starts to drag, and the ending is disappointing.Some details are far from smart (not to say plain dumb), but those details are minor enough not to cause stumbling.Overall, it's worth watching.\",\n",

Which is to say, If u can\\'t stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it\\'s not something original and groundbreaking. As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane. The baddies are not that bad (at all!!).

There was positive as well as negative buzz regarding the violence.After watching through the show in the last 3 days I can say that the show is interesting in some aspects but has issues in others.The acting ranges from good to outrageously bad for some of the characters. The sound and visuals are pretty solid.When it comes down to the writing it's a bit of a rollercoaster as there are good and bad things there as well. I didn't really like the characters and some of the games presented were poorly thought out in terms of the rules and the characters didn't notice these issues which then made them act stupid.The ending of season 1 is rather open and like with many shows leaves room for a season 2. The question is whether or not they can make season 2 also interesting because I think we have seen the best twists the show has to offer in the first season.Also looking at the shows as a whole I can get behind the message it tries to deliver even with the problems.\",\n",

You have your standard character developmental checklist which is desperation, greed, boredom, curiosity, evilness and pure disregard that builds a cast of characters.

She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents. What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents. The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going. It's not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality. 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother's throat to get out of. What a warm and fuzzy thought!\",\n",

       " 'I am an ardent follower of the Korean movies. Even though most of the movies are laden with violence, gore and bloodbath, the chills and thrills of most of the movies I have watched till date have not disappointed me. But I was a bit apprehensive of watching a Korean web-series even though it is insanely popular and one of the most trending shows in the recent past. The very name Squid Game , the latest offering from Netflix did not appear to be very much appealing. However, I risked my time on the rave reviews the show is getting. And boy! It has paid back. I cannot recall any single show more edge of the seat than this. Yes, there may be better shows in terms of intrinsic production values. But if you ask me to select one show where even for one second, I could not hold my breath, it was this, it was this, nothing but this. Normally my hectic work schedule does not allow me to binge-watch a show. But Squid Game eventually turned me to a Binge-watcher. It is so much enjoyable, spine chilling and mind bending.It is believed that even if ghosts exist, the human beings are capable of making this world even a more ghostly place than the original ghosts would do. Basically, greed, lust, lack of control, survival instinct, desire for power and authority, insanity make people do macabre things and when people get the taste of blood, they become even more dangerous than the man-eating animals. Squid Game captivates human emotions to an extent you are awestruck. The level where people can stoop to, to make things shinier for his own life will make you sick as you watch episodes after episodes of this brilliantly made series. The raw violence and gore trademarks of the Korean style of moviemaking is present throughout and this makes the show unsuitable for the children even though the central theme is based on the games played during childhood. In the age of Super Computers, when people have stopped playing those forgotten games any longer, a group of losers are seduced to play six rounds of those games. Winning will guarantee them freedom from every debt as the rewards of winning are astronomical. But the punishment for losing is what makes the series so very horrific, gruesome and rewarding- death. How the real-life losers vie with each other to redeem their own lost hopes is the plot of this super paced series.The show is full of metaphors. It may be worth mentioning that of late numerous movies have also come up with the portrayal of the absence of an egalitarian society in South Korea. The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. Remember Parasite and the subtle show of class struggle therein? Squid Game also tends to point fingers to the inequality prevailing in the South Korean society. Few references to the illegal immigration from North Korea are there, too.Squid Game in may ways is similar to one movie I watched long back- Exam. There also the creator worked on the same concept and I liked that movie. But in Squid Game, the dividends are more rewarding, scintillating and thrilling. I simply cannot recall a single dull moment in the entire show with a runtime of around eight and half hours. The lead actors especially Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae Soo, Jung Ho-yeon are stunning. The old man (I could not google his name) was fascinating. The script is tight, gripping and addictive. The cinematography is insanely horrific just what the screenplay demanded. The music matches with the spirit of the show. The creator Hwang Dong-hyuk creates an environment that is claustrophobic, ominous and jaw dropping.Overall, this show will haunt you days after you have finished watching it. Remember, it is not an easy watch because of the abundance blood spill. But if you are a lover of the thriller/horror genre, this is a series you have been waiting for years. This is going to make amends for the poor choices Netflix has been making for sometime now. Be a player, watch Squid Game.My Rating - 9.5 out of 10.',\n",

       " \"Squid Game is an interesting and rather gruesome show about a group of financially troubled Korean adults who agree to play a sequestered group a children's games in order to compete for a large cash prize. Little do they know that there is a substantial price for losing, and they soon find themsevles in a sort of Korean style Hunger Games. The main characters engage in a protracted struggle for survival--once the players agree to play, they are not allowed to leave unless a majority of the players agree to end the game. Spurred on by greed (the prize is over 20 million US dollars) most agree to play on to the finish.This series is quite entertaining, but thematically owes much to other recent last-person-standing movies like Battle Royale and Hunger Games. This show is interesting because the characters are trapped not so much by their social class as in the Hunger Games, but rather by their bad decisions that result in their financial desperation. In that sense, the show seems to hold up a mirror to what society tends to do to people--set them in competition with each other and then severely punish the losers. The games are conceptually very ingenious and produce both suspense and interesting moral dilemmas. There's also a number of interesting subplots that I won't give away as spoilers.Squid Game is a pretty entertaining and addictive watch, but beware, it is really violent. There is plenty of suspense and some good characters, so much to enjoy if you are into this genre.\",\n",

That's hardly fair, don't you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial. You mean all the world's class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?\",\n",

After a few hundred are shot down in a game of \"red light, green light\" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they\\'re playing children\\'s games, and why it\\'s all happening, might offer some comfort, but it\\'s all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the \"equality\" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it\\'s so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they\\'re badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this.

First of all this movie shows us the perfect examples of Human behaviors that too in a very practical way.

The screenplay was good but I think it was dragged a bit to showcase the Game scenes and players emotions during gameplay which was good actually.Actually we have already watched this kind of concepts earlier so nothing new in it except those +ve points mentioned in above paragraph. It's wholesome bloodsheds allover this show so it's better if you're 16+ then you can go for it.

I couldn\\'t stop watching it....because the writing is incredible, especially compared to the absolute drek coming out of Hollywood these days. And while the acting leaves something to be desired the characters are refreshingly realistic in the way they react to what\\'s happening around them. There are no heroics, no women who can kick the ass of a guy twice their size, no men who end up figuring a way out of the mess they\\'re in. There are just real people dealing with a horrific situation the way actual real live people would, not the way what passes for real people in Hollywood do. The emotions are raw, the situations are brutal and the good guys don\\'t always win because at the end of the day there aren\\'t any good guys...just people trying to survive but not giving a thought to what it\\'s costing them to do it. Episode six was the absolute high point of the series, it felt like a gut punch while I was watching it, how often can you say that about a mainstream series or movie these days? That episode was some of the best drama, some of the best writing I\\'ve seen in many years and I think it will stay with me for some time.Sorry to say that they couldn\\'t really maintain it after that. The resolution of the cops story line was lame and I\\'m not even sure why he was there at all. I\\'m sure there\\'s something I missed about why his brother, the Front Man, killed him but.... I missed it. The rich spectators were lame; basically tired cliché\\'s.And the end just kind of fizzled. I know a lot of people think the main character evolved during the games and came out a different person but I have to disagree. He was a loser at the beginning and still one at the end. The old man had a very good point in the final episode, every player was there by choice, they all left and, already knowing what it entailed, made the decision to return. Yet the main character seems to want to blame everyone else for his trauma, the old man, the people running the game, everyone except himself because nothing is ever his fault. He hasn\\'t changed, he makes a half-assed attempt to do right by his promise to the female player by getting her brother and dropping him off with his friends mother but he apparently abandon\\'s the girls mother in the north and in the end fails his own daughter...yet again because he\\'d rather wallow in guilt and his own self-inflicted misery that try to move on. He\\'s still a loser....just a rich one.Squid Game is yet another version of a very old and well worn story, the difference is that it made the characters into real people who dealt with what was happening around them the way real people would. That\\'s what makes it better than other versions of the same story. And it makes it light years better than any of the drek being churned out by Hollywood these days. Even with it\\'s flaws I highly recommend it. Just be prepared to be emotionally beaten up by it!',\n",
       " 'This is a simple formula that has been done to death \"poor people being made to do highly fatal games while rich people watch\". By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like \"it\\'s an study of human nature\" etc etc. The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes. This world and it\\'s environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games.

The treatment, social message etc were great. Kinda reminded me of a movie I watched called Platform. But i would stop short of calling it the best. The concept might have been given a bit different treatment but at the end it was still akin to an escape room. The scenario under which the participants come back also sounds far fetched. Ok there could be a lot of difficulties and hardships in the outside world but would someone want to go back to a place risking their lives where they are 99% sure to die. But the show depicts that the people once left the show first time they were so desperate for money that they came back irrespective of the dangers there. Not so believable according to me. The reasoning of the old man why he conducted this game was also kind of ridiculous. But all fine in the name of fiction. Loved the characters otherwise.',\n",

       " 'First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes \"Kamisama no iu tôri.\" It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i\\'ve always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. It\\'s hard to connect with the story and the actors when they\\'re expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from \"actors\" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.Finally: Squid Game could\\'ve been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else. This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. The games wasn\\'t fun (and we\\'ve seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring.',\n",
       " \"I have been very greatly entertained by this series. I would have given it a 10 but I took a point off because of the poor acting from the VIP's and the ending that seemed rushed. I could have thought of a better suited and deserving ending instead of a destructive one. I also did not understand the drastic change of hair color in the end. The subtitles can also be improved. Accurate translations including the slangs can change the effect of any foreign film.All in all, this series is fantastic! It has interesting twists and surprises. It is violent so I definitely do not recommend for kids to watch even though it has kids games in it. The story reminded me of The Hunger Games but also unique in its own way. I would classify this as Horror/Drama/Thriller genre. The character development is very well written where a lot of movies fail to succeed. It is very important to any movie. Episode 7 for me is quite emotional and also 9. You have to be cold hearted not to fight back the emotions of what this episode brings. All the main characters did a great job. I like the mixture of different types of people. Definitely recommend.\",\n",
       " '68/100I finally decided to finishe this show after being on my list for months. I don\\'t have much to say other than to highlight the inconsistency of the script of its episodes, which became extremely annoying after a few chapters.For instance, episode 6 is easily the best episode of the entire series. Right after, you are introduced to one of the worst; it\\'s almost as if you have to reward those moments when Squid Game truly shows its innovation. That\\'s why the ending, although disappointing, I can\\'t be surprised at the fact that it was executed in such a way.Speaking of whether or not this series is truly innovative, it definitely has its own quirky streak, one that the series isn\\'t afraid to exploit almost 100%. Many times these moments may not work for me taking into account the contrasting contextualization that the program possesses but, one way or another, it\\'s still appreciated.Impressive performances by the cast but that can be affected once certain new characters enter.The only thing that really remained throughout the program was its technical aspects. It got to a point where I was blown away by some of the editing decisions the series would make. They would seem simple, but they are refreshing to see for a series with so many \"action\" scenes.Squid Game fully understood how to stand out, which is why it will become one of the most remembered shows in the coming years. However, popularity never meant quality, and this might be the best example of that saying yet.',\n",
       " 'I bought into the hype and watched this mess. I am very confused about what people see in it. I can look past the horrible over acting by the VO artists, stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development. I stuck it out until the end and was completely let down. By far, the worst finale of any series in history.',\n",
       " \"It was good - but no where near as good as all the hype and talk led you to believe. The basic concept - we've all seen it before - but still nonetheless it was okay - I enjoyed watching it, it's a bit over the top and actually fairly predictable - but it was good, but no where near as good as so many people are making it out to be!\",\n",
       " \"Very well done production. It was like a modern day Twilight Zone. Character development was excellent, music/score was spot on and like another important character, and story was well done. It was creepy, chilling, bloody, touching, and emotional. It had a little bit of everything.The very few complaints about it I do have don't outweigh the good points - The acting was a little over-done at times. The voices and lines of the VIPs were way over-acted, the subtitles were very fast and hard to keep up with at times, and the last episode/ ending was just a little too bizarre - it took away from the good parts of the earlier episodes.But definitely watch it.\",\n",
       " \"I hate violence in movies but somehow could not stop watching this. The story is intriguing - a group of down-in-their-luck men and women were invited to play a series of kids' games that pitted their lives against each other for a prize of billions of wons. I couldn't help wondering whether millions of viewers all over the world also have the same question: if you are up to your neck in debt, would you join the game?I guess the reason I kept watching this despite my aversion to violence is because the violence is necessary to show viewers the horrendousness of greed. It shows how evil love of money is, that one would be willing to die for it. This begs another question: how is this game different from the game millions of people play everyday, sacrificing their relationships, health, principles, dignity and self-respect for jobs and other sources of income?\",\n",
       " 'SG is a foray into the callused debauchery of which humans are capable. It builds on \\'The Most Dangerous Game\\' w/ a twist. Here, bored positive-balance-sheeted rustlers devise a game, that enables them to entice poor souls in financial straits, to come out & play. The key is in what the players weren\\'t told, not what they were: 456 competitors may enter, but only one will exit alive at the end. These Tattersalls denizens don\\'t compete, except to bet on the \"horses\" performances... & deaths.SG asks its viewers if they believe humans are good. Not quite, right? I was yelling at the screen like I was back at, well, the races. It isn\\'t a matter of players acting horror-movie-lame, rather, it\\'s their failure to timely process how, at a frenzied Gallop, the race was degrading into barbarism. Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!! Work on the word \"NO!\" Augh! Pleading w/ them has no effect. All viewers can do is watch in dismay.The violence is lurid, but not gratuitous. Author, Hwang Dong-hyuk, stated his purpose: \"I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life.\" He was poaching from the gauntlet of his own fiscal hardships.Kdramas excel at juicing the viewer to extract every wince & gasp. The paddock lined w/ dewy pink, Easter green & childlike trappings is a visceral mocking horror; a real dread multiplier.The players aren\\'t the only losers. The police Ofr\\'s story is grim. Hwang Jin-ho went there to save his brother. Seduced by the power of the dark side, the frontman won\\'t let *anybody* move in on *him*. So he brought his own brother down. That\\'s pain. Frontman actor, Lee Byung-hun, aced an expression of curtailed grief, tinged with guilt, + overt resolve to cantor forward. After all, it was his brother or him.1 - 456, when Kdrama screen writers assign #s to players, they likely have a correlation to their values in Numerology. It\\'s about adding layers of depth & meaning to the script, & not for pushing a belief system. We can easily decode what the writer is announcing b/c varied Numerology websites are fairly consistent. While the definitions, as in astrology, tend to be generalized so as to broaden the application, let\\'s jump in to see if any of the player\\'s #s are messages to viewers.>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & #456 signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach a #456 how work harder on oneself and add value to life. 456 picked up 001 as a gganbu trainer, evincing that, plainly, moral fortitude is no prerequisite.>218 is Cho Sang-woo, 456\\'s \\'friend\\' who worked up from the \\'hood,\\' to being a whilte-collar hood. To a point, he mirrors 001. This loathsome in-runner surprisingly gave up the fight, but not before becoming a murderer. #218 is for manifesting one\\'s biggest & on the face, near impossible desires (💰) into reality. Business, duality, & serving humanity must coexist. 218 knows that 456 will serve his mother AND humanity w/ the 💰. 218 failed in his run to win that💰, but he found redemption in his last moments.>067 is Kang Sae-byeok, from NK, who strives to protect her family. No surprise: #067 signifies home, family, unconditional love, responsibility, sacrifice & service. Creating a solid foundation for the future, & protection of family & possessions is a #067\\'s priority.>001, the old man, is most positive when pacing for work. #001 is, recognition for 1st place; it represents independence, but can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>101 is gangster, Jang Deok-su. A #101\\'s primary function is romance, w/ importance of relationships right behind. At first blush this doesn\\'t fit w/ the character, though he did get involved in a quasi romantic trist. Let\\'s flesh it out further.A #101 needs coexistence. Without it, a #101 is alone. People w/ that # can feel lonely & lost just thinking of being alone. 101 obviously grew up w/o basic needs & training, leaving him consumed w/ bitterness & ill-prepared for rigid competition. #101 also points to eternity & the journey that is about to begin w/all its uncertainties. It\\'s a reminder that we are not in control of our destiny, God is, so #101s should follow the course & learn before their time on this plane is over. It\\'s sad to think that 101 didn\\'t get emotional support or the care needed for success. He is still responsible for his infractions, but it\\'s sad, none the less. He parallels the VIP who was attracted to the cop. They both had the same expression of shock, disbelief, & the beginnings of acceptance, when facing death.>199 is Abdul Ali, one of the worst upsets of the show. #199s are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda. For Ali it\\'s providing for his family - independently. A #199\\'s goals virtually never conflict w/ humanity\\'s survival & long-term well-being. We see that Ali is good, albeit naive, & foolish to be so independent that he\\'d wager his life on a long shot to try & provide for his family.>212 is Han Mi-nyeo, the \\'crazy Mare\\' who brought down 101. #212s frequently chase curiosity & adventure, and ALL new, shiny objects, often on a whim. #212s can be good team member & their energy can be sensual. Jumping the fence may lead to negative outcomes. Enroute towards goals, they can face harsh obstacles. An add\\'l similarity to 101 is that only the negative interpretations are exhibited by them. Their harsh lives had severed them from the positive elements w/in themselves. They portray ruthlessness, but there is a forlornless about them, too.>111 is the doctor. A #111 won\\'t let himself be slotted into a team member role, unless the role is real leadership. They haven\\'t been broken. If #111\\'s thoughts are negative, it could attract toxic situations & people.>240 is just released from prison for putting down her abusive \\'sire\\', \\'Philly\\' Ji-yeong. #240 is about nurture & mutual support w/ a high focus on security & the future, all provided without expectation of return. She went underfoot for 067, & thus negated the lie the VIP\\'s tell themselves about human nature. Having already sacrificed her freedom to deliver justice to her mother, 067 is the moral center of the show.>244, the pastor: Spiritual advancement can be phenomenal in a #244\\'s life. He must keep wrong at bay & not offend the inner energy installed by his maker.>The husband/wife duo is portrayed in #69, or two identical digits facing & complimenting each other to make a whole. If we squeeze 6&9 together we can make an 8, which, toppled, is the eternity sign. In addition, the visual aspect of the # is related to ying&yang. The energy of #69 is best when involved directly w/family or team as an equal. Freakily, #069 symbolizes the closure of a chapter in life & encourages one to be prepared for traumatic phase. Whether ending good or bad, it is bound to bring a huge change. Be prepared for it, b/c the the manner in which it\\'s dealt with will effect one\\'s future.Finally, upon the runners\\' return, in EP3, 187 players re-enter the stalls: The US police code for murder.Getting chills?Oh, these \"poor,\" rich, hacked-up GOONS. Their lives are so empteee. Sigh. Studies show around 21% off CEO\\'s are psychopaths. It\\'s not a stretch to guess that some of these fulsome degenerates are in that club, given their heightened sadism. These reprobates can\\'t seem to notice through all the haze of pride, that people are most gratified when we help others.001 didn\\'t get what he wanted by hosting SG, which was a panecea for loneliness & boredom. It seems he & the VIPs justify their actions by deluding themselves that they are conducting a social experiment - Reassuring themselves that everyone is as cutthroat as they, leads to pitting people against each other. This enables them to inveigle their own selves that those people deserve to die: \\'Just look at who they really are! It\\'s voluntary... Anyway, they all get a fair chance.\\'In the end, the old man had the whole world, but was utterly unsatisfied. Craving the comraderie he\\'d had while growing up poor, he felt that kinship w/ 456, even though 456 eventually betrayed him. At the time, 456 even had a second chance. He could have done the all-or-nothing, but refused. That plot point of betrayal, while needed, was his worst moment. The old man was playing him all day to tempt him, but he meant it when he called 456 his gganbu, or close buddy.The kinship manifests itself when the old man wants to see HIM at the end of his life. 456 is there, bedside, when #1 dies. Where\\'s his wife? Where\\'s his kids?? Where\\'s his grandkids??? Can I get a mistress? Nope. Just 456 & an aid were there. Next, 001 saves 456\\'s \\'life\\' a second time, by jerking 456\\'s bit toward living, rather than merely existing.456 is who he is. He wins 3x\\'s in the show\\'s run, but even when he wins, he\\'s a pathetic loser that barely stumbles over the line. In winning, his soul was put-down. When he went to see the old man in the penthouse, he won their game, but he again, didn\\'t get what he wanted, as 001 died before 456 could kill him. It did wake 456 up. He no longer has to feel guilty about flashing a laser in the old man\\'s eyes during the race: His regret is not shipping 001 off to the dog food plant himself.The red hair broadcasts that he\\'s now either on fire, or starting to blaze his trail. Finally. This is not over. We need a season 2. The question has not been answered yet. #456 is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. Here\\'s my ante-post bet & hope: In S2, he\\'ll be stallion #789 who tramples out the ghoulish fraternity of gamers.Quote:\\r\\nGood rain knows when to fall -Du Fu-IMHO~>\\r\\n🎭8 🎬8 🤔8⚡8🎨7🔚9\\r\\nFor age 15+',\n",

I tried to plead with them: Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!!! Work on the word \"NO!\" Augh! The players do soon understand that the only rules that apply are the ones that they are explicitly given by the referees. The penalties for running out of the basepaths are, Umm... Severe.The first two episodes focus on the wild swings 456 experiences when his journey begins.

We\\'ve been waiting for you;) Just relax, you should achieve your subtitle fitness almost immediately. The whole world is watching our entertainment deposits that way. If you can\\'t diversify, they win!K-dramas excel at withdrawing every possible wince & gasp out of the viewer. In general, the writing, directing, acting, & overall play are consistently supplying returns on investment due to the high quality of execution. So much so, that they\\'re in danger of their stats being overlooked. Korea\\'s got talent.SG is more of the same. It is superb dressage, or pagentry. This particularly applies to the horror genre, which is loaded with dumbed down characters& dialogue, lots more blood& guts, & an extraordinarily evil feel to the substandard works. A de-worming & thorough muck-out is in order. SG blows the whistle on those foul circulations. The violence is jolting, but not gratuitous or meaningless. There is a message for us.Yet, K-Dramas, like Simone Biles, can twist professionally, with beautiful strength. K-Dramas spiral the knife into the viewer\\'s psyche with disciplined follow-through. The absolute demented sickness of using the innocent color pink, with other pseudo-cheerful colors, (that also resemble many medicines, such as Pepto Bismal) plus the kiddie trappings (such as the giant doll) is all nauseating. It a dread multiplier.K-dramas also tend to drop players on the audience that are the most extremes of themselves in the beginning of the shoot. A multi-episode show allows ample time to invest in talent to improve performance & yield gains. Just remember that most of the people you see on the screen will either dramatically transform, or the audience\\'s appreciation of them will change, as the series matures. You may squander your currency backing a failing commodity, while another\\'s performance might lead your fantasy team to victory. 456 is pathetically & painfully a substandard performer of the worst sort: over 40, living with mom, swiping her money to go gambling on horses... Has he ever been bullish? Not likely. He\\'s thoroughly contemptible, & relegated to the penny stocks. I was aggravated at the thought of up to 9 innings/episodes monitoring his performance. It was doubtful he would gain any interest.Every competing \"horse\" has a number. If Korean screen writers assign numbers to jerseys, or saddlepads, it\\'s likely said numbers have a commodity backing their values in Numerology- This is not meant to be an endorsement, it is to forensically decode what the writer is announcing in the stadium. Definitions in Numerology, like astrology, tend to be generalized. This broadens the applications, & provides a utitly player that can rebound into several positions. Having said that, Let\\'s see if any of the numbers the author assigned have any credit values...>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach how to learn to work harder on oneself before other things. Hard work will add value to life.Check.

It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. This number represents independence, but this can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>199 is Abdul Ali. 199\\'s are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda, which, for Ali, is providing for his family on his own. #199\\'s goals virtually never conflict with long-term human survival & well-being.Check, check, check, again. And on it goes.Getting chills? If not, you probably haven\\'t seen the show yet. Just wait until you do. The strategy trotted out is medal-winning. Just be woke about what the show is about. It is not about displaying incidental, cheap, & meaningless horror for the purposes of titillation. SG is a metaphor for the writer\\'s own hardships in a cruel, uber competitive & heartless society. The players all represent the downtrodden, like geldings in irons.Most of their backstories, if broadcasted on GoFundMe, would get scouted for assistance. I\\'d be tempted to contribute to several of them. Even the criminals are subtley shown to have been wedged into their life choices. Delving into one gangster\\'s number (101) exposes his basic needs that clearly weren\\'t met in his life. It played a role in his projected gains & losses.K-dramas are also wont to lob surprises, or deferred options the viewer didn\\'t account for, into the works. Expect that not everything is what it seems to be. Avoid being roped in by Ponzi Schemes.This is not over. We need a season two. The question has not been answered yet. 456\\'s number is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. To the extent that he accomplishes anything, true to form, he would barely get a neck over the line. Heres my ante-post bet & hope: In season 2, he\\'ll be the stallion that tramples the game runners as a #789.Apologies for mixing monetary, equestrian, & sports metaphors over here.

Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture.I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn't love it like some are. It's yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style. It's not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing. Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing.This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio. We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles. But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes. So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs.And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)..... it is AWFUL. Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices. I know some don't like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion.\",\n",
       " 'You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked...\"Can money buy you happiness?\". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN\\'s exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?There\\'s just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly.

I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can't wrap my head around the hype. Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc. So I'm thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it's new or innovating.Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there's only one winner.In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste. Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not. I didn't enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. I'd suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be.\",\n",

The games themselves are fun, yet sometimes sad to watch.....you will know what I mean when you get to the marbles game......no spoilers here! The show gets better as the episodes go on and I found myself rooting for a few of the participants. It's a fun show to watch, but the cruelty of humankind is just insane. The lengths people will go to survive is real and sad. I watched with subtitles because dubbing is always terrible and takes away from the characters in my opinion. Overall, I would recommend this show as it's very different from anything out there and after episode 3, keeps you in your seat.\",\n",
       " 'The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a \"battle royale\" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn\\'t matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a \"good heart\" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don\\'t matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are \"forced\" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, \"we can win this with everyone still alive\". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a \"final boss\" enemy in the show.I won\\'t spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of \" saw that coming\" and \"give me a break\" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further.',\n",

       " 'Very similar to \"The Running Man\" (1987) in plot, although it plays more like \"Battle Royale\" (2000) and \"The Belko Experiment\" (2016).The whole story starts with a broken loser getting contacted by a guy that knows absolutely everything about him (in an almost supernatural way.) He invites him to play a game, which would reward a humongous amount of money to the winners (if there are more than one winner, the money is divided amongst them, inciting them to try to win alone.)When playing the first game, though, the players find out that losing means dying (or getting killed!) Obviously, people freak out and a lot of them die immediately. After that, people vote to go back home, without any prize.Episode 2 is dedicated to show the survivors that their lives are hell on earth, so many of them decide to go back into the game. That was at the same time the best episode of the whole series and the worst: a whole episode filled with fabricated drama, to built backgrounds for many characters, which prove to be absolutely meaningless later on, because the story simply ignores their psychological profiles and life baggage, making them act and react at the necessity of the plot.Key characters\\' personalities change \"sides\" just too many times along the series, at the will of the writer. For instance, the protagonist starts as a jerk, stealing money from his mother (for gambling, nonetheless,) then becomes a soft-hearted man, trying to connect with his daughter and save everybody, then becomes a jerk again, trying to save himself at the cost of others\\' lives, then soft again, then jerk, and so on. Especially in the last episode, his changes make absolutely no sense whatsoever.Before his last friend dies, she asks him to promise to go look for her brother, but he doesn\\'t promise (in a \"I won\\'t promise, because we are both getting out of here\" kind of moment, although not actually voiced that way.) When he\\'s out, he enters jerk mode, effectively not going after her brother for a whole year.Anyway, his girl friend is killed by his ex-best-friend-forever, so, obviously, the protagonist is forced into jerk mode and tries to kill his ex-friend-turned-arch-enemy... Until he has an opportunity to win the game and let him die... Making him go back into soft mode... Then his ex-best-friend, for absolutely no imaginable reason, kills himself (in a \"if I don\\'t die, we are both going to die, so I better kill myself, because you bozo won\\'t let me die\" moment...) Game over! The protagonist wins, time to go home, in jerk mode, of course, for reasons.Then, another plot twist, shamelessly copied from \"Saw\" (2004): one of the protagonist\\'s previously dead friends was not dead at all, he was the mastermind and game master! After a long and boring speech, which is basically a Korean translation of the final speech from \"Saw III\" (2006), the protagonist enters soft mode again and go after his dead girl friend\\'s brother (something that makes absolutely no sense, as she had never said who or where he was, because she was very secretive about her past, having escaped from North Korea - even her name was kept secret!)BUT (yes, a huge \"but\" there) he was in false soft mode! After getting the boy out of the orphanage he was kept in, he ditches him (and a case full of money) with the old mother of a dead friend and disappears! After that, he enters actual soft mode and gets a ticket to fly to meet his daughter, whom he supposedly loved so much that he decided to risk his life getting back into the Squid Game (to be fair, he also did it to save his mother\\'s life, whom he finds dead after he goes back home, but two wrongs don\\'t make one right, right?)BUT (oh no, another plot twist!), on his way to the airport, he meets the guy that recruited him to play the Squid Game...! And does nothing about it! He continues on his way to the airport, because he loves his daughter, right? Apparently, wrong! As he\\'s boarding the plane, he decides to pick the recruiter\\'s card and call: he wants revenge for what they did to him, and he\\'s mad, and he\\'s back in full throttle jerk mode...! What, again, makes absolutely no sense! The mastermind is dead, so whoever is the game master has absolutely nothing to do with him! Besides, he voluntarily decided to enter the game, so, if any one\\'s to be blamed for all that happened, it\\'s himself!Except for one game (tug-of-war), all others are amazingly lame and people die for nothing, just to advance the plot toward the scripted lame ending.The random changes of heart of the characters made me want to finish watching the series just to get over with it and never look back. Aside from the protagonist\\'s soft/jerk mode switching, what happened to his ex-best-friend-forever was probably the worst character development I have ever seen. In the beginning, we are made to believe he\\'s a nice guy with a truck-load of bad luck. Then, when he\\'s back into the game, he secretly tries to kill all of his friends, for absolutely no reason. To make it very clear that the first time was not a mistake or misunderstanding, he does it again and again and again till the final game.Because of all those completely random and irrational changes, I was simply unable to hate the ex-best-friend or sympathise with the protagonist! All I could see was a stupid writer forcing the characters to push the plot forward, against logic and common sense.And talking about logic and common sense, did I mention that the Squid Game is a secret organisation? Well, it is, kind of obviously. As mentioned before, the \"people\" behind it have an almost supernatural knowledge about everyone and nobody outside have any knowledge about it/them. Even so, the series introduces a subplot twist: there is a secret organisation operating inside the secret organisation, stealing and trafficking organs from the people that die in the games, without anyone in the Squid Game society noticing! Later, it\\'s revealed that the Squid Game society actually knew that there was an organ trafficking group working behind the scenes, what makes even less sense, because how could a secret society infiltrate inside an even more secret society, and why would that society let such a huge liability operate freely inside it?The best character in the whole series is a random police officer that collects the protagonist\\'s report about the Squid Game society when he gets out the first time. Despite not believing in his seemingly absurd story about a secret society playing deadly games, he tried to help him in all ways he could.I\\'ve heard that there will be a second season, but I don\\'t want to watch it, because the protagonist is a schizophrenic jerk, the Squid Game society is made of dumb jerks (making people outside necessarily even dumber, as they can\\'t figure them out) and the writer knows absolutely nothing about character development. Even if the producers would fix all those issues, what I absolutely doubt, the series would still be completely unwatchable, because either the protagonist stays the jerk anti-hero he\\'d been for most of the first season, or he\\'ll be the jerk superhero, that abandoned his daughter for revenge, who he seemed to have become in the last few seconds of the last episode, that is, either way, he\\'ll be a jerk.',\n",

And the idea of deadly children\\'s games is unexpected and refreshing. With each death of the main characters, some do feel sadness and disappointment. However, the tv series is not perfect, with my ability to predict who will win, who will be betrayed, and who is behind it all. And let\\'s be honest, many of us were rooting for another person to win the prize. Anyways, I hope there will be a season 2, with the \"cliffhanger\" not being that shocking.',\n",
       " \"Didn't expect to see exactly that what the movie is, but that was just the pleasant surprise. I like the idea of the people target to play the game, how they refuse, yet reinvolve - there is a message already in the first two episodes. As for how the show goes - good acting with great selection of casual-looking people, it holds its Asian manners, which is also his charm - brings their specific craziness and cruelty even, yet at some moments it is funny just as they can do it, but it is not a comedy at all. The entire show intends to bring a message, even after the outcome, it is a nice thing after so much gore.

There is a very linear story line, people in a lot of debt get invited to play some very basic games. Twist is, they get killed if they don't win. That's it. There is some initial shock during the first game, but that wanes as the series progresses. There are a some semi-interesting, but predictable back stories, and most of the characters have few, if any redeeming features, so you don't really care who survives. It is easy to be seduced by the initial shock of the first reveal, but it really doesn't progress much from there. I'd recommend. Midnight Mass on Netflix if you want some real horror.\",\n",

       " 'Squid Game is such a successful show that presented one-of-a-kind filmmaking elements that were never seen before. From its unique story to its visually stunning shots, the show deserved everything it got.The show really presented a powerful dramatic topic in the most beautiful way. You constantly be asking yourself who is right and who is wrong?. You get to see the different emotional decisions that characters have to go through to either sacrifice their lives or defend and protect themselves.Really loved how the show manifests the different characters and the diversity between them. It doesn\\'t focus on one character, it rather focuses on around 7 different characters. You get to see the old, the young, the poor, the rich, the female, the male, and even the husband and wife. This makes the story even 10x better as we get to see everything and everyone\\'s decision and how they react to these different games.I feel like the show was better when it was mysterious. As soon as things started to get revealed to us, the show lost itself and that mysteriousness vibe that it was offering. But, at the same time if things kept being mysterious, then the questions would\\'ve never been answered so the show would\\'ve been even worse. The show had plot holes and things that just didn\\'t make sense at all. Like stupid decisions made by characters, or stupid character developments, or cheezy lines like the ones in \"English\" (and not Korean). Like why not keep everything in Korean?! Why do you have to add English dialogues and characters?!. But on the other hand, the show offered us many elements that covered these bad plot holes and made us not think about them as much as we think about the good stuff. For instance, the visually stunning set design with its beautiful colors that are matching perfectly together and with each game that they were playing especially they are meant to be for children so the bright pinky colors explain all of that. The custom designs as well alongside the masks gave that scary, suspense, and thriller atmosphere.The acting is beyond amazing. Each actor presented the dramatic side and life of their character perfectly and their acting plays a huge part in how we were easily connecting with each character. The acting of the VIPs was one of the worst things that I have ever seen.The show\\'s 9 episodes are written very beautifully and carefully. This is why they turned to be great. The 2nd episode with its amazing title, \"Hell\" explains every back story. Although it was a boring episode, without it the show would\\'ve literally been nothing and the characters would\\'ve meant nothing. Really loved how the show presented a specific character that was quiet and didn\\'t have any lines in the whole show except for one specific episode and we were easily connected emotionally to that character. It took the writer only one episode to make us connect deeply with the character that was quiet in previous episodes. That is enough to explain how each thing about this whole TV show was written with deep thinking and creativity.Finally, the beautiful music score is composed by Jung Jaeil, the same composer of Parasite (2019). You can hear the similarities between the two. Especially that both of them discuss such a sensitive and realistic topic which is greed, the difference between the poor and rich, and what people are willing to do for \"money\".

First 10 minutes of the show and I really, really, really wanted to punch the guy in the face and turn off the show.The show kinda uses dirty trick to make him less what he was portrayed as and more relatable. This effect was the strongest on 6th episode, Gganbu, which was also the best one out of all 9.In all honesty i had to force myself to watch first 3 episodes and they totally failed to hook me in. I only kept on watching because otherwise i\\'d feel like I wasted 3 hours for nothing. Sunk cost fallacy.I am kind of glad that I did. Kind of.At episode 5 things got slightly better. 6th was the best, the peak of the show and after that it was slow and weird fall. Yeah, episode 7, 8 and 9 were weird to say the least.The issues: The playgrounds and props look cheap. Director tried to imitate \\'hunger games\\'... things (episode 7 onwards) but... boy, oh boy.. It\\'s just bad. Fake blood was downright insulting.. While some scenes were brutally real. Like DUDE, decide. Want me to be grossed out with fake CGI blood stain, or puke my guts out?!The games are weird and some of them make little sense difficulty-wise, while others are made so unfair I just scratch my head \"what was the point other than playing SAW movie on us?\". Seriously some of those games a blender with nails and glass would be safer place than whatever they came up with.Ending, without any spoilers... Here\\'s the thing: Koreans to my knowledge LOVE unhappy/sad endings. It seems they just need to be beaten down emotionally. I seriously do not remember the last Korean movie that didn\\'t end up sad for the sake of sad. And because it\\'s a 9-episode long show, the \"sad ending\" phase is stretched quite a bit. Not gonna lie, I did feel like my eyes got teary, but it was annoying, rather than earned.Should you watch it... Did you like saw (and/or dont mind gore)? If so, go ahead. Do you have netflix?

Because the balance between characters is consistenly changing thanks to great storytelling and it makes you reconsider who deserves to win during the entire show.Second thing is apparently people annoyed by the performances of VIP actors. It's true, VIP actors are really b type movie actors yet they have very short amount of screen time. Therefore it doesn't affect the overall experience in my opinion. If you're a person who has watched many other asian productions like me, it won't be a problem at all. Whenever a British or American actor is being seen on Asian movies (both chinese and Korean), you'll find their performance laughable anyways. Actors here reminds me IP Man 2.

The series' lead protagonists are Seong, sensationally played by Lee Jung-Jae, a divorce gambling addict with a lovely young daughter who is in deep debt to some vicious loan sharks, his childhood friend Cho Sang-woo, superbly played by Park Hae-soo, who was the golden boy of the neighborhood that went to a prestigious business university, and now his wanted by the police for embezzling great sums of money from clients of the company he worked for, a beautiful young pickpocket named Kang Sae-byeok, impressively played by Jung Hoyeon, who needs the money for her baby brother who is in an orphanage, a Pakistani migrant worker, Ali Adul, terrifically played by Anupam Tripathi, who is on the run and is desperate for money to support his infant child and beloved wife, a sickly old man, Oh ll-nam, endearingly played by Oh Yeong-su, who has nothing to lose, and a murderous criminal, Jang Deok-su, memorably played by Heo Sung-tae, who is on the run from killer gangsters. Marvelously directed by Dong-hyuk, it has a truly engrossing screenplay by Hwang Dong-hyuk, stunning cinematography by Lee hyeong-Deok, and incredibles sets.

The bases are pretty well covered. Visually it's like a demented Dr Seuss story. Loved the sets!The bad (or, the picky): the VIP's are stupid with horrible acting, everything the rest of the show isn't. The surprise ending is cool, but the explanation is pretty lacking for a show with tons of detail. I guess they can use season 2 for this. As a stand-alone you have to just accept that someone has the money and imagination to put together such an elaborate and secretive series of games for the benefit of a few bored rich people.

I always expected it to be a sort of highly intelligent game show kind of film but when I finally sat watching the first episode, I definitely know it is going to be another parasite.Again, I don't hate parasite, in the same way, I don't hate this series. Squid game had a good pace with it, not once I felt bored and I really admired the effort that these film makers have put in to the show but, BUT, the series, same as the film, was insanely dark, disturbing and hopeless.I mean, why do you have to create such series and pour in more negativity into this world? Don't you have enough? I think this is the problem with not only this but most of the Korean films/dramas, called to be 'thrillers' these days and the fact that these inhumane shows get widespread acclaim is horrifying and making me question the future of this world.Judgements aside, the series also had major flaws like crappy characters, predictable tale telling and confusing logic. At times, you cannot find motives for a character's action at all. Some characters had no back story, no arc, no depth, even though they were prioritized over other disposable characters.I mean, do these people ever think what will happen if they get killed? With what hope, they are entering the game show? What are the odds' of having multiple winners? Did they really choose to return even after watching a bloody massacre in front of their eyes? Did they really think that these people can be trusted after watching that?Coming to the male lead, Who leaves their sick mom for days/months to play a dangerous game in the hopes of winning money and returns hoping that she would be alive? What are the chances of winning the game (1 out of 456)? Did they really think they will have multiple winners? Which game has that?Do any of these characters live for themselves? If the characters are so sentimental towards their loved ones, why risk their own lives in the first place? Would the loved ones think that the money is better than the loss of their children/parents?Why did the female lead leave her only brother to play the game when she had no debts? She could have lead a good life here in South Korea making peace with her mind that she cannot see her mom again. Did she really think that her mom would be happy after coming to SK and to know that her only daughter is dead? What were the odds that after the escape, her mom would still be left alive in NK? Did she put her entire life in danger, trusting on some blind instincts?Now that I think of this series, there were so many things that didn't make sense or plainly were there to psychologically torture the characters. The series, as parasite did, left my heart with a hollow and I'm stressed out. Like life is not stressful enough.I'm alarmed at the ratings that this weak show has been given and seriously feel frightened of this sadist community, who I know will not dare to kill anyone if the dystopian future arrives. I'll rather take my own life than to play a people killing game like this.\",\n",

I loved it. Until the very last episode. The pacing was off, multiple twists that just didn't seem to fit, and just a tone and feel that felt way off after 8 episodes.

Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery.

And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game?

All main characters' acting are excellent, and the supporting roles like snake tattoo, Pakistan contestants are also competent. It reminds me of Busanhaeng! However, these foreigners VIP acting are so embarrassing.Just a bit strange. Gi-Hoon personality setting difference before and after participating in the game is too much. In the past, he was kind of greedy gambler. However he suddenly ends up like a superhero with full of truth and justice. If you don't want to use the money, it's better to donate it. So comparatively Sang-Woo character is more consistent. All in all, I did enjoy it from the beginning till the end.\",\n",

I had no idea anyone was going to play it with guns so that was wild. Second, camera angles were dope, however shaky camera work some scenes. I also loved the acting and the character development and attachment came so easy with this show. Finally, I loved the story of this show and connections and betrayals. This show was relatable and shows how society in the long run will look out for their own interests while there is still a few good things about humanity as well. Thank you for the show.',\n",

Their acting is so bad that i really wonder if they are truly actors or if there are just white dudes livng in Korea.',\n",

It\\'s a truly twisted yet inventive show filled with amazing performances and terrifying situations.This show truly kept me engaged throughout all its 9 episodes. The characters are absolutely amazing. Each character is truly fleshed out in their own ways making you care about some yet hate others. The acting is amazing. Each actor gives a commented, realistic, and terrified performance, and it feels real. The games too are very fun to watch. Some are quick and fast, while others are slow and terrifying. It\\'s a very inventive premise for a show. Also the show truly made me cry. It\\'s a show that succeeds at making you love characters too much. And that will result in you crying at certain things that happen in the show. The show also just has a real look at what it\\'s like living in debt. It\\'s makes you think whether it\\'s worth it to risk your life to get money.I have but ONE little issue with the show. The first 2 episodes are just a little slow.

       " 'Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It\\'s basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It\\'s basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much \"micromanagement\" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it\\'s really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the \"micromanagement\" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot.',\n",

       " \"Squid Game deserves its hype overall but is still marred by glaring inconsistencies and poor story-telling. One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it. It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning. Seven more things that compromise the story are:1. The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below. Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game.2. The Front Man is Jun Ho's missing older brother. You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent. Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?3. With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?4. A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game. Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo. Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself. This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead. What an anticlimax.5. Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor's guilt, leaving Sang Woo's mom saddled with her son's debt and Sae Byeok's brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year.6. Squid Game started in 1988. Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows. Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters.7. The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America. Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games. How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like. If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator. End scene. Better set-up for season 2 instead of some irresponsible father letting his kid down again.\",\n",

I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue).\",\n",

Now, onto the shoe itself which was an absolute blast from start to finish. Believe the hype, it genuinely is that brilliant and the acting is on point. The characters are very well developed and you start to grow to like certain characters as the series unfolds. It's over the top violence and a little far fetched, but you are watching a TV series for entertainment, not to be educated. For all the 1* reviews. Ignore them. These are people that deliberately don't rate a show because it's popular and trend. Yes, it can be annoying when a show suddenly becomes huge and everyone jumps on the bandwagon, but don't let that put you off. It's one of the best series Netflix has produced in years.

Their backstories were believable and emotional because of the emotions they conveyed (if being watched with original Korean audio + English subtitles, instead of English dub).The artistic design throughout the movie was aesthetically pleasing and creative as color choices in many scenes are intentionally done. And with that being said, the attention to detail carries this show beautifully.The only complaints while watching were the filler scenes; making the show feel as though it's dragging at some points. Some complained about the acting of the VIPs, but I think that was intentionally done by the creators.\",\n",

Plus the acting is terrible, maybe save the old man, the Indian guy and the masked folks as long as they're wearing the masks.Cinematography good though, and maybe there's a great reveal up ahead - but I'm very reluctant to go past episode 3 for the reasons above.\",\n",

Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It's simply because people can't understand what's going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary. One more thing, it was really nice to see an indian actor as one of the main characters in the show. I know It's not a lot, but still it adds a lot of positive effects in the show.\",\n",

So much scope to address the changes in kids habits (from active and interactive physical and outdoor games and the creativity of making up new ones, to iPad and PC screens all day long). And more so, to address the poor dying and struggling to survive to make money that for most is never actually within their grasp, while the rich do nothing but exploit them.

With all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one I've seen to date.

It isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice. That's what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. Sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. This doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. I don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.For starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. This wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death. It doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was. The characters in game didn't. When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.Also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. They are killed at random. The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. It all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. Losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play. Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. As such it's nothing special in the longrun.\",\n",

All other game shows that you can win money and prizes, don't drug you and have masked people. The first game was so stupid. Every single person moved at red light. Ever so slightly, but they still moved. And only some got shot? And all those people still ran after they saw guys get shot when they moved? Are they all idiots? And green light and red light switched on time, but when all those people got shot, it stayed red for awhile. Why? Really stupid. Also you know you can die so why continue playing.

       " 'Some of South Korea\\'s most popular and innocent children\\'s games from the 1970s and 1980s are reinvented as a mysterious survival game with a cash prize of 45.6 billion won for the winner. However, there is a catch: \"Losers must pay with their lives!\"My Thoughts:\\r\\nIt\\'s been about two days since I finished Squid Game, and it hasn\\'t left my mind. I still can\\'t believe I finished all nine episodes in one sitting.The acting is beyond phenomenal, and it elicited emotions in me that I had never felt before in any other show. EVERYTHING about the production value, the plot, the character development, the set designs, was simply amazing. I went into this show expecting to mostly enjoy it and then move on, but I had no idea it would have such an impact on me.Squid Game amazingly combines the carefree, idyllic days of childhood with the harsh realities of adulthood by forcing ordinary people to compete in life or deathmatches to potentially wipe out their debts. It\\'s a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer that\\'s equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing. In other words, there is something for everyone in this show. It\\'s emotional, dramatic, with enough blood scenes to satisfy suspense and thrill-seekers.In a nutshell, according to me, the current buzz surrounding Squid Game is well-deserved. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who hasn\\'t seen it. This is one of my favorites on Netflix right now.',\n",
       " \"This Korean drama shows up Hollywood in every way. By the third episode, the viewer is totally immersed in the characters' struggles, because this is just good writing. Each character is more and less than they appear to be. We have fascinating and necessary back stories, which make the action incredibly poignant. This is not, as many critics have claimed, a gory show. It's no more violent than something like Game of Thrones. Less so, as the main violence is people being dispatched by gunfire. I do think the last few episodes weren't as good as the first ones, but I suspect they're planning a follow-up season, so much was left unexplained. Great show that really explores human nature, both the good and the bad.\",\n",

I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending.\",\n",
       " \"I was very surprised by the quality of the storytelling. This story is like a parable, like Greek mythology, a simple story with a message, to make a point that life is not fair. We are not all equal, luck plays a big part in our successes and failures, and ultimately we are in a state of stupor going about our daily rituals, seeking something we don't have, driven by greed which in turn is driven by the desire to have fun and escape boredom, and some of us will do anything if we are given permission to do it and are rewarded for it. This story of humanity is universal, and can be told in a million different ways. The Squid game tells this story in its own way.I think people are horrified at what humans can do to another person, but history has shown us that time and time again, most people are capable of the most awful things if they are scared, alone, are at one point powerless, and then at another point, given power and rewards. It takes a very special person to rise above this. Very special indeed. And if you think you are that person, you are most likely mistaken. This is why the ending of this series is so unpredictable, because out of the ashes, from the depths of despair, can arise a person who is not compelled to be bound by the arbitrary rules set by the powerful, someone who makes all the difference to others, who can see the truth, at last. It is no accident therefore that the writers have juxtaposed religion here and there and 'Jesus?' is asked at the right moment. Very clever in all respects. Thank you to all involved.\",\n",

Squid Game seems like Money Heist of an alternate darker reality. But I enjoyed it. I hope the series does not get milked much. The acting performances were good, I liked how the games were simple yet ingenious.This series, I believe took heavy influence from old movies like Cube and Exam. Exam is a really underrated flick and I could sense the influence in the finale.I believe you can give it a watch and climb the hype train. It has comedy, gore, tragedy etc a complete package but it's not a must watch. I think it will get renewed for a Season 2 but after the finale something felt amiss hence I am giving it an 8.

The V. I. P. S have to be the worst actors I have seen in a Korean show. I can't believe those people even have resumes and all experience as writers.... Can't they tell them to get other talent. Why did the majority of them have to be Westerners as well ???So after this was ruined. I looked back. And thought about what I liked.And I have to admit I was blinded by some of the decors and the art direction.There is too much that doesn't make sense , like the side operation run by some of the employeesSo the minimum I can give is 1 star when I rate a title.I gave it two stars because I liked the acting of the character Sae Byeok by Hoyeon Jung. As well as the other girl she paired up with in episode 5 and 6.I decided not to give a star for the art direction as their were some obvious fails to that as well. But I don't think the art department can be held responsible for that.They did have the best lines and writing as well.Really this is not worth your time as well.... just watch battle royale or tag.The shooting of this might have been a lot of fun.

Escher) and a number of other dystopian books/movies that have come out over time. I grant that the way the story is told is somewhat original, and as an example of Korean drama, I suppose it gets a few points for raising that profile....But seriously...WTF!!!!!The dialogue, is addition to being almost juvenile at times, is made even more excruciating by the absolutely horrible, over the top, beyond melodramatic delivery by both the original Korean actors and the those doing the English dub. But even the scenes in English (the VIPS) was ridiculous, so while this may be intended and a normal quality of Korean cinema, it doesn\\'t automatically make it good or even ok. My score of 3 is almost exclusively due to this. It made the show nearly unwatchable. Maybe this makes more sense in the original Korean and would have been better served by English subtitles. I don\\'t know.I also question the premise for the show in the first place. Yeah, times are tough, but would people really be that morally depraved? After the first round when they were allowed to leave, I find it difficult to believe that anyone would come back no matter how difficult their situation was on the outside. And how could anyone ever possibly emotionally separate their \"winnings\" from how they were acquired? And while the \"1 year later\" epilogue does cover this to some extent, I mean really, what kind of horrible, sad, miserable life is Gi-hun going to have? Obviously they\\'re planning a second season, so maybe we\\'ll find out more, but I don\\'t think I really care .Also, as we learn more about the operation of the contest itself, more questions arise. First you wonder how they explain all the deaths. Then when you realize they are harvesting organs, you have to ask why a sudden influx of supposedly anonymous organ donations wouldn\\'t be questioned by someone. And wouldn\\'t there be a sudden flurry of missing persons reported that the authorities would be looking into? I get it.

Honestly, I must admit that is too overrated since there are still tons of movies/series with better quality. To me, the story is not that tense and plot twist is also very average for a survival story.However, what I like the most is the emotional effects that you usually find from a K-drama. As a viewer, I am able to understand the characters' backgrounds till they want to sacrifice their life for money. I mean it is very sensible since you can find it in our everydays' life. Obviously, this is a very good point since most survival stories are not that logical and sensible. Well, we can find a lot of life lessons from Squid Game. I think this is one the reasons why it is too overrated despite the average plot twists.On top of that, I really love the 'A Class' actors as the cameos, it's quite surprising though I wish they could involve more.

Talking about unsuspicious, problem number 2 is how would 456 be kidnapped and no one would notice? Other than that I have no other critic to the story, well done, realistic and interesting.Image wise it is as impressive as a series gets. The sceneries are beautifully well made. Interesting camera angles for a series as well.Lastly I want to point something out, a technicality that I noticed (and like I noticed this one I might have missed many others or there might not even exist any other, I don't know). When they are at the Tug of War, when a team loses they all fall down the bridge. I also noticed that it takes a few seconds for the blade to cut the rope. If putted the pieces together then shouldn't the winning team fall down the bridge as well duo to the massive weight difference, especially when it's a team with 3 women vs one full of men and the team with the women wins (meaning the team with only men is heavier)?To finish, the series is not perfect but it is pretty damn high up there.\",\n",

       " 'My ears rang, the never-ending drone of people clamoring on about a new television show, one that raised their expectations of Korean cinema and the content Netflix sponsors. I ignored it for a while, but the incessant noise could only be filtered out for so long - eventually I gave in. The faint tap of the buttons on my Google TV remote echoed through my living room, the silence almost deafening. I sat there for a while, looking at the cover - what did it all mean? I knew, of course, there was only one way to find out - I had to watch it. I had to steel myself; bend my legs, jump on the bandwagon. For a few moments I sat puzzled, wondering why I couldn\\'t grasp the context; my brain was moving at a million miles per hour and skipped over something integral to my understanding of the media - subtitles. The echoes of the remote could be heard again as I navigated the maze of menus to provide me with context to this global phenomenon, something I had managed to avoid for as long as I could.As I sit there, the darkness almost entirely enveloping me (save for the incredible illumination of the 55\" screen on the wall), I began to sink. I sank further and further, my sense of awareness gently escaping my grasp. 001. 199. 218. 456. The numbers revolved around me, my attention skittering between them. Who do I pine for? Who do I despise? Who do I pity? Who do I envy? Even though my mind raced through these questions, it could never find an answer. No, it could never perform any task in its entirety as it was completely and utterly hypnotized by the reel of cinema rolling before my eyes.Eventually, I came to. I looked at my clock: 3:53 AM. How much time had passed since I sat down? I couldn\\'t remember. I picked up my phone and a steady stream of notifications littered my lock screen. I asked myself a different question - how many DAYS had passed? I had been so engrossed in this work of art I lost all sense of being, all sense of time, all sense of life. And yet, I never felt like I missed something, like I had passed on experiences that would have made me feel some semblance of happiness and joy. My life had skipped two days in the blink of an eye and I didn\\'t feel anything. And despite watching the illegible names of several people I knew nothing about in Hangul gently scroll up, I still continued to think about the event I had just witnessed. What happens next? At the moment, I don\\'t know (though, my mind certainly has ideas). But I can only hope that this phenomenon continues, as my mind couldn\\'t take the hit of knowing this would be the only exposure to something so interesting, something so vile yet gripping.So I say to you - stop reading this convoluted memoir and watch it.

All except the sexual predator, which did add to the creepiness.* The importance of money made no sense to me; yes, poverty is a nuisance, but to have it turn you into a killing machine? Nor did I understand the 1 winner only system. I don\\'t recall it being specified that only 1 person could leave with the money (could\\'ve been made more clear in fact as the main character hopes to leave together with a girl). I personally think it would\\'ve been better and not damaging to the storyline if more people could\\'ve shared the prize merely by making it through all games alive. First of all there was enough money to go around for quite some people. But foremostly because I just don\\'t believe ANYONE except a crazed psychopath would agree to being the single winner, meaning you have to watch everyone (everyone - 500 people!) die. And they chose this voluntarily too, when they came back for that second round. Really, if I handed you a lottery ticket with a 1 in 500 chance of winning but a 500 to 1 chance of killing you, would you take it?* Melodrama on various occasions where less would\\'ve been more.* Like others have said that one screaming, scheming female should\\'ve been toned down (or replaced by a less annoying actress).* I thought the twist at ending okay but the ending after that somewhat daft. He should have just done what he should\\'ve done at the get-go: give a darn about his daughter.* The character developement of the main character was poor. He\\'s a selfish loser in the beginning and just the same in the end. Doesn\\'t go see his daughter, doesn\\'t share some of the money he won with the really poor.

It certainly had me hooked all the way through. So I\\'d still recommend it if this type of story is your thing. The cinematography was great.

For me, it\\'s hard to deny how great the series is - it\\'s filled with compelling visuals and plenty of powerful characters. The pink-suit guards in black masks really draws the viewer in, the look is intimidating yet oddly fascinating and almost mesmerizing, and I believe the most iconic thing about the show (at least visually). As for the acting, Park Hae-soo is incredible as the dubious yet likeable Cho Sang-woo, while Lee Jung-jae perfectly captures the desperation and sadness of the show\\'s main protagonist Seong Gi-hun.

Some illogical occurrences and lapses in a supposedly tightly controlled environment... Some characters seem to overreact all the time while some felt detached and unaffected...\"normal\" people seldom react similarly under duress but a few characters do not seem involved...a few act overly cool towards \"friends\" and a few overly warm towards \"adversaries\"...\\r\\nPerhaps there were too many characters to properly develop but even the main ones aren\\'t \\'likeable\\' enough to root for... And most of the plot became predictable before the half way mark..The acting was the major let down for me and scored between a 4 and a 5.... While there were some great moments yet generally throughout, acting weren\\'t believable... Fear and anger felt under whelming, aggression and obnoxious behaviours seemed overplayed... And some characters over act to clownish proportions...a few of the characters also don\\'t feel consistent, suddenly brave then turn cowardly or vice versa...I found most of the characters unrelatable at many points of the story development... This is partly the fault of the script but the acting or over-acting didn\\'t help...Can\\'t say much more without giving spoilers away...

The side story was particularly laboring and disengaging. The theming is little too blatant and bordering on sophomoric. It's really just not that clever, despite the hype.

Finally, the score really works well with this show and the tone is very consistent throughout.For me though, I couldn\\'t go higher than a 7 because of the, in my opinion, weak twists that happened and the lack of explanation given to some aspects of the story. The final twist was unknowingly foreshadowed with small hints, but the choice of the twist with what we were shown feels kind of forced and pointless to me. The frontman twist went nowhere, leaving you with more questions than answers, and really not much care for that character.

I'm not sure if it was a budgeting thing and they were hired on the cheap as western actors. Or if their performances translated better for Korean viewers, as foreign actors. I doubt it though.

       " \"This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.The only major problem I have with it is the acting.It's not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting.\",\n",

With the added incentive of life or death there is a real intensity to these games which intrigues us throughout.The characters all have unique and relatable motivations and circumstances. They all need money for one reason or another be it for themselves, their family members , debts, etc.The characters surprisingly are very well written and rounded up which is what keeps us hooked right unitl the end and perhaps seperates this show from other violent shows.The show throws concepts of morality in the face of adversity, consumerism, democracy, class separation, gender equality, all very subtly and naturally weaving and fitting into the story without taking any unneccesary stops.It lets you form your own opinion of these concepts and themes instead of drilling its own politics into you.From the standards of storytelling in modern times its Oscar worthy!The ending revelations perhaps felt uninspired even if they were executed well(driven mostly by the actors performances and direction),\\r\\nthe twists and turns ranged from genuinely shocking, emotional to 'Havent we seen that somewhere else?'.Yes the plot twists at the end remind you of Escape Room perhaps even of Hunger Games or Battle Royale but the writing and character development is what elevates the show a notch above.I dont think we need a sequel....the show is clearly one of the best of the year.\",\n",

After doing some research to confirm, I tried to avoid spoilers until I could see it, but in less than 24 hours the entire internet was filled with it. That forced me to abstain from watching the series for a few days until the boom subsided.After finally observing the 9 chapters, I can share the following points. Personally, I really liked the social message that the series shared, of how they gave Korean children\\'s games of the 70s and 80s a dark twist, and the chemistry between the characters and their individual development. I would have easily given it an 8, if not for two downsides.The first was the way the story was told. At first, it was able to take off without any problem but it became unstable until the end of the season, which in my opinion could have been better. Apart from that, the police side-plot must also have been developed better. They gave him considerable screening time, only to stop with a clichéd Star Wars-type moment? I mean, what the heck?The second is related to the characters. Although the characters had good chemistry with each other and a good, but slow individual development, the same cannot be said about the audience; since they felt a bit generic and the charisma was almost non-existent (especially with the main character).In short, \"The Squid Game\" is not a bad series, but I consider it highly overrated from what I had to see.

When he is offered a chance to make a not-so-small fortune by competing against several hundred other desperate souls in a high-stakes series of childrens\\' games, he grabs it--with absolutely no idea of what he has signed up for. At first, there\\'s a repetitiveness to it all--everyone competes, the losers are massacred in a horrible bloodbath, the winners move on, rinse and repeat--and, terrifying as the story quickly becomes, you may start wondering if that\\'s all there is. But then episodes six and seven come along, the suspense is ratcheted up even higher, the pool of players is winnowed down to a precious few, and the action really takes off. (Who knew that an ordinary game of marbles could turn into such a nailbiter?) The premise is brilliant, the acting is magnificent (Jung-jae, with his large eyes and expressive face, leads an extraordinarily talented cast), and the stunt work is amazing. Not for the faint of heart--there are more corpses here than at your local boneyard--but if you can stomach the more cringeworthy moments, \"Squid Game\" is quite a ride.

As much as she has been voted the most viewed in the world recently, I was too suspicious of her potential, thinking that it could be a shallow plot, just a \"popocão\" to marathon. I was wrong.The show is very balanced, it has a plot, it has good characters, and it grips you in a very smooth way, where you\\'re tempted to keep watching, episode after episode.Overall, it\\'s guaranteed fun. The show\\'s aesthetic alone tells us not to take it too seriously, so don\\'t. Skip the details and have fun.Out of respect for the great old series, which were extremely well done, I won\\'t give it a higher rating, but it\\'s a very good series.Good for a marathon on a Saturday after lunch, alone or with others.Rating: 4/5 - Very good series.',\n",

It all just becoming so predictable with every game who would survive and who wouldn't. Especially with the game in episode 6. The moment the game was announced I knew what would happen. That didn't mean it was a bad episode because still, some stuff happens which was nicely executed. But because it was so predictable for me it kind of ruined the great moments.The acting was decent and some of the characters were semi enjoyable.

A more glaring issue is with some core points like the Jigsaw like reveal that I found rather predictable.The ending itself and Seong Gi-Hun's decision is incomprehensible as well. If you just think back to all the games it's clear that he only survived by luck or help or pity from the other contestants. There's really only one game to give him full credit for. Taking this into account his decision at the end of joining the next game doesn't make any sense.Aside from some character inconsistencies or rather incomprehensible acts by some characters like Seong Gi-Hun, Oh Il-nam and Front Man the characters were really great and fleshed out.

Episode 6 was the best one and had some of the show's best acting.The last 3 episodes were really bad and uninspired and clearly just meant to setup a season 2 which is annoying. All the character arcs are thrown out the window, a police officer investigating this deadly game has a lackluster ending, and the reveals.... meh? The 'protagonist' learns nothing by the end of the film, so there's zero character arc.I'll give it a 6. It's entertaining to watch the games and their thought process but I can't give it anymore than that thanks to the lackluster ending. Now an ending can be disappointing but I want rate an entire series on JUST an ending (like Game of Thrones). But the fact this did nothing new at all and flat out copied movies. People are saying some of the above movies I mentioned are fantasy, but there's another movie I can't think of where people volunteer to play for money in a very realistic setting that is basically the same thing...Nothing new, acting is OKAY, some major plotholes or scratch your head moments, and not a good conclusion.

But so many people told me to watch. So I watched.I try to make it simple and I don\\'t make it up.I knew the guy in the black mask was the brother of the police guy from the 3rd episode on. Why would the black masked guy be the only one with a weird voice.I knew right away that the old guy has something to do with the whole thing. It came to my mind instantly. He was the only old guy and kind of wise and all and also in the marble game episode he was the only character not being shown being shot.Yes it was thrilling here and there, yes the performances were good and yes I wanted to keep watching. But to me it was pretty predictable.Every character did exactly what I expected in almost every situation. The bad guy with the snake tattoo just kept being an idiot. The crazy woman he slept with yep being annoying and loud. And so on.And this goes along with every thing in the show.Examples:Marble game again. There is this husband guy who kind of killed his wife who wants to hang himself. He hangs himself. Success. It would\\'ve been funnier if it didn\\'t work and he had to keep playing. Even though I know he wasn\\'t an important character.The glass bridge game. The broker guy who also fooled Ali pushes one person into death right in front of the last step to safety. He pushes the guy, the guy falls down and dies. He jumps and wins. I would\\'ve loved that at one point maybe two of the glass surfaces were to be the weaker ones. That would\\'ve been unexpected. He pushes the guy and thinks he\\'s safe, jumps, but the other one breaks too. WOW. Didn\\'t happen.Police guy trying to escape all the sudden. Why so ever. He looked for his brother, couldn\\'t find him and then leaves. They look after him in the weird tunnel in the cupboard. They follow him. They see that one oxygen divers tank is missing so they assume he went diving. And what did he do ? He went diving. I would\\'ve like that he had maybe hidden one tank somewhere to fool them. Didn\\'t happen.The whole show is just based on its whole premise. Violence and shock. And bright classic music in weird situations. And that just repeats.To me it really went difficult when the \\'VIPs\\' showed up. They were super cringeworthy. I couldn\\'t barely watch and listen to their generic lines. And why would they come to almost the last game ? So they watched people running over a bridge and two guys fighting on a rainy playground. Wow. They should\\'ve been introduced earlier. They weren\\'t even needed at all. If you\\'d take them out it wouldn\\'t have changed anything and it would\\'ve even be more mysterious in my opinion. I doesn\\'t match with what the old guy says in the end and it is also not further explained.And then the show ends with a father not going to see his daughter. Instead coloring his hair red and apparently wants to play again. Instead of going to see his daughter and make it up again. Right.. Who cares about children. She can wait another year. Stoopid kid.I also had a problem with the portrayal of the Arab character. He was portrayed as super stupid, almost retarded. He didn\\'t even know what even and odd numbers are. And his name was Ali Abdul. It\\'s like having a French character and calling him \\'Guy Frenchman\\'.However it was still a lot better than 80% of Netflix stuff.

Around 400 people who have their own financial problems decide to join a tournament, in which they have to play kids games where the losers will be killed. The premise is similar to franchises such as the hunger games, and other violent movies that became popular after that franchise.And throughout the first couple of episodes we get kind of the same adrenaline filled experiences: the games are silly but due to the fact you get killed when you loose there is automatically tension. And eventhough it is pretty clear who will survive the first few games, audience still get what they want; a high body count and enough gore.When the stakes are getting higher, you start to realize that the show has more similarities to 'the most dangerous game' and 'The Cabin in the Woods'. And without going too much into spoilers, the power distance between certain characters is present in all these three names. And soon you start to realize that it is a bold move for an American company (Netflix) to produce such anti-American series. I just wish they stocked with this idea.Unfortunately, and maybe I am a bit too harsh in ranking it this low because of this, they completely flipped the premise on his head towards the end. And everything they build up in the previous episodes is wasted by a cheap plot twist that literally does not make sense at all. Don't get me wrong, the games are fun and there is plenty of tension, but it doesn't add up like The Cabin in The woods ended.

       " 'Squid game is a well-crafted show engineered to appeal to western audience. All the tropes of a running series are found here. The royalty-free music placed near the end of the episode to make you reflect, the constant cliff hangers (which are archaic in the age of binge watching), and the excessive - and I mean EXCESSIVE - investment in character backstory and development. This last trope is particularly obnoxious.At least five episodes are dedicated to the development of characters or establishing their backstory. The growth of the characters are so slow, repetitive and saturating that it makes it hard to become invested in them. It is ironic that you feel more for the lesser characters than for the primary characters.Another point of contention are the games and where they take place. There is such a thing as inspiration, but there is also such a thing as theft. This show borrows inspiration from previous Battle Royale style works (see As the Gods Will it and Alice in Borderland). However, what it borrows in inspiration from one work, it blatantly steals from another. Those who have watched Battle Royale would be able to tell just how blatantly lifted one of its unique concepts is during one pivotal scene in the series. This is not excusable.What is also inexcusable are the actors who portrayed the VIPs. Calling the acting atrocious is a compliment. Their acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like an Oscar contender.The lukewarm observations of ethics, morality and the human condition would appeal to teenagers or forum philosophers, but to the seasoned viewers who have either watched Korean cinema or Battle Royale movies it is as run of the mill as it gets.',\n",

I feel that the \"twist\" ending was predictable as I\\'d thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I\\'m only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the \"intruder\" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering.

       " 'The brand new hype series of the season. Is it any good? With so many commenting about it and the massive number of positive reviews on this website, I dare ask the question everybody feels so confronted when asked: why? If you have seen the show and enjoyed it, please take a minute to consider the reasons for that. I feel like \"Squid Game\" has been given too much credit, and I will try to explain why without spoiling for those who still consider watching it.A few users on IMDb have already pointed out many incongruities in the story, unresolved plot points, character inconsistencies, unexplained details and while all of it is valid criticism, I could easily nitpick any number of flaws with the story, dialogue and characters, and not make a point. Aside from the fact that I don\\'t want to spoil the series, I think it\\'s more important to highlight the general idea of the show and why most plot holes, from small to gigantic, were a problem, instead of just listing them.To begin with, the premise is preposterous and nobody would think that to be feasible, therefore it\\'s unreasonable to criticize the show for being unrealistic. We take what is given to us and suspend our disbelief until further notice. And that\\'s where the issues begin. I can happily ignore certain details about HOW all of it came to be, if those details are never mentioned again. However, \"Squid Game\" takes an approach to its story that confronts the whole idea of its premise, setting it against rational inquiry of the facts shown to us. Simply put, its an absurd story trying to be realistic. Is that a problem? Not necessarily. Take \"The Platform\" for example: The absurd premise is justified by the bigger picture, a metaphor. \"The Platform\" doesn\\'t dwell on the details of HOW it all came to be, or WHO is behind all of it. It doesn\\'t matter, because the narrative structure only serves as a parallel between our\\'s and the movie\\'s reality. Then how does \"The Platform\" differ from \"Squid Game\"? In favor of reliable (read: cliché) plot conflicts, the metaphor aspect comes crashing down in \"Squid Game\". For example, when the masked game enforcers are shown as human, it naturally begs the question: HOW did those people end up there? Now these characters are not an idea anymore, they are people, and people need stories. And guess what? They never get one.That problem repeats itself a number of times, most notably with the main characters\\' decisions, as they repeatedly take actions that are not in accordance with their already established characteristics. When they break character, it is in favor of a simple and predictable resolution to the problem faced. If they were to act accordingly to themselves, the story wouldn\\'t go the authors\\' way. That would create conflicts the writers wouldn\\'t know how to solve, therefore they end up relying on clichés to save themselves from that trouble.The way I see it, a story like this should have taken one of 3 approaches: realistic, fantastical or metaphorical.As a metaphor, \"Squid Game\" could\\'ve worked not unlike the aforementioned \"The Platform\", drawing parallels with the elements of the show and our reality.As a fantasy series, it could have gone down the same path as \"Alice in Borderland\". The realism wouldn\\'t matter then and the mystery would be stronger.As a realistic show we would have something like \"Saló or 120 days of Sodom\". And it should\\'ve felt just as disturbing, after all, both stories are about powerful people playing with the lives of unfortunate souls. But that doesn\\'t seem the point \"Squid Game\" wants to make, after all it puts us in the same place of the evil powerful men in masks: sitting comfortably in our sofas, relishing in the spectacle of violence, anguish and pain. But hey, that could be the point the show is making, right? You are just as bad as those evil men! You are enjoying this show too! But no, \"Squid Game\" doesn\\'t confront you with that notion, like Michael Haneke did with \"Funny Games\". You are to mindlessly enjoy the carnage and ask no further questions. Are you satisfied? Don\\'t worry about answering that. Keep yourself busy. Watch another episode before you have time to ask yourself another silly question.',\n",

Or at least that's the take I can live with. But anyway: don't even get me started on the way Netflix treats their talent. I imagine their top execs are just like those revolting VIPs, more than capable of watching people die for fun.Such a shame that this Netflix fodder will be remembered as the Korean finest, while the real good - not Netflix - stuff, like Kingdom and Train to Busan, will most likely get buried under a relentless pile of total squid.\",\n",

Not a lot of people can relate to that, but almost everyone knows what it\\'s like to be broke (which is what drove him to enter the game, so he wouldn\\'t lose his daughter). Why doesn\\'t the show have the courage to write typical people? I\\'ll tell you why: It\\'s just not smart enough to do it.Twenty years ago, this show might have had something interesting to say. Today, it\\'s just par for the course. We live in the Squid Games. There are poor people right now somewhere who are in the actual Squid Games. If you don\\'t have a gun to your face, you are somewhere else on the Squid Games spectrum, which goes all the way to the other extreme, where losing means hearing the words: \"you\\'re fired\".If you want to say something about the reality of poor people, it better be important. This series is clearly just gory entertainment. In Hollywood, there is greater awareness today that white authors can inadvertently create black stereotypes that don\\'t age well.

However, the ending was terrible, I was expecting much much more, on the investigative side the detective does very little and I was dissapointed that he actually gets killed without mercy and further by the front man, who is his brother, and his side of the story is never told. I agree that would make a good second season material, however, the last scenes where the old man reveals he created the game with his buddies for entertainement purposes, and to relieve boredom with no further purpose, is killing all the mystery and there would absolutely be nothing new for the second season in terms of mystery, just need for revenge. The old man, instead of using his money to do good, he created and apparently participated in children's games, where he bets with his rich buddies and kills the poor men and women who are indebted and obviously need help. Rich people killing poor people just for entertainment, I find it disgusting and without substance. Overrated show and terrible ending. That ending spoiled the second season for me.\",\n",

       " \"First off, this show is worth a watch, despite my rating for it. It is entertaining and gets you hooked (though it definitely won't get you hanging on the edge of your seat). The problem is: the plot is weak, riddled with clichés, and full of plot holes.There is no such thing as a surprising plot twist in this show. After the first couple of episodes, you already know exactly what is going to happen. As I said, it is okay to watch when you have nothing else to see, but, in my honest opinion, it is super undeserving of its 8+ rating and not at all worth all the hype.Here's a small, very limited, list of a few issues I found with it. (ATTENTION: SPOILERS):\\r\\nWhat are the odds that, in a group of 201 people, they would make a vote and that vote would be split exactly in half, with the last one to vote being the tie-breaker? Seriously, I think that the odds of that vote ending 101 to 100 are less likely than the odds of a show like that existing in real life.They talk a big game about how they strive to provide a space that is equal for everyone, and are even apologetic when something doesn't go according to that rule. Well, sorry to say, but if you allow the very OWNER of the criminal organization play the games and not suffer any consequences when he loses, then you are absolutely NOT providing a fair and leveled playing field for everyone. Also, the dude with the tattoo got MULTIPLE benefits throughout the show. Here are a few:1. When someone threatened to kill another player, they would instantly face the threat of being killed themselves by the show staff. However, when tattoo dude kills someone in front of the staff, he suffers no consequence whatsoever.2. Tattoo guy agreed to play the marbles game one way. However, when he started to lose, he cried foul to the staff and they actually allowed him to change the game (seriously, that was ridiculous plot armor for him)\\r\\n3. Whenever someone refused to play a game, they would instantly face the consequences, as people needed to keep playing to provide the VIPs with more entertaining value in the finale. When tattoo dude refuses to play on the glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens to him. Seriously?Anyways, back to the regular stuff:\\r\\nThe plot, as I previously mentioned, is constantly obvious and easy to guess. Everyone knew the smart dude would become a villain, everyone knew that the lady that didn't find a partner for that marble contest would be left alive, and everyone knew that tattoo dude was not going to lose that marble game because he just had the most incredible, unbreakable plot armor in history. It was also obvious as heck that the competition that was in pairs was going to make one character play against the other. And they acted like all of those were like huge plot twists. Do you think your audience is that stupid?There is no real tension that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout the show because the main characters are the only ones that are thoroughly explored, and you either love them or hate them. No matter what happens, you ALWAYS know that the team in which the protagonist is on is going to win, and you can always figure out who is going to win or lose in all contests. In the marble contest, again, they had MULTIPLE opportunities to actually introduce a valuable plot twist, but no. Face tattoo dude lives, protagonist lives, smart guy lives, north korean girl lives, crazy lady lives. You can just see the producers were desperate to keep these characters on because they, themselves didn't have enough faith in their work to think that it would be able to sustain itself after killing off a main character.Another RIDICULOUS plot device was the body of the guard that the police officer killed washing up exactly on the island were they were holding the games, when he threw the body off of the boat in THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. That scene was completely unnecessary and broke my immersion on the show even more.Are you telling me that Ali, a guy who came all the way from Pakistan to live in South Korea ACTUALLY managed to learn how to speak Korean, one of the most difficult languages for non-native speakers, flawlessly and perfectly, but didn't know what even or odd numbers were? REALLY? SERIOUSLY?And then there is the ending. So, this show is going to tell me that that stupid main character, who did absolutely nothing throughout the show, didn't even manage to win it by himself, is now going to take on a whole criminal organization that even has its own island? The dude is going to go from a jackass who can't even wipe his own butt and lives off of his mother's money in his 30s to a John Wick type of guy who can destroy anything he touches? What a terrible ending to a severely underwhelming show.There are many more ridiculous plot holes to be talked about, those are just some of the highlights. However, since this review is already long enough, I'm going to leave it here.Very mediocre show. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to see, but do not believe the hype. 6/10 (being very generous).\",\n",

Is Squid Game entertainment or a warning? And why is it a 15, not an 18? Alien was never gratuitously violent (they were at war) yet an 18 or X when released in the 70s.

It's a study of human nature; a tale of haves and have nots, oppression, luck, desperation, love, friendship, greed and hope. Korean film is so rich in story telling it's simply refreshing. This is an exceptional work of art. I loved so many things about it but the main character and the old man and the successful pride of the neighborhood are spectacular in every nuanced scene.

The plot is quite predictable, the actors make stupid faces and a lot of unnecessary noise and movements. It just got plain silly and boring. Seen this story somewhere, or read some books with similar plots, I do not really remember.

The storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. Going into this, I thought that a show about deadly children's games would get cheesy at points, but boy was I wrong. This show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. There isn't much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the VIP's that spoke English) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional Rollercoaster. Lastly, I'm the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. I can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because I didn't catch a single inconsistency. It seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.This show is brutal, bleak, and doesn't sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche's. It feels authentic from start to finish. Definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch.\",\n",
       " 'First of all, this review will contain heavy spoilers from the get go so stop reading if you haven\\'t watched the show.Let\\'s begin wtih a simple question. Can it all be justified? I am not trying to defend psychotic violence and sadism as well depravity of a satanist-looking cult full of rich boys billionaires but...As the old man finally said the obvious: They did it all on their own volition. They knowingly signed the rules. THEY chose to abide by it.. Further they could put an end to it anytime they wanted with majority voting.Also let us isolate one incident. The pancake game. If we set aside the GI Joe soldiers who - mind you- were always cordial, polite and abided by the rules such as to eliminate those who reveal face or take out the literal trash who chose to break the rules in their little hooligan clique of organ harvest... It remains to a fine testament that a self-declared \\'dimwit\\' loser who lives with his Mother can achieve the impossible - ie solving the umbrella puzzle with a literal gun pointed to his head. It\\'s almost Campbellesque hero\\'s epic and akin to a rite-of-passage transformation of handling a hot iron rod.So despite the psychotic riot mayhem and meaningless killing from day 1, this shows that conditions were more than fair. Afterall no one can take that confidence and self-efficacy he learned under the crucible. In fact, the conditions were \"MORE\" fair than real world.If we buy this lock, stock and barrel.. then it answers as to WHY this senseless violence can be justified. Whereas the cruel outside world kicks people to the curb, here is a perfection opportunity of harmony in anarchy with soldiers in consort with managers acting as the great equalizers.The final window scene was the ultimate culminating point and great capstone to this otherwise bitter critique of capitalism. Yes, many people read the obvious scathing attack on it, and even a Washington Post article highlighted the irony of the fact that they are basking on the same pile of money enabled by the very system they criticized.. But but I don\\'t think it that black and white.If anything, that scene (as well as the previous powerful scene of \\'brother\\' sparing \\'brothers\\' life...) serves as a striking footnote and glaring closure to the triumph of humanity and compassion.Yes, life is cruel. Yes, capitalism enables the powerful and rich to exploit the ones lower at the bottom if not ask for fellatio whilst people are dying like race horses in a bloodsport. Yes, it is a dog-eat-dog world outside....But at the same time like the ever-cliche rose climbing out of stone, so is the power and magic of humanity, hope and love.(And that brings the point even closer to me. I felt I could relate with the protagonist having found myself in a similar situation although priveleged to live in SoCal. But despite living the simple life, I am also aware that eventhough it may seem to be a cruel world out there, it is also a serene one. What would really happen if entire Earth was reduced to a prison as a social experiment? Sans minor glimpses of riots and ever-concurrent wars... human in general are peaceful and righteous. Even though our planet sustains of globalist capitalist economy, look outside the window... Do you see people devolving to their base and depraved instincts? No...Because despite all our flaws, humanity still has the spirit of God within.)Thus in a way, it manages to do the opposite - instead of dissecting the capitalistic eschatology to shards, it drives home the point and highlight that even if human were put in a situation where you are pitted against another for a huge pile-uh-cash, you would still choose compassion over violence. Even if a homeless person is dying on the street, there is still a kind and gentle soul watching over you like guardian. Even if you earn money through a slipknot of violence, you still preserve your humanity and look after those childhood gradnma-aunt who took care of you and took you under their wing like their own son. These.. these values can never be traded no matter how corrupt and diseased our moral compass may seem to reveal otherwise on the exterior. Albeit all it takes a flake of wainscot to break the tipping point and start riots and anarchy as seen from real life and the movie Joker, but under all the seeming inhumanity and cruelty resides a powerful, calm Shiva.On a separate note, this movie also exploded our blinkers as to what Korean lifestyle, culture and movies are about after year after year and movie after movie of kung-fu tropes and what not. It shattered mine at least.. and I never bought the hype mistaking it for being cringy as BTS. Haha...What does blinkers mean anyway...',\n",

The show has some flaws, mainly some unneeded sex scenes and some questionable plot points.

People compete with lethal consequences in quite random and easy games for an enormous money prize. This is how liberals view capitalism and material success - pure luck based on random, worthless skills for the sick enjoyment of the immoral rich.It\\'s somewhat ironic that in Korea\\'s case we have an easy option to see what would happen to it under the \"other ideology\" by looking at the North. Yes, it\\'s easy to imagine a world without competition and money, but I\\'m afraid you need to populate it with either angels or robots.Other than that, as is the case with many Asian films, there are annoying characters that employ overacting as a method to show their emotions, and who at the end you wish to kill with your own bare hands.On a plus side, it\\'s swift action and the level of violence is what you would expect from a Korean show with a cult following in the West.

Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom's vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn't help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead.\",\n",
       " \"I like the way the movie builds the main character.-The supporting characters also have their own story that makes the film more in-depth.-The game steals a lot but is improved.-The later episodes are not as good as the first ones but not too bad-Overrated , but not the problem.Just enjoy. Watch the movie if you're tired of looking for a new movie.\",\n",
       " \"The show hooks you right away on the first episode, but as the climax comes into play along with some supposedly plot twists being revealed, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.The characters don't make sense, especially Gi Eun and Sang Woo. Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. He is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don't get what he's thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It's not within his character to stab himself. He didn't even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok.The reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already.We also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.I had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.In retrospect, I think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. The actors did a fine job, and I think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn't buy happiness then it works out. But this ending? CHEAP.6.5.\",\n",

Squid game popped up mid September, and I thought... maybe!But nope.Now I have to review it because, for whatever reason, it got popular recently.The visuals were great.Therein lies the positives.Now for the negatives.First off, stop calling it a Korean drama. It\\'s not. (Of course, neither is Sweet Home.) It\\'s a drama/thriller made in Korea for Americans. Korean dramas are a completely different genre.It starts with the same premise we\\'ve read a billion times. The 13 tzametti, Truth or dare, question of \"how far would you go for money?\" Likewise answered with the basic premise inspired by The Most Dangerous Game.From this non original start... it actually devolves. It devolves into a shallow Battle Royale, with false (and woefully unoriginal) social commentary delivered with a lack of subtlety that would make Andrew Ridker jealous. Then ends with a disappointing attempt at an altruism message. We saw, I swear, more depth in the Hunger Games series. Take that as you will.I know, seeing the success of the MCU, that people like their literary themes shoved in their faces these days, rather than delivered in a real story, and on that account, I can say Squid Game did superb work.I rarely ask for true originality, because I know there is nothing new under the sun, but if you make me a PB&J, and make a spectacle out of it, like you invented it, I hate you.If you want good Korean television with real (albeit, at times, also not so subtle) social commentary, just wait for season 2 of Sweet Home with me.Last notes: Acting is distractingly inconsistent, the characters aren\\'t real people (I mean, the caricatures,) and the \"twist\" may be effective if you\\'ve never read a book or seen a movie.',\n",

One of the best shows of the year for sure, there is so much to pick apart of why I love this show. From a show that dives into narratives like classism, and society . How far will you to get out of a horrible place, what are you willing to sacrifice, and int he end will it really be worth it. Squid Game asks these questions through some great characters, some great visual imagery and a unnerving sound and audio you make you feel uneasy and of course great storytelling to get to that point.The idea about a battle royale format is nothing new, but it takes something like Squid Game to make it something special.Over time the series really makes you get into all the characters and their backstory and why they have come to this point. So when something happens to them you feel it emotionally. And the characters are complex, they are not one note, they all feel like they need to be there and you get why. And a show doing that in this type of format is rarely done well these days. The key to this show is its characters, and the actors that portray them put in all the effort to make it work, I wasnt disappointed by anyone.Only complaint I really have is the ending, I wasnt a massive fan of the reveal but it didn't take away too much. The journey to this point had been amazing so I was still left satisfied regardless.I rarely dabble in Korean cinema but every time I have I get a surprise like this.

There were some reveals, but they didn\\'t make much sense given what had already happened. They couldn\\'t really have been foreseen. There wasn\\'t enough information provided beforehand. It\\'s just \"you heard of this guy, right? Well, this guy is also this guy for some reason.\" Not juicy. Not juicy at all. It\\'s like they answered the setup with another setup.

There are some loose ends I\\'m glad were left loose.MINOR SPOILER IF GOING IN BLINDI also wish that the Netflix thumbnail/cover thing wouldn\\'t reveal so much about violence of the game. Before anyone started getting killed, I knew people were going to get killed, so it wasn\\'t as shocking as it was supposed to be.

There are a dime-a-dozen of these shows in the anime / Japanese world and Squid Game is the best one in a long while. What\\'s usually wrong with these shows is that they have a super natural element (gods, aliens) to them or outrageous reasoning as to how or why these games are evening taking place. That and the general writing is kind of ... well ... awful ... since these shows are usually about mass killing and the sick ways contestants have to be punished rather than concentrating on the actual characters.It\\'s the well written character dialogues and backgrounds that keep you hooked, not the senseless violence on screen. Squid Game understands this. The best episodes are the ones with no direct violence to them. They will crush you.In other shows \"aliens\" or what seems to be literally a handful of people are running the whole thing. That\\'s not good enough for me. Squid Game keeps it simple. Humans (a lot of them actually) run the show, and humans kill each other. I really appreciate the logistical side of the show, it keeps it grounded.As for the negatives, there is a small subplot involving a doctor that\\'s really not that relevant to the show. Later in the season there\\'s a group of people that you\\'ll encounter and they are horribly acted. You\\'ll notice it immediately when you get to it.

The plot is super predictable and sometimes completely lacks logic (like with the policeman). If you think this is original watch \"Oldboy\" or \"Battle Royale\", \"Saw\" or \"Hunger games\" for pointless violence. These movies were made 20 years ago and, even though they are not good imo, they are far better than Squid game.4. The whole game is pointless and hard to understand.

Rich people paying to see killings to pass the time.. and the need for people to help one another.The problem :\\r\\nbeing what it preaches against.Showing killings in such great detail and magnitude as a TV Series, moves this from being educational to actually profitting off of what it (in premise) is speaking out against.There is a difference between a film making a point with a graphic moment, versus a TV series using that same point over, and over, spending most episodes embellishing slow, atrocious, selfish deaths -- making money off of what it is saying is wrong with the world.If it\\'s so wrong, why are you showing it in such repetitive, graphic detail and making money off of it for the run of your series?This writer/ director has a wonderfully adept hand at directing, cinematography and storytelling as shown in the real world moments of this TV series.

Why would a English knower will be bothered about minor translation loss or miscommunication. We are watching it more then actually reading subtitles line by line. Many Korean who knows English well enough have to say this about subtitles. How will it affect? By getting better appreciation?

If you get a thrill of seeing people dye on screen for no reason, all decorated in ridiculous settings and surrounded with PlayStation-like mask people, go for it though.

There's so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.The first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that's known as debt. It uses the the Korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. This makes watching the series so much more relatable.Another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. The depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a Hollywood film. I personally felt the pain for the father.The fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. Ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. Nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.Overall, I feel this series is deep and thought provoking. It blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. Though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. So, spare a thought for someone around you who's in financial needs and offer them some help. I think that's the message from the filmmakers.\",\n",

If there\\'s something good about this it is the cinematography. Some scenes were well shot and granted the feeling of some of it being real.

I feel like everyone can come up with it and it reminds me of a lot of other films I've already seen.The worst thing about it, is that it's too predictable. I could already tell who would die and who would win after watching the first episode. That made it not exciting of course, because I was never scared for people to die.

It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people.\",\n",

Once you get the concept early on, it is clear where everything is headed, but not in a way that ruins anything.There are characters you really like and some you really hate. I was good with this throughout until the last episode or two. That's when both engines seem to lose power and the yellow masks drop down.I don't know if they are trying to make room for a season two, but what sent this into a spiral was that some characters are so stupid they don't even realize how stupid they are, even when someone tells them very clearly that they are stupid. On top of stupidity, there is this self-righteousness that is unbearable. It is amazing how oblivious people can be to their own hypocrisy.So, in summary, fun to watch but you just need a shower when it is over.

       " 'First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It\\'s been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That\\'s where they hit their stride.This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn\\'t offended by it, I just felt it didn\\'t serve the story or stay authentic.I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don\\'t actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he\\'s behind it. That\\'s a fine \"twist\", but my God, his \"explanation\" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn\\'t killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It\\'s the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn\\'t as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn\\'t feeling that.And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you\\'re a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn\\'t that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I\\'m going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to \"escape\" on. I guess that\\'s another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the \"rules\" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn\\'t a huge fan of that.All in all, it was good, but could have been great.',\n",

Also, the pace is really slow. And A LOT of things were very predictable. Sometimes I was just plain bored, and that isn't a good thing if it's a thriller/suspense genre series, right?Overall there were somewhat interesting characters and a few good moments about bonds, but still, there was something lacking. I wasn't shocked or on the verge of tears when someone died or when a emotional scene happened. Also, the main character was unlikable. He showed a great ethic belief during the games, but then he didn't show much growth (after the games he's still a good for nothing loser).Alice in Borderland on the other hand, has more fantasy elements, but a fast pace combined with unusual turns of events that makes you really sit on the edge of your seat.Last, but not least: please watch it in the original audio (Korean) with subtitles. DON'T watch it dubbed. Don't be lazy cuz you'll have to read subtitles, because firstly, it's not a big deal, and secondly, you'll miss so much emotion, humor and whatnot if you watch dubbed versions (of anything, really).

       "['Squid Game is average show. Average actors, average characters etc. Only reasons why im not voting for 4 is that there are some well made plots and its an original show. Squid game did great in creating specific games, music and characters relationships. Now the negatives. Squid Game did terribly in doing the layout of story. There are many unrealistic moments just to keep the important characters alive. Story can be chaotic and you can get easily lost. Ending of 1st season is terrible and unrealistic. You will just look at it and wonder how could someone come up with this nonsense. Squid Game is little bit overhyped show. Its not bad and I really enjoyed many parts but that storywriting, oh boy.',\n",

A group of people who have extreme debts are whisked away to an undisclosed location for a series of trials and competitions. If they win, they get big bucks, but losers are killed. I’ll confess that I fast forwarded thru some of the character dialogue scenes. They really weren’t that interesting, plus the perilous situations provide the fun and in later episodes the violence. This international phenomena is certainly unique, but more a curiosity for the weirdness than any kind of important drama. (Nine 45-minute episodes in Korean with subtitles or dubbed in English)',\n",

       " 'Squid Game is of the Puzzle-Adventure-Mystery-Survival-Drama genre. This is a plot type that has been used many times and recently in Asian films.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line: I\\'ll watch season 2 if it is developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acting ranges from good to not-good. The writing is good accept the basic premise of the plot seems somewhat contrived and not believable. The \"games\" may feel silly and not believable. The VIP characters seemed badly developed with poor acting - in my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirecting, editing and other technicals are of professional quality. Casting seemed mostly appropriate. Squid Game is a film series that you don\\'t appreciate until the last episode. If you only watch the first view episodes you will not be able to appreciate what it has to offer. Take that into consideration as many film reviewers only watch the beginning of films.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the English language audio dubs were not good. I do not speak Korean - but, after the second episode I used the original Korean audio track (with English subtitles) and found the acting much more enjoyable. If you are American and if you are not familiar with Korean, you may find the long-vowel sounds that Koreans use for emphasis to be annoying - but, there is less of that in the later episodes and your ear will attenuate after a few episodes. The social commentary was relevant - in my opinion. Many years ago I listened to a radio talk show involving personal debt crisis. People\\'s lives had been destroyed by credit card debt, student loan debt, spending too much on their car and spending too much on their home, etc. The host of the radio program would help people put together a plan to drastically reduce their spending (often by selling their \"luxury car\" and sometimes by selling their home) and pay off their debts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a lot of over the top, over-speculation in the symbolism within this film. The director has been clear that symbolism (involving the colors of red and blue, for example) were not his intent.',\n",
       " 'One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is \"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children\\'s games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake\". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother\\'s card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the same can\\'t be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don\\'t feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game. Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.',\n",

Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery.

As someone who is a big fan of solid Korean cinema (Parasite, Mother, Old Boy, Memories of Murder), I was intrigued by a TV series that had generated so much buzz and promised to be violent and dark. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, I was disappointed because the plot was nothing new. We've seen the same basic premise in dozens of other movies and TV shows that have come before it. Second, with the exceptions of Lee Jung-Jae and Park Hae-Soo. But even their decent performances couldn't save a show in which the majority of the acting is something that belongs either in a daytime soap opera, the characters are one-dimensional caricatures, and the dialogue is overwhelmingly cliche. In fact, the acting is so over the top and melodramatic that I repeatedly found myself laughing at moments that were meant to be tragic, depressing, or shocking. The trophy for bad-acting, however, should go to the foreigners who were hired as English-speaking actors to play the roles of VIP clients. I've seen better acting in elementary school plays, and that is not hyperbole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, if you're into cheap plot twists, and you know that you enjoy other Korean dramas that ooze melodrama and hackneyed tropes, then this might be up your alley.

If you don't like the sight of blood, steer clear because there is a LOT of blood/murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe games largely put players in the position of having to make morality choices -- this is clearly what the show wants you to think about. While I appreciate the effort, there just isn't enough nuance in the characters and the choices they're forced to make to elevate this above a run-of-the-mill morality tale, and the rivers of blood drag the effort down. I did find a couple of moments genuinely moving, but only a couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, SG does a good job of piquing the viewer's curiosity regarding what the heck the whole twisted exercise is for. However, the resolution of season 1 rings hollow; the scene with the reveal feels very contrived. The explanation for the whole sociopathic, bat-**** crazy endeavor doesn't make much sense unless you accept that all the parties involved are, well... bat-**** crazy sociopaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're merely looking to satisfy whatever torture porn craving you may have, this will likely satisfy. If you want believable story with nuanced, thought-provoking dilemmas, this is passable, but not a must-see.\",\n",

They could have stopped it at a perfect time(mother scene) but for some reason they decided to roll for another 20 minutes or so showing us a very unsatisfying and quiet stupid plot twist that actually ruins a lot of parts from the previous episodes.

Beside the first major plot twist, the rest of the twists are thrown at you all at once in the final episode. This isn't to say there aren't other twists of course, just not those crucial to the main plot.

I like how it incorporates today's pandemic scenario and protocol into this show. It makes a lot of sense and after all it's about virus. The show also has a main villain, the boss, that is unusual and unique. Each episode is a story gripping. Characters are well developed and each of them are unique individuals. Their interactions are very interesting to watch especially when they are all kept getting stuck in a confined space and trying to figure out how to escape. Consequently that is when their deep personalities reveal. There are many other supporting characters that are uniquely told and developed. This show is like mix bags of Escape Room, World War Z, Resident Evil and one other popular movie (don't want to spoil). Surprisingly this show is actually based on a Webtoon, Korean online graphic novel. That's how good this is for it to be converted into live action. It has high potential for season 2 like Squid Game but somehow it has better and thorough ending (can be stand alone without season 2) and it doesn't leave you hanging like Squid Game.

No episode felt like filler, and with 12 episodes there\\'s a lot of time to flesh out characters and the plot nicely. My favourite characters are Dae-su, Su-hyeok, Mijin and Jae-Ik. Dae-su and Mijin are priceless. Certain characters have such relatable personalities. Don\\'t think anyone was \\'annoying\\' at all. Music is okay-good but the sound effects are *chef\\'s kiss*.

Les personnages sont bien caractérisés et leur parcours permet de mettre en lumière les graves problèmes du harcèlement scolaire et la dureté de l’enseignement si l’on veut espérer intégrer une université…\\r\\n\\r\\nMais nos lycéens ont rapidement d’autres chats à fouetter, notamment des hordes de zombis à dérouiller… et parfois à tuer, car le zombi coréen est beaucoup plus brutal, retors et difficile à tuer que le zombi américain. Cela étant, la série reprend à son compte tous les clichés du genre : la survie impitoyable, les gentils et les salopards, les traîtres et les lâches… et tutti quanti.\\r\\n\\r\\nMais le rythme reste toujours très élevé sur les 12 épisodes d’une heure chacun en moyenne et on reste happé d’un bout à l’autre, du début à la fin.

       " 'I\\'m a sucker for these zombie movies and shows. They always manage to pull me into watching it. Korea somehow manages to make zombies more interesting compared to western movies and shows. For example, Train to Busan was absolutely stellar. My hope was that this show was on the level of that movie. So does Korea deliver another excellent zombie action or is it a big miss?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s get the obvious out of the way first, the zombie action is indeed exciting to watch. There are some exciting and creative sequences in this show such as the dining hall sequence which is filmed like one shot. There are some other creative sequences such as one involving a fight between two individuals on top of bookcases while zombies are underneath. Another is where the characters build a giant wall to hold off zombies while they escape the other way. Another is where they create a circular wall while getting from point A to B. All these sequences feel very original and I certainly enjoyed watching them. I also have to give a lot of praise to the makeup artist as the zombies look frighteningly good. The zombie actors also do a good job as well in making them feel inhuman and unnatural. The zombies here are definitely quite scary and that is quite a feat considering how oversaturated zombies are in media.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actors all do a phenomenal job in their portrayal. They all manage to give their characters distinct personalities even if they are just minor characters. The actors who die and become zombies also do a great job as zombies. The story is also quite engaging despite just being mostly about surviving. The story focuses on the dynamic and relationship of the surviving school students. We see them work together but also argue and fight but it never feels over the top or anything. What the story does the best is in delivering on the emotions and there is definitely some emotional stuff. We also got a more interesting origin for the virus that is also quite sympathetic and we got some special zombies that give the situation more spice to it. They also spend a fair amount of time with the military in the series to give the audience an understanding of their response to the virus. There is also quite a bit of romance in this and it surprisingly works well despite the situation not being the exact best for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a lot of characters in this show and honestly maybe too many. The show doesn\\'t just focus on one group of survivors and instead multiple groups which lead to a lot of characters to pay attention to. What can be annoying is that a fair amount of these characters have nothing interesting to them but the series still spends a fair amount of time on them. If a character doesn\\'t have an interesting backstory or personality then they are probably going to die which results in predictable deaths. There are also some characters that are just in the series for no reason such as a streamer that I felt added nothing to the plot apart from taking screen time away from actual interesting characters. Additionally, there are so many moments in this series where a character makes a really stupid decision that is frustrating to watch. Also, the characters not going for the head is a big annoyance. It also gets annoying when some characters stand around instead of helping their friend who is being attacked. The series is also a bit too long and can feel a bit exhausting to watch. It is 12 episodes but after watching, it definitely felt like the series could at least be cut down by 2 episodes. There is a lot of sequences where it does just feel like they are padding for time. For example, we will have scenes where we watch characters stand around or just building and not talking or a scene where they share chocolate and it all feels too long and pointless. There is a \"villain\" in the show and that person is WAY too overused and gets defeated in the same way like 4 times, to the point that it is kind of laughable. There are also some potentially interesting plot lines that they could\\'ve explored but it is never utilized or explored. There are also some characters that just die for shock value which sucks as it feels like the show would be more interesting if they were kept alive. Overall, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling and exciting zombie show that unfortunately stumbles on all the subplots created. I did come out a little disappointed that they didn\\'t utilize everything the show introduced effectively but it was still a really good time. It does end with a potential tease for season 2 and it might resolve some of the remaining plot threads from season 1. The ending is also quite interesting and it does make me wonder what direction they could go in. Thus I am hopeful for a season 2 despite the show\\'s shortcomings.',\n",
       " 'Some of the contrivances in this are just insane. Your suspension of disbelief must be at an all-time high to excuse some of the characters ridiculous/poor decisions.

How is he... what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if you can ignore all the times you\\'ll feel this way, WHICH WILL BE A LOT, it\\'s an okay zombie show. Initially I was worried about teen angst, I don\\'t like teen drama, its usually boring and revolves around people not saying things that could easily solve 90% of any and all problems. Luckily the show splits its focus from time to time, and we get to see different groups of people dealing with very different situations. It\\'s a good break from the Teen angle and lets us see glimpses of how the world is reacting to this situation. I think if this were written a bit better, with less contrivances, and characters I actually cared about, I could\\'ve given it a higher score.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think if people are overly positive about this it\\'s the whole K-pop vibe people are on... Essentially, anything Korean gets a pass due to pop culture favouritism. Whereas, if people are overly negative, it\\'s potentially due to the cliched teen drama, contrivance filled writing and dumb character decisions that they can\\'t overlook for the sake of entertainment. Look, it\\'s no Kingdom. It\\'s no Train to Busan (THE 1ST ONE OMG that second movie was baaaad). But it\\'s an okay watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, one last thing... Too many episodes.',\n",

It has interesting cases but I found it a depressing watch as there was no levity in any of the episodes just poor parents, abused children and horrible events. An interesting series with a strong central character but very little development on the histories of the rest of the cast and lots of information about the workings of the juvenile justice system.,It is such laziness that raises the counter argument. One must not let it be, let your guard down, let it slide. Because justice is not only about fairness to the offender, especially the young, but more importantly fairness to the victim.This is a heavy drama. No relief at all. If you don\\'t like that skip it. All cases are supposedly based on real cases. There are some moments of lingering sentimentality. But those can be forgiven for completing the arch of emotions.Recall there were 5 cases, one sidetracked involving a half way house of sorts. Beside the concluding case, I find the school cheating scandal most interesting. Because the show explained how the rich kid cheaters can benefit (and hurt others) even more by dropping out of school. The law have it\\'s limits. This cases also lead to the main backstory and also onto other brutal and organized crimes by the same defenders.Obviously the underage murder is also shocking as to how they thought about deceiving the system.The main lead is tremendously restraint. I especially like how slow, weighted and the preciseness (seemingly as I don\\'t know Korean) of her enounciations. From the get go you know there must be a back story to \\'I detest juvenile offenders\\'Two points taken off for the over righteous concluding speech during the discipline hearing. And heavy focus on the main character. But still excellent.,Ignore the paid-for, planted raves in the reviews here. Watch it for yourself. This is a big step down from other South Korean shows that have graced Netflix lately. It\\'s pure lowest common denominator TV fare with outsized characters, silly situations and bad acting.,I found this series to be very touching, bringing lots of emotions to the fore. It has an important social message concerning the delicacies of raising children in the correct manner. Superb acting with excellent scripts and filmography. All in all it is a very intelligent series well worth watching.,This is a serious drama that seeks to look carefully at the good and bad of juvenile justice in Korea. As usual for Korean drama that is achieved via a highly engaging story line that entertains as well as informs.Just occasionally the travails of Judge Sim, the key protagonist, lurch beyond credibility. But the propulsive plot and powerful acting keep you glued and almost succeed in cloaking these moments.Overall a highly rewarding watch that I recommend to everyone who has yet to discover the great strengths of Korean dramas.,Brief and unique is all I can say, it all based on real life crime. As a real life crime obsessed I approve that this really is happening to kids that lack of attention from parents/guardian but not all because in some case they\\'re just psycho. I love how director just give 10 episode instead of 16 that make this even more interesting. Good job on this such a fresh ideas on k-drama content!,Good, but i think it\\'s overrated. I would rate it 6/10. I thought it would be better especially after viewing the rating and reading reviews. Good story. Medium acting. Good background music. Season 1 contains 10 episodes.,I stumbled upon this series while scrolling through Netflix, looked into the first episode and it hit me like a truck. Juvenile Justice really came out of left field for me, and in retrospect I\\'m really thankful for the experience.The story revolves around Shim Eun Seok (Kim Hye-su), a juvenile court judge who appears stone cold and lays down the law with an iron fist on young offenders, while also battling her own demons of the past deep inside. The juvenile justice system is highly divisive, conflicting and heavily overloaded, laying not only the sentencing and punishment of juvenile offenders on the court but even the aftercare and oversight on the judges themselves. While the law treats them as children who are scarcely accountable for their own actions, often it doesn\\'t defend victims or take their circumstances into account, what lead them down this path. Domestic violence, neglect, mistreatment, bullying, often very hard to properly prosecute. On the other hand, many young criminals straight up expect to get off with nothing but probation and a slap on the wrist while committing very real crimes, theft, robbery, blackmail, prostitution, grievous violence and even murder, fully aware of their actions. Judge Shim sails the muddy waters of this tattered legal embroglio to try and truly punish young criminals and bring absolution to the victims of the system.Honestly, I was truly surprised by this series! I half expected a confusing and boring TV schlock, filled with incessant jargon and theatrical melodrama. But what I got was a very intense, high quality, easily digestible (for a legal series), very binge-worthy story and some of the best acting I\\'ve seen in a while! Kim Hye-su completely dominates the role of Judge Shim. Coming off as a stone cold, no-nonsense inquisitor who absolutely throws the book at young criminals trying to slip through the cracks, while she slowly learns that the juvenile court is not only there to punish but also to teach, reform and protect those fallen by the wayside and wronged by the system.The production quality is excellent! The camera work, direction and even the few special effects are way higher quality than one would expect from a TV series of this kind. This far excuses some of the plotholes and the sometimes wooden acting by some of the support cast. I usually don\\'t like kids in series and movies, but I have to say, the young cast brings their A-game and believable acting throughout the series, which was really refreshing. The story goes at breakneck speeds, filled with lots of detail, action, intrigue, investigations and hard choices which makes the series feel a lot longer than 10 episodes. There\\'s never a dull moment watching Judge Shim and co going above and beyond their line of duty to get to the truth and render a truly just verdict in the end.All in all, I highly recommend Juvenile Justice to anyone looking for an intense court drama with a flair for complexity and some action on the side!,I don\\'t personally understand all the 10 star reviews, but maybe they understand Korean drama better than me. I really like the premise and the main character, Judge Sim, is intense in a unique way (but almost too much so). The actors, when not screaming or crying, are really engaging. But I\\'m not a fan of the yelling and over-the-top wailing that permeates each episode. Nor do I enjoy watching young girls constantly getting their hair pulled while being slapped/kicked around- it\\'s almost torture porn-ish. Other than that, interesting storylines, good writing, good production value, and insight into Korean culture are a plus. I also appreciate the messaging that parents need to step up and take care of their children.,ANOTHER UPDATE: I want to make sure someone unfamiliar with Korea is not deceived by this show or some of the information on this board. It seems I also have to define what \"dramatized\" means. The Korean legal system has a special set of laws for kids under 14. That is the main issue the show is trying to tackle. Some of the crimes depicted in the show did happen. However, the show has purposely lowered the age of the criminals to make it more shocking and fit the narrative of \"under the age of 14.\" Lastly, \"NO,\" judges in Korea do not go chasing after suspects. When you take an actual event and embellish it with outrageous details, that\\'s dramatization.UPDATED REVIEW: I\\'ve managed to watch a few more episodes. Unfortunately, I am lowering my rating from an 8 to a 6. While the subject matter is interesting and the acting remains strong, the show fails to deliver on many ends.The drama attempts to tackle a very serious issue that has been at the center of controversy in Korea for a while. The show is stacked with a solid lineup of veteran actors who have demonstrated their acting skills in dozens of works and I have no doubt that they will not disappoint here. Having viewed the first couple of episodes, I do find that the story is somewhat over dramatized. Perhaps the show runners felt that taking a more realistic approach may lessen the entertainment value. I think a more subtle approach may have been more effective in bringing the issue to the forefront of discussion.,This series provides a freshness from the court or law series because it provides a new perspective on child crime. Unfortunately, the main character of the judge is too investigative and crossed the line that should be the domain of the police.,This series has become one of my favorites, without any effort. I have always appreciated the detective, detective and investigative series, but above all series that take place in court. This series amazed me, the best I\\'ve seen.The protagonist, Judge Shim (played by Kim Hye-soo) is simply perfect, she has a very interesting approach to dealing with \"young criminals\" and gives them the right lesson to grow at their best. The backstories of the various characters are treated very well and manage to make you empathize with each of them, from the protagonists to the tertiary characters.I highly recommend this series, it is very interesting and is perfect for a marathon.,\"The law can\\'t protect all victims.\" The bitter truth, no matter how much I think unfair it is, but it happens in our reality and this series just depicts the tip of the iceberg on how truly intricate the law is. From the officials to everyone involved in that. Juvenile justice is just so brilliant series that unlike any other legal series, it has that depth of their characters and also talks about young offenders in a way that not only entertain us but also give us some understanding how vulnerable children are that our actions, whether it\\'s good or bad, would affect them greatly.,Surprisingly good! For me it was a roller coaster of emotions and even had me shed some tears in some episodes. All the cast did wonderful job acting 👏 👏👏.I saw other comments that said \"bad acting\" and \"medium acting\" and I\\'m asking myself, are they tone-death or did they watch the same show OR did they watch it with English dubbing? Never watch anything with dubbing unless you\\'re doing two things at once. It\\'s never the same!,Really fun for the first 2 episodes, after that the level of fun gradually decreases. A series that plays a big story, but when told, there is only water. There is no sharpness of the hot topic of the story left at the end.,The best thing about this drama is that they are not \"overly-dramatizing\" the crimes as many are suggesting.On the contrary, these crimes are based on real life incidents that shook Korean society to the core. I still remember about the case where a teenage girl chopped up a young kid and then laughed in the court. This was a real case that happened in South Korea.As this is cinema, it\\'s certainly dramatized but almost all cases are real including the one with throwing up the brick.Kim Hye-soo is at her absolute best.,It\\'s very dramatic and emotional series but I like it. The acting is good and it has solid story line. Not boring at all. I\\'m happy that Netflix Korea has brought another good Korean series.,Damn what a strong (first) season of a show.Let me start by praising the acting within this series. Everybody does such an amazing job, from the court helpers to the victims. Sometimes you\\'ll forget you\\'re watching actors, and the drama hits even harder because of it. Whoever did the casting for \\'Juvenile Justice\\' should get a raise.Considering the subject matter is juvenile criminality, and this series does not hold back the punches at all, prepare to get a bit depressed at times. There aren\\'t always happy endings. Or as the main actress so eloquently put it: \"The law doesn\\'t protect every single victim\". The main characters do their best to put things right though.That everything isn\\'t tied with a bow at the end of every episode makes it more realistic though. Even when they get the bad guys, as one of the court helpers rightly reminds us, the victim is still scarred for life because of what happened. This is not a happy show.It\\'s thrilling though, and emotional, and shocking. It makes you angry, sad and hopefull. It\\'s *beeping* amazing television. This show is totally worth your free time.,This show touch all part of case the criminal, the victim, the families. You will see each side of emotions its not just court room darma its journal of emotions. In last episode in few last mints my heart exploded.. the pain of a mother. Kim did a fantastic job ..love her.,The series is fast moving although it is only 10 episodes in total. All the casts are excellent in their portrayal of the characters - including the perpetrators and victims. I am impressed with Judge Sim for standing her grounds on her believes in the way the juveniles should be treated to correct their behaviours for the future.,I heard Korean dramas are very popular all over south east Asia and especially in China. I\\'m starting to see why, as all k-dramas I have watched were great (move to heaven, squid game, my name).The characters are shown very well and I could relate quickly. The cases made me think about law and justice. The pace is just right, the story thrilling and touching.Sometimes I\\'m not sure whether something is Korean culture or individual character e.g. Bosses seem to yell a lot, and there is a strong hierarchy of respect between people, whereas in western culture everyone is more equal, irrespective of age and position (at least compared to as it\\'s shown in juvenile justice). One case is about the education system where I also think some background info would be helpful to research upfront.This left me a tiny bit confused at times.9/10PS: im not criticizing the show for showing Korean culture, just stating it may make some situations seem weird for westerners.,Kim Hye Su delivers her lines with so much conviction and mental prowess her persona alone influences those around her that are morally feeble and need proper cultivation but also rectifies on behalf of those quiet unheard defeated voices at large.,When people talk about a show being over dramatized as they call it, they forget that this is not a documentary. This is show business therefore it is supposed to deliver some sort of entertainment. You complaining about the drama shows that they have done a good job. It\\'s not a true crime docu-series. While some aspects of the show could be based on real events (which I don\\'t know and don\\'t seem to care) the fact still stands that this is not supposed to be a real life depiction of anything.Now let\\'s get down to the review:This show is a great catch. It is raw and VERY realistic. For example if you\\'ve watched Devil Judge you know how the main judge Kang was? Vigilante. Basically green arrow without the arrows. This show didn\\'t have any of that nonsense. No rich judge background. No hidden agenda. She didn\\'t go on a wild chase after the kids who murdered her child. She just did her job. She made sure every sentence was just and victims felt the \"justice\"\\r\\nIt was great, the way they walked through the emotions of every character and I can see the show having more than one season because the characters have character.One thing I wish they would have done was give their characters a better backstory and a better ending.So what happened to Kang ? He resigned and then what? He was in so many episodes for them to just eliminate him and give him a cameo in the last episode.The other judge from Busan was great (sorry forgot his name) he had a good backstory BUT what was his ending? When you almost make certain characters the main characters (by giving them so much screen time) they should have a climax. All he said was that he was disappointed but he understood. Then what? What is his ending? If you dont pay close attention you will not find out why he even went to Juvey when he was young.Anyway, these are minor things. A plot can\\'t always be 100% complete. We always miss out certain things as scriptwriters but the script is strong enough to survive the little things.,Parents are the GURU not just a teacher for a child. In Bengali parenting is called \\' manus kora\\' which means making of a human being. This series shows us the effect of neglecting the children and also the effect of too much care. This also shows how bad judgment can bring more crimes.Overall this series gives a very good social message.,First time I wrote a review because how good this drama really is. The lead actress acting is really great. Also my first time finishing a K-Drama series. I watched a lot of K-Drama but never actually finish it off because usually they are expected and somewhat slow pacing so I got bored easily. But this series really got me hooked bad. Finished it in a week. Not sure about the popularity of the actor and actresses but I don\\'t they are that popular? Compare to other drama series that at least have one popular lead. Anyway, definitely must watch!,This Netflix original series is the saddest and one of the best show i have ever seen. Juvenile Justice is so well-written and it deserves more recognition! It depicts so many social issues about young offenders, mirroring someone\\'s reality in a heartbreaking way. The plot, characters, acting, and every aspects are just remarkable.,Well, it is a shame but it was a real case in Korea few years ago that two juveniles have butchered a little kid. Also it is a serious issue in Korea that the laws and punishments are very weak including juvenile justice. All the episodes were based on real cases in Korea that were major juvenile issues in recent few years. This drama has shown serious issues in Korea and dealt some cases to help people realize that juvenile crimes are not minor crimes anymore but they have become serious crimes. I really wanna say that the actors have done great jobs.And before you judge \"Asian\" dramas for different cultures that you don\\'t understand, I really recommend you to look up their cultures before, after or while you watch them because that\\'s what most Asian people would do when they watch \"Non-Asian\" dramas.,Nothing to say, just watch it :)All episodes are based on true crimes.It is just by far my favorite law related Korean TV-series.It is just epic. I finished all episodes in one day.,10 episodes is just not long enough.Watched the whole series in one day.The acting and the raw emotions it brought out is superb.Just watch it.you will be hooked as well.,The main actress has a stunning interpretation on this kdrama! She is fierce on her acting as she does on other kdramas as Signal and Hyena! This one caught me and saw all 10episodes in 2 days, each episode captures your attention and many cases were inspired in true crimes commited in Korea. Totally worth watching.,I don\\'t understand why people here complain about a drama being a drama.I mean, the series are created to warn us what happens if we, adults, fail in parenting juvenile. The director perhaps has his/her intention in doing so. The important this is what comes in your mind after watching this. The great series always leave spaces for its audience to think.Each character has their own storyline and this is very well-delivered by actors. All actors have magnificent skills in delivering lines that could be cringe in a clear and effective way. There is no right or wrong answers in reality, so as the characters\\' belief. It is all about discussing and finding the best answer of what WE could do for a juvenile. By caring and paying attention on social issues or by funding childcare centres? This is the message that the series demonstrate and, I think it is our responsibility to make an action.\"It takes a village to raise a child.\"\\r\\nI would say, this is the best series that could ever describe the true meaning of this phrase.,Juvenile Justice will have you on the edge of your seat on every episode because of the many unexpected turns. I hope that there will be more seasons because there are plenty of shocking stories to tell.,Presented the roots of the problems our juveniles face today. The consequences of the parents not being involved in their lives. The need for more community support and resources for parents and families. The legal system is overwhelmed and backlogged with juvenile cases. Corruption in the government. What money can buy. These are true circumstances for modern day society.I though there was just too much profanity in the English translation. Personally, I don\\'t think it represents the Korean people. I\\'m sure they have profanity, not the one the western world has, nor the way it was used in this series. I hope they tone it down if they plan to make further episodes., Is justice always served ?\\r\\n, Thats just the way the law is\\r\\n, Decent but predictable TV series not up to usual Korean shows.\\r\\n, Wow! Every episode brings a surprise\\r\\n, Another Korean triumph\\r\\n, Wow just wow!\\r\\n, Not bad\\r\\n, \"I despise young offenders!\"\\r\\n, Heavy\\r\\n, Perhaps too over dramatized\\r\\n, Gives a new perspective but it\\'s too dramatic.\\r\\n, Children need attention\\r\\n, a great series with more depth into it\\r\\n, Another Korean hit!\\r\\n, Really fun for the first 2 episodes....\\r\\n, One of the best kdramas I\\'ve ever watched.\\r\\n, Very dramatic but I like it.\\r\\n, Unlawfully good\\r\\n, Very well written show.\\r\\n, Judges should always have an unbiased and empathetic attitude to both\\r\\n, Great series\\r\\n, Kim Hye Su\\'s amazing delivery\\r\\n, It\\'s a Movie Series NOT a documentary\\r\\n, A good series with good social message\\r\\n, Unexpected story\\r\\n, I hope more people will watch this series\\r\\n, Amazing, well-made\\r\\n, Just watch it\\r\\n, Hooked\\r\\n, Best suspense kdrama!!\\r\\n, \"It takes a village to raise a child.\"\\r\\n, Excellent Find\\r\\n, Korean Law & Order\\r\\n,Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably don\\'t need me to give you this warning. \"Squid Game\" is one of the most incredibly violent things you can watch and it\\'s NOT something you want to let your kids see. And, if your mother or Father O\\'Reilly drop by, you also might want to think twice before watching this South Korean mini-series with them! You\\'ll see hundreds dies, heads explode and tons of blood....just don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you!In many ways, the show is a lot like the Japanese movie \"Battle Royale\" or the \"Hunger Games\" films...but with one huge exception. Unless the unwilling participants in the other films, the folks in \"Squid Game\" know what they\\'re in for after the first round...and their deaths were because of their greed or situation in life.The film begins by showing you a bit of Seong Gi-hun\\'s life. He (Lee Jung-jae) is a loser in pretty much every way and his gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage. He\\'s deeply in debt to loan sharks who vow to kill him and you have a very hard time feeling sorry for the guy. He\\'s ruined his, his wife\\'s and his daughter\\'s lives.When one of his loan sharks catches up to him, you assume they\\'ll either beat Seong or kill him. Oddly, however, instead they have him sign a paper in blood....and in order to avoid being killed he signs it without hesitation. What he doesn\\'t realize is that by doing this, he\\'s agreed to enter one of the strangest gambling contests ever...if not the strangest.Seong arrives at the location the paper tells him to go to...but why, he isn\\'t sure. Soon a van pulls up and he enters...and is knocked out almost immediately. When he awakens, he\\'s with 455 other participants...who, at this point, have no idea what they\\'re in for with these strangely clad \\'hosts\\'. They are told they\\'re playing a game of Red Light/Green Light...and most of the folks think it\\'s all very childish. However, when the first one moves when it\\'s a red light, snipers kill him!!! Soon, they realize that they\\'d BETTER make it to the goal line before the allotted time or they\\'ll die...and die many of them do.After this \\'game\\', about 200 of them were killed. But here\\'s where it gets interesting. They are then allowed to vote as to whether to finish the game and go home or continue. By only one vote, they vote to go home. Episode two shows them at home...and it\\'s my favorite one of the shows in the series. At this point, most of the remaining players actually decide to return to the game, as many of them face death or prison if they quit the game. The final seven episodes are the continuation of the game...as well as showing the actions of a cop who manages to infiltrate the contest.Again, just to make things clear, this is a mega-violent show....even more so than the \"Fargo\" television series! But I kept watching despite this because the writing was simply exquisite and the characters in the game truly memorable...and in some cases, infamous. It also is exceptional because so much of it is hard to predict! Overall, a film that is different enough from \"Hunger Games\" and \"Battle Royale\" that it really works well. I found it so compelling, I watched the entire series in one evening....though I\\'d only planned on seeing and episode or two.By the way, if you care, the amount won in the contest is a bit more than $38,000,000 US dollars.,Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that\\'s become a global smash hit on Netflix. It\\'s truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children\\'s games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I\\'ve seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.,Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you\\'ve probably heard quite a bit about that already.If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!,Mixed feelings on this one. The glorification of violence in shows like this tend to be desensitizing and seem to acclimate those with criminal tendencies to head down a wrong path. Yet the challenge of the individual games create a paradox of situations in which the viewer is steered toward thinking that certain players will work together, only to find they are pitted against each other, as in the marble game. The horror of that game was brought forth when a married couple naively decided to work together, only to be faced with the grim reality that there could only be one survivor. These kinds of situations were prevalent throughout the series episodes, making it almost impossible to know who would survive at the final outcome. Through it all, I believed there was something noteworthy about the old man, player #1 (Hideo Kimura), who\\'s physical resemblance to an aged Korean Billy Crystal impinged on my brain every time I saw him (go back and see what I mean). Oddly, for such a large cast of characters, there weren\\'t any that I could really connect with in a meaningful way. Perhaps the closest was player #240, young Ji-yeong (Vivian Lu, incorrectly identified in the credits as Sae-Byeok), eliminated in play when partnered with player #67 Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Hoyeon). Tied for most despicable characters were player #101 Deok-su (Paul Nakauchi) and player #212 Han Mi-neo (Stephanie Komure), so it was appropriate that they should be eliminated together in the Glass Stepping Stones game. The ending here seemed a little superfluous considering all that went before, with the old man Il-nam wagering a final personal bet against Gi-hun (Greg Chun), player #456, and winner of the grand prize of 45.6 billion won. Doing the conversion, that came to just under thirty nine million dollars, and seeing all those big numbers can really disorient the viewer. When Gi-hun paid the flower vendor at the end of the story a ten thousand won note for a single bunch, it seemed awful generous, until doing the math revealed it was about eight dollars and fifty cents.,Even if you\\'ve seen \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Money Heist\", \"Squid Game\" (called \"Ojing-eo Geim\" in the original Korean) is still going to shock you. The sad thing is that so many people have no other choice but to risk everything like the characters here.Definitely see it. You\\'ll never look at any children\\'s game the same way again after seeing it.,This runaway hit from South Korea is centred on Seong Gi-hun, a heavily indebted man who is invited to take part in a series of six games that if he wins will solve his problems. He accepts gets into a vehicle where a gas puts him to sleep. When he wakes he is in a large facility with over four hundred other people; they are watched over by masked armed guards. Here they are told the rules, one of which states that if a majority of players want to quit the game will end but they will not get any prize money. As they play the first game, the school yard game \\'red light green light\\' they quickly learn that being eliminated is quite literal with losers being shot on the spot! Over the course of the series Gi-hun gets to know various other contestants; some he befriends and forms a team with for certain games; others are quickly identified as a danger. As the games continue more and more people are eliminated. While this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.When I saw this recommended on Netflix I thought I\\'d watch it sometime but was in no great rush as I assumed to would be a Korean \\'Alice in Borderland\\'. After hearing talk of its popularity I thought perhaps I should watch it sooner. I\\'m glad that I did. I really liked \\'Alice in Borderland\\' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. The games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. The characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. The programme\\'s design is impressive; I especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. The cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. Overall I\\'d definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.,Everybody has been talking about \"Squid Game.\" I\\'ve been seeing memes and costumes, and I was in the dark. I didn\\'t feel compelled to watch it at all because I generally don\\'t watch T. V. shows. I found that any show can make one or two good episodes, but then I begin disliking every character after a while. I broke down and watched \"Squid Game\" at the constant urging of my wife and to me it\\'s meh.To me it\\'s a Korean \"Hunger Games.\" I know that there are some big differences, but it\\'s still people playing deadly games for a prize. What has drawn in so many viewers is the fact that adults are playing kids games with deadly consequences. Of course, there has to be some exposition and character development in a nine episode show with each ep being an hour, but what we\\'re all there to see is who will survive and who will be eliminated. Like those who go to NASCAR races for the crash.Maybe it\\'s a victim of its own hype, but I wasn\\'t that impressed. There were some impressive moments such as the first game they played and the pure shock of it all, and maybe even episode six when choosing partners put them in a position many of them didn\\'t want to be in, but I will say that some of the \\'umph\\' is taken out of a show when you know that anyone without a significant speaking role is definitely dying before any main character. I\\'ve labeled this spoiler so I\\'ll say this: when you have a tug-o-war game with just about every main character on one team it\\'s a dead giveaway that they\\'re going to win no matter how weak and frail they look.So, to \"Squid Game\" I say \"Meh.\" Only one character was halfway exciting or fun to watch and the side stories didn\\'t interest me enough. If \"Squid Game\" were four episodes instead of nine I think it would\\'ve been a lot better. That being said, I\\'m committed now. I would like to see what happens in season two.,Exciting show that keeps you watching. The Korean part is the emotional connection with the characters and their financial problems and how they have family obligations. The violence although comically exaggerated is unusual for a K drama. Good acting from LSJ and PHS veteran actors. Striking set design gives it a visually glossy look. Whatever makes international audiences watch K dramas is good. This isn\\'t a typical K drama and far from one of the best. But it\\'s a swift watch.,I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i\\'ve just seen too many movies, but i\\'ve seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you\\'re missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It\\'s superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There\\'s a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn\\'t see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can\\'t possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn\\'t mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can\\'t they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next.,STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSEASON ONESeong (Lee Jung-Jae) is down on his luck, addicted to gambling and in debt to vicious loan sharks, not to mention eager to reacquaint with his estranged son. At his lowest ebb, he finds himself approached by a man at a train station, who offers to take care of his financial woes if he agrees to participate in a secretive ritual. With no choice but to accept, Seong finds himself plunged, with a group of others, in to a nightmarish, garish battle for survival.Korean cinema has enjoyed some recent worldwide acclaim, with cult hits such as Parasite and The Platform leaving quite an impression. But this year it\\'s enjoyed this again in a TV format, with this mind-bending visceral blow from writer/director Hwang Dong-hyuk. It\\'s sheer outrageousness and visual astonishment is enough to leave an impression, and even sparked some copycat behaviour around the world, with reports of people reenacting some of the \\'games\\' portrayed.It comes together like a fusion, of the wildest excesses of the most fantastical Phillip K Dick novel, and the most blood thirsty Quentin Tarantino film, with a fairly standard format of a group of strangers being thrown together to fight for survival, which has been portrayed in films such as Cube. Like the aforementioned films, there seems to be some societal commentary thrown in, such as increasing poverty and the gap between rich and poor, as well as the depths \\'reality TV\\' could sink to in the name of \\'entertainment.\\'It\\'s definitely been the runaway hit of 2021, that\\'s left quite an impression, and gained quite a cult status, that, in spite of its excessive gruesomeness, can safely be said to be earned. ****,I loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe.,This series is so overrated. But let\\'s be fair, it\\'s a very good series. I\\'ve watched a few movies about it. The script was good. Acting was sometimes exaggerated, maybe it\\'s a cultural thing. I did not like the final part. Overall very well done. In the final episode, my expectation was different. But the final scene was disappointing. Season 2 will come, I hope it doesn\\'t fall into \"La Casa De Papel\" status.,I honestly don\\'t know wtf the main character needed to go into the room where the old man was, dye his hair red and not attempting to board the plane. At the beginning I was having expectations that it would be thrillingly good which it was but the ending just didn\\'t do it for me chief....,It\\'s good because it was on Netflix and everyone who sawed this show also liked it.A show that exceeded expectations because it was so good and had wicked scenes.Oh man. I loved this show very much. The acting and premise was a Glorified excellence.Please watch squid game. Haha. Seriously. It\\'s so good because it was on Netflix.,Greetings from Lithuania.I liked and enjoyed \"Squid Game\" (2021) series for its interesting and simple concept which at the end of the day was very solidly executed. Acting was very solid, as well as directing and writing. The whole concept felt fresh and kinda original and it was easy to get attached and watch the whole show. Ending was also pretty interesting, although a bit predictable.Overall, i enjoyed \"Squid Game\". It felt fresh and was involving as well being believable throughout. I believe that given its popularity it will get more seasons. As long as they will be solid as the first one, I\\'m in for this show.,Squid Games (2021) is a series my wife and I recently watched on Netflix. The storyline follows people who choose to play child\\'s games competitively for money that could change their life forever. Shortly after they arrive they discover the price for losing is rather expensive. This series was directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk (The Fortes and My Father) and stars Lee Jung-jae (New World), Park Hae-soo (Time to Hunt), Oh Yeong-su (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring) and Jung Hoyeon (100%: Beat). The storyline for this series is very unique and was a creative spin on similar films like Battle Royale, Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies. The concepts were well thought-out and paced and the characters are very well developed. The storyline and characters evolve well throughout the series. The games and settings are amazing and they used great colors and cinematography to present each scenario. The costumes and props were obviously outstanding as well. My one complaint was the main character who was painfully annoying throughout the series and completely ruined the end for me. The gore and kill scenes in this are unique and very well done. I\\'d score this series a 7.5/10 and would consider it an absolutely must see.,I recently got into Netflix again I take breaks and use other services glad I finally decided to watch this whacky series! Probably get hate for this but I watch the English dub version cause I don\\'t do well with subtitles still lovable show. The music, flow of everything, absurdity, and story is all excellent!,Squid Game is no show that hit me that much - I watched a couple of episodes and was rather bored, I would prefer to watch some real MMA fights - more excitement and action going on, and less drama. The first episode dragged on and on and on till the first real action. The second episode was a rather redundant detour of the story. The idea or concept is also nothing really new: Stephen King aka Richard Bachman, The Long Walk and The Running Man, or movies like Battle Royal, The Hunger Games, Death Race, Circle, Cube or 13 and many more precede Squid Game. So what\\'s left? Some nice ideas (the games), some solid action and a sip of blood, but with too much uninteresting filler time. Summa summarum: Not that bad but rather just another hype, just my few cents of course.,Korean Drama \"Squid Game\" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful.It has a nice cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action scenes. The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more \\'Korean Drama\\' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 7 out of 10.,Creator and director Dong-hyuk Hwang certainly had one crazy vision, and successfully made a series of it. Sure it has plot and technical issues, and I wasn\\'t fond of the ending - I re-wrote it in my head much better, but for a somewhat newb Korean filmmaker, this was epic.The visuals, props and sets were outstanding. The cinematography and score amazing. The casting and performances by all, except the VIP\\'s, was excellent. Props to Neflix once again, and thanks for dubbing this one right this time. Hoping for a S2 real soon. A well deserved 8/10 from me.,This is another version of The Hunger Games. Contestants are killed without knowing there is a death result from Green Light, Red Light. The majority choose to leave so they go. However a lot come back for the second contest, willingly.The contestants play against each other in a survival of the fittest contest. They play Korean children games, killing each other.If your \"friend\" was going against you for money, would they kill you?,Ep1 wonderful drama that we love, protagonist of dubious character, we didn\\'t even root for him, but I loved his rambunctious behavior, Chips 1, 2, 3, bizarre in the way we love... T2 more drama than blood, we love it too... Ep4 Loving the jokes of macabre and bloodthirsty children, catching love for the characters, and hatred for the villains...\\r\\nEp 6 the construction of the characters was perfect, the games give a sarcastic and sadistic tone, however the dialogues are the high point, with that black humor that the Koreans do so well, the conversations between the characters are intelligent, with a quick script, everything very captivating and mesmerizing, the players and the undercover cop, showing the other side of the game... Lovely..\\r\\nEp 6 And the marbles game brought me a few tears, this was the game where the most innocent characters die, like the Pakistani who just wanted money to help his family who stayed there, his naivety and trust cost him his life , and the girl who killed the father who will kill her mother, and who has just got out of prison, and in the end gives up the game for her partner, perfect scenarios...\\r\\nI finished Round 6, completely in love, I already loved Korean movies, it just came to reaffirm their competence, perfect, everything perfect, I loved the dialogues, super mesmerizing script, the perfect effects, everything great in this production, I even cried... Beautiful, beautiful... But I saw many truths there, in real life it would be more or less like this...,A group of desperate people agree to play high-stakes children\\'s games, and then find how high the stakes really are. The show is an odd mix of nonsense and excellence. The premise is interesting but the ultimate revelation about the games and their founder is simplistic and does little explain the provenance of the vast, complex yet secret game venue. There are some hints at secondary plotlines but they go nowhere and the introduction of wealthy gamblers is a heavy-handed social-commentary that adds nothing to the story (and leads to the weakest moments in the series). The acting and characters are excellent and the dark shifts in their motives and ethics as more and more players are \\'eliminated\\' is expertly done (episode 6, \"Gganbu\" is a highlight). The imagery, especially the creepy geometric enforcers, the \\'play grounds\\' and the multicolored stairs that look like something from an Escher etching is memorable (and may be what really sets \\'Squid Game\\' apart from similar \\'deadly games\\' series). The film is quite violent, both in a cartoony way and in a more visceral \\'realistic\\' and disturbing way. Not to everyone\\'s\\' taste but entertaining and compelling.,A superbly and psychologically deep series that you watch, finish and ponder upon. Just loved the old man with his super charismatic aura and beautiful witty smile.The season\\'s ending is a little ambiguous and as some reviewers mentioned, I too, like it to finish as it is and not come back with a second season that wouldn\\'t do real justice to the S-Korean cinematic culture.They produce, they film and they finish. They do not come back repeatedly...,A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American). They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained.,The usage of children games in an adult world is catchy, but the realism behind all this is somewhat shaky - South Korea is no \"Wild West\" and one can hardly think of events like this happening there, with so large body count... The idea of fierce contests with elimination has been utilised before, plus it is hard to maintain a thrill when there are leading performers from the beginning apparently not dying before the end...Underplots are not too elaborate and they tend to \"mince\" the main plot. Luckily, this anti-capitalist idea is not overhanging too much. The number of episodes could be less, but some good twists in the final one elevated the thrill that began to fade away in e.g. Episodes 7 and 8.However, the performances are interesting, so different for the Western ones, how they react and how they depict, with men more versatile though. Lee Jung-jae and O Yeong-su were most to my liking, the latter providing a nice twist towards the end as well...Season 2 might be underway - based on the ending scenes... I would probably watch it as well. But not impatient though.,The South Korean nine-episode \"survival\" action/drama series \"Squid Game,\" which debuted on Netflix in September of 2021 to international acclaim, is just the latest in a long series of TV shows being imported from Asia that are action-packed, emotionally engaging, and extremely & brutally violent. \"Squid Game,\" which takes its title from a Korean children\\'s game, revolves around people from all over South Korea, all of whom are in terrible financial debt, who risk their lives to participate in a series of deadly contests that are based on children\\'s games. If they survive all six games over a six-day period, they\\'ll walk away with a whopping 45.6-billion won (roughly, a little over $38.5 million in U. S. currency) cash prize.So far, the ending of the first episode has me hooked. Let\\'s see where things go from here...9/10.,A tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses. Combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to.,I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it\\'s nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the \"kill game\" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera.,Yeah, this series is pretty awesome but I don\\'t think it needed another season. And that is the problem, you can feel them stretching out for another season. Greed killed this series for me and nothing else.,Entertaining and demonstrating human nature via this drama. My conclusion is not to be poor otherwise become a chess from rich.,One of the most beautiful series I\\'ve ever seen, finished in a few days one episode led to another and the desire to follow the series increases more and more. The tension is built very well game by game and the main characters are really well developed.,I found Squid Game a hard show to put down. Once you immerse yourself within this show it feels all too real and scary. I find dark shows more engrossing perhaps because they seem realistic and possible. Human nature has a dark and sometimes unforgiving side. This is why shows like Squid game and Black Mirror trend compared to very PG and convenient shows where the good guys always win.Another thing to celebrate here is diversity and globalisation. Squid game, being a Korean show which is set in Korea with Korean actors has broken viewing records. The power of Netflix, through its streaming, has crossed international boundaries and reached so many people. We didn\\'t need to see big Hollywood names or familiar settings in New York or LA. Korea and its brand of actors delivered a great show. Borders in a sense have been broken, coincidentally in a time when a virus physically forces them to close.This show was thought provoking and makes you ask really think about life in general. We\\'re all trying to get rich. But being rich doesn\\'t buy happiness nor does it buy you health.,This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.It uses \"Hunger Games\" as it\\'s base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of \"actors\" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it\\'s meant to be!,So, having heard much about this show and of course the controversies, I knew I had to give it a watch.The show follows 456 players who engage in child like games in order to win £££ prize money, but don\\'t realise how deadly the stakes for the games are!I found the show to be great for the most part, the games they set for the players are dark and twisted versions of the kids games we all remember from our childhoods, I\\'m 27 by the way! The sets were good, the characters were good especially the lead and the english dubbing wasn\\'t too bad! The TV Show is gory & dark in a lot of areas & reminds me of the Hunger Games crossed with Saw!The only things that I found were off were the filler parts of the Show, the talking parts, the drawn out scenes all seemed to drag quite a bit, ok character development is a must, but cutting it down & getting to the point is also a must not to mention consistancy!Overall, it\\'s a good Show with a creative premise and good story to follow! The games are creative with their own dark & sinister twist to them! The Show does drag in areas, but is pretty entertaining all the way! Roll on Series 2!7/10.,Squid GameA very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan\\'s Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the \"losers\" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers \"side-hustle\" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the \"real\" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed \"worthless\".The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but \"manga\" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!I\\'m giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers.,Squid game is a great TV show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money. The TV show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money. I enjoyed the TV show: it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes. Some mysteries also and some big revelations. I enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch. I will recommend anyone to watch this TV Show. It was quite good.,I don\\'t know if it\\'s a must for Netflix shows to become lame at the very end. It became very far-fetched and melodramatic and Gi-hun signaled virtue the whole time as if he didn\\'t get back to the game while he knew he had to kill people and as if he didn\\'t cheat the old man at the marble game. I wish he just stood up and admitted what he did. His mother died and he helped the mother of the other finalist (that stabbed himself in the neck at the squid game) by giving her the money and then took the North Korean girl\\'s brother from the orphanage and before flying to the US to see his daughter, he called the corporate again to make them pay back. And another thing is that the old man was in fact the Korean Jigsaw in the game. He was rich so he wanted to lose track of time just like he\\'d do when he was a child so he did all what he did. And he died at an empty flat right before the sleeping old drunk man in the street received help just like Gi-hun. He died a few seconds before midnight as if we needed more far-fetched stuff.I enjoyed the show except for the final episode. The idea and the execution was good and the acting didn\\'t take me out of it except for the actors who play American guests. I like the characters and their background stories. And on top of all this, there\\'s this amazing episode 6 so I rated it 8 out of 10.,One of the best and most interesting shows I\\'ve seen in recent years. I was hooked right from the start. Far out plot, wonderfully unique and layered characters, and a true breakneck pacing that\\'s sure to keep you glued. I went in rather skeptical since hype has often let me down, but I can honestly say I was dead wrong. As soon as the credits rolled on the final episode, I had half a mind to start a rewatch with the new perspective the ending grants.Incredible.,I really loved this shot series best series of the uear no question asked but the ending kinda bad but overall fantastic.,Squid Game isn\\'t easy viewing at all; and I believe that it was meant to make viewers uncomfortable and distressing as all hell, because that\\'s what desperation with life-and-death situations are truly like, and it can actually break who we are as people.456 players, 45.6 billion South Korean won, six games, and only ONE player can come out as the grand champion after everyone else has been killed. To make matters even worse these people were kidnapped off the streets because of their debts to collectors, yet outside the world is far more unforgiving than the brutal takes on classic kid\\'s games.Netflix managed to strike gold with this show, which I guess took off because of the pandemic\\'s devastating effects on ALL of society, and the themes of desperation and survival resonated with anyone and everyone who tuned into this breakaway mega-hit. It got people so invested it became a massive meme, where people parodied the thing, cooked up fan-theories and mocking the show\\'s all-English dub.In spite of the showy production values in Squid Game, the characters are still very much like real people who\\'ve got real frustrations, real tension inside them, and very real everyone-for-themselves urgency to their character arcs. Squid Game is still a grounded story in spite of its SELECT sci-fi/spy-fi trappings and comic-book-like iconography with the \\'PlayStation Men\\' and mysterious leader.Squid Game is Netflix\\'s unexpected phenomenon; and I reckon there\\'ll be those who understand and appreciate it and those who won\\'t.Memes or no memes, this is a show definitely worth your time.,Review By Kamal KDark portrayals of greed, low self value and distorted view of reality based on the twisted social standards that are rooted in the obsession over money that takes away all the joy of life - all wrapped in a completely unrealistic scenario sprinkled with dark comedy tone, that emphasizes the absurdity of the characters\\' choices and behaviors.The childlike locations and games present a drastic contract to the brutality of the scenarios the characters are facing. The game creators put themselves in the position of innocent keepers of the rules, and any tragic deaths are the fault of the participants for breaking them. No one is forced to participate - you signed your death certificate yourself.Survival in the game and survival in daily life serve as another good contrast - the physical brutality versus the emotional and existential dread. It\\'s more than survival games drama, the true horror is the reality of these people outside of the games and what they can do in the given situation to change it.Blood and murder are this show\\'s best friends, be aware of that before watching. Realistically speaking, this is not some new higher level of gruesome scenes, but they don\\'t shy away from showcasing deaths and accidents.The acting from all the adults was truly amazing. Like in any drama, some roles had more depth and were more demanding than others, but none of the characters felt like an empty placeholder to fill the scene.But then we had the group of foreign actors with such an exaggerated line delivery, I was thinking I\\'d rather mute the screen. Not one of them did a good job. All sounded like licence free sound bites.Any flaws or complaints?Depends on what you are looking for. Do not expect any elaborate death traps and clever tricks - it\\'s far more simple. It is pure survival with technically simple rules and games. You won\\'t wreck your brain trying to understand what is going on, since the plot is rather straightforward with no unexpected plot twists that turn the whole plot upside down.You might want to sit down and analyze the message of the show and what might be the meaning behind. Depending on the viewer it could be a decent kill count watch with a bit of excitement, or a depressing portrayal of collapsing morals and society, as the money sucks all the joy out of our lives.There has also been a random sex scene, and I don\\'t think we needed that \"final\" nail in the coffin - it was clear even without it that people would do anything for survival and money.Some details make exactly zero sense, and I truly mean zero. If you are lucky, you will not notice them at all, since they are less than minor. Squid Game is not exactly free from plot holes, but none of them have a big impact on the story. Some plot lines do hit the dead end though.Overall, it was a brutal drama, yet somehow I found myself laughing at quite a number of scenes. The dark comedy, calling out the hypocrisy - all that was truly amazing. 2/3 of the show was a solid 9.5, and I\\'m a bit frustrated with where the show went after that. Still, quite an enjoyable watch, with interesting set designs, well written characters and some solid thrills. They were able to get me attached to the characters and feel their desperation and pain.,Not sure about all the hype but certainly great fun and slickly made.Nothing really new in the plot. Rich bored gamblers making desperate humans kill each other for their enjoyment.I guess the difference between this and so many before is the excellent character development and talented acting. Direction, cinematography all good. I think Alice in Borderland was slightly more adventurous but this was certainly slicker.A great binge watch!,The series takes specific aim at South Korea but it\\'s certainly universal in 2021, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare so many injustices. Superb acting performances heighten the drama and particularly from Lee, who makes Gi-hun irresistibly likable despite his many defects. All of the characters undergo enormous trauma and the actors rise to the challenge of portraying believable emotions in a very unbelievable setting.,I had fun binging for two days. It\\'s seems like a mashup of the Hunger Games, Saw, Bond villains and wacky Asian reality game show. Very good character development. I felt I knew the characters well halfway in the series. The first two episodes are a little slow, then the show ramps up to speed. The last episode is a tear jerker. The weakest part, as many have said we\\'re the VIPs. It wasn\\'t that their acting was bad, it was the screenplay dialogue was poorly written.It\\'s certainly a different kind of watch most Americans are not used to. But that\\'s a good thing. Netflix makes it easier to watch foreign content so that our cultural bobble burst and we get more diversely made content from around the globe.,Decent set deco .Battle royal flavors.A bit long in runtime, especially after first half.Very bloody and gory at times.Addictive if thats your cup of tv tea.,Fly Me to the Moon\\r\\nLet me play among the stars\\r\\nLet me see what spring is like on\\r\\nA Jupiter and Mars\\r\\nIn other words, hold my hand\\r\\nIn other words, baby, kiss meNow imagine listen to that calming jazz melody, sipping some wine, and watching more than 400 people getting murdered playing some kid\\'s games.A brand new Netflix Korean thriller. This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn\\'t care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there\\'s these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I\\'m not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There\\'s also a subplot about a cop, which didn\\'t pay off well enough at the end.Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON\\'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn\\'t as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn\\'t have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn\\'t feel special. But yeah, that\\'s my ranking of all the rounds in this first season.,For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you\\'ll definitely notice and say when you\\'re watching \"that character is me!\".It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth.As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. That they only find pleasure in people suffer.,Most of the characters are very well written, sadly I can\\'t say the same about the story. A lot of plotholes, and just overall sruff that didn\\'t make sense. But apart from that, most aspects are pretty much fine. So all in all, an above average series but certainly not great or anything.7/10: good but not great.,\"You don\\'t trust people because they are trustworthy. You do it because you have nothing else to rely on\"Squid Game is thoughtful, provocative, and darn productive in every sense. Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some \\'Masterpiece\\'. Contrary to popular belief, it\\'s not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn\\'t be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I\\'m leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it. Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?,So intense, so well crafted, so many meanings, dramatic, sadistic, emotional...television doesn\\'t get much better than this.,Gaming with human lives has been a subject in movies since The Most Dangerous; or even before; any movie about Gladiators was basically about people risking their lives to entertain the public.However, after the worldwide success of PARASITE the subject of social struggle has become preponderant also on the Korean movies.Many from that country like Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Lady Vengeance or Old Boy had lots of references about the social fight ; poor people trying to survive, rich people abusing them; but recently has become the full theme; thus this series.Contrary to expectations; the gore and violence level in the series is not that high; but the drama is.The first 7 chapters is about the people\\'s misery around and why they accept to bet their lives for money. The characters lives are depressing desperate losers and (with one exception) selfish and far from sympathetic; all of them seem to be guilty of their own tragedies.Hundred of people are killed but most of them are unknown or have no empathy. We only get to know only a few of the characters; which will eventually mostly die.The games are not spectacular but the suspense is well crafted.The first problem is that the series is in itself too slow (for my own taste); a faster pace and at least two hours less could make it a lot better.The oppressing classes appears by the final chapters but is more really a caricature than real people. Too cliched for its own good.The second big problem is the resolution. In may ways contradicts all the previous ideas. Perhaps preparing people for a follow up.In brief; it requires a lot of patience the the depiction of the human condition and the consequences of bad choices make it worth a view (if you and your family can bear the killings).,Season 1: Despite a notable lack of momentum during fair amounts of Squid Game\\'s dialogue, Hwang Dong-hyuk\\'s concept itself is extraordinarily compelling and fun. Especially during the dystopian child\\'s-games sequences, the performances are incredibly lifelike and plenty of shocks are delivered. Seriously, minus the slow-burning dialogue, grab some snacks and you\\'re ready for an unforgettable binge.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.,But there were some plot holes. The cop should have been caught ten times before he died but he magically escaped or the scene just went out.Also, I never understood the organ harvester, where he came from and how he was able to ply his trade...But I really enjoyed the series except of a couple of the later episodes where there was an inordinate amount of blah blah blah.,A pretty gripping show that has 7 solid episodes.Sadly it has one filler episode and falls apart a bit at the end, but for the most part it\\'s a season that you can\\'t stop watching.Definitely worth a watch and am recommending to my friends.Don\\'t think it needs a second season but I imagine one will be made.,So Squid Game has taken over the world these last few weeks and I thought that I had to watch it and I have now finished it and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck Koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize.Main Character\\r\\nLee Jung-Jae plays the lead character Gi-Han on the show and he is fantastic. At first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions. As he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support.Supporting Characters\\r\\nThere is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.Story\\r\\nThe story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn\\'t work for me and I think it could have been handled better. Also there are these English speaking VIP\\'s and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.Script\\r\\nThe script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles. For the love of everything holy don\\'t watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching.Style\\r\\nThe show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole. It is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale. The pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and great in there own way.Overall\\r\\nOverall, Squid Game is a truly fantastic show that was so close to getting my 10/10 score. It is a must watch and don\\'t let the language barrier turn you off and get started with it as soon as possible.Rating - 9/10.,A great story and sufficient background to get the series started with the pilot episode. But by the 4th eps it\\'s dragging quite a bit and they make a scene ensuring that all the games are of \"fair play\".Two games later they throw out this concept and it\\'s all based on luck instead of skill. Absolutely terrible games of chance.This dude shopped this project around for 10 years before Netflix picked it up. Maybe in that time he should have had a few buddies proof read the script and give him some pointers. This needs work.I\\'m sure that there will be a season 2 for this, hopefully with some better talent can help this dude write a better script. Could have been a 9 star series but just got boring and predictable.,When he finally wins some money...only to lose it 3 seconds later, i turned it off and didnt come back for a while. But eventually I did and it is pretty good. Of course it drags 30 minute episodes into 1 hour long episodes..but its still good. Both twists were so predictable. The police brother and the old man were so obvious...and what is the message of the show...Being rich is just awful...lol Korea must have lots of poor people.,Perfect to binge watching, this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted, twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments. While not really perfect, this is a perfectly fine Netflix entertainment. Totally recommended!,This is a show that asks us a simple question - is mankind inherently good or inherently evil? The answers the show comes up with may surprise you. I loved all nine episodes - it was funny, tragic, violent, and suspenseful. There was some gore in this show - but it wasn\\'t done without catharsis. The acting in this show is just tremendous, especially the lead actor. And the writing is excellent. One of the most important binge shows of our time.,So.... the ENTIRE premise is based on \\'let\\'s play games that we played as kids, that were based on skill and that are completely fair, and we\\'re ALL on equal ground\\'.... series keeps that premise from EP01 until EP05, where it becomes not only a rigged game, but also no longer based on skill, but COMPLETELY based on luck. This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of \"we play fair games against each other, based on skill\" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn\\'t completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series. I think they should make a Season2, and I just hope to God that in Season2, they don\\'t completely derail the premise like they did in Season1, because Season1 is completely spoiled because of that.,This country is already done if this is the greatest show of the year. This is cheap and lame, and if this is what is entertaining to people, I really fear for the future.,I just watched this because of the hype. I really enjoyed the series even it\\'s predictable parts.First, acting is mostly great from main characters but some of the secondary are pretty amateurish.Second, the story and ideas are not original but are pretty well executed even I didn\\'t like the overall conclusion.Last, I wish a bit of more risky script because there are only a few unpredictable situations or plot twists if you have watched similar series/movies.So, overall great but not perfect.,\"Squid Game\" is definitely a slow burn in its first 2 episodes (but they do give you a taste of what\\'s to come). As for the rest of the season, you probably won\\'t be able to stop watching thanks to its story, characters, thrills, twists, games and, of course, gore.,If you enjoy Korean movies then this is a must see. Has become a real hit, cool idea, interesting games and drama. Plenty of story to continue more seasons , I\\'ve got final 2 EPs left but have really enjoyed up to this point.,Typical Korean ott actionand some real life back stories thrown in for good measure.Was good to see a non Korean, Ali Abdul, in this.Thoroughly entertaining and a great distraction from all the madness in the world.,This is a great show to binge watch, even if it doesn\\'t introduce anything all that new and original.The fact that it isn\\'t American made means that it\\'s one show that Netflix couldn\\'t poison with its toxic political agendas. It\\'s just the vision of its creators - and that\\'s fresh nowadays.I know people complain about the ending, but if you watch Alice in Borderlands (which you should, it\\'s also a great show, Japanese this time) you\\'ll know what a bad ending really is. That show didn\\'t end with any conclusion.But Squid Game, trust me, it will have more seasons due to its success, but even if it didn\\'t, it ended nicely, pretty much answering most questions and delivering good conclusions to everything. If anything, I believe more seasons would ruin this, but let\\'s see what happens.In any case, the hype is real, this is a good show you should watch, just don\\'t expect groundbreaking character development or much originality. The characters are mostly cliches we\\'ve seen before, and so is the concept of deadly games.But, again, the standards are low nowadays, and this show is just captivating and interesting enough to raise above everything else there is to watch right now.,Squid Game is a different type of show and I\\'m all for it! I really liked watching this the hidden message seems to be about the crisis of debt in south korea and just how far some desperate people are willing to do for some cash. I thought it was a very intense adventure that was followed, such an entertaining craft this show has been made into. I avoided the reviews upon watching, instead i decided to give it a go and I\\'m glad i did as its very engaging to the point you cannot watch one episode, this is definitely a bingeworthy one to catch as soon as possible, before the internet ruins it for you.I definitely recommend watching this, some moments will have you laughing although others will have you the complete opposite, it got me good on some parts in both ways.Check it out! Now on Netflix!,This new take on an old story makes for a compelling mini series. . We tend to miss out on gems in the states due to poor or no dubbing and laziness. Movies like oldeboi and sympathy for lady vengeance felt groundbreaking then and so I can understand the hype for seemingly obscure South Korean entertainment rn. Then of course, because of the hype i almost missed out on this. So if your on the fence give it a go. Not quite as predictable as the same old .I appreciate Netflix making foreign shows more accessible.,Is this show art or sadistic hype? Or just criticism of capitalism? The cynical display of social injustice in Squid Game is not a pose. The South Korean screenwriter and director Hwang Dong-hyuk came up with the idea for the series during the 2008 financial crisis - brutally and directly.The series is a criticism of the world as it is. A double-edged sword. The protagonist Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) - an unemployed chauffeur who slipped into gambling addiction after losing his job - depends not only on the prize money to gain custody of his daughter, but also to one to pay for an important operation for his mother. He becomes part of a show for life and death.A mass extinction staged by Netflix. Is this good or bad? You can look at it, even if a lot is reminiscent of Stephen King.,RATED 8/10\\r\\nLanguage: Korean-Tamil\\r\\nSource: Netflix\\r\\nRECOMMENDEDLiked the first episode and it was so intriguing to continue the further episodes. Its pure entertaining series with some of the episodes are so predictable. The human emotions and situations makes it more interesting to watch. The Tamil translation is so good, not like crappy movie dubbing.Has lot of bad words and gory sequences.,This was an absolutely unique and honestly surprisingly great show. For a show based out of a different country and filmed in a different language to still have this effect on everyone universally says a lot about how good it is. Excited for the next season.,What I liked about itVery addicting for most of the series. Couldn\\'t let go of it.Except for a couple actors, I thought the overall acting was pretty good. MINYU was particularly noticeable - super obnoxious character.Plus points for pulling off a genre that wasn\\'t attempted in K-dramas before.The set and the overall color of the series. Very vibrant color in contrast to the rather grotesque story the series portrayed. Loved that.Decent ending for the games. Was an unexpected ethos of arriving to a rather predictable conclusion.Just the right amount of gore for my taste.----What I didn\\'t like about itVIPs were so cringe. I suppose it\\'s hard to find decent English speaking non Korean actors in Korea. They were truly atrocious.Unclear messaging. Maybe not unclear - just a bit messy job conveying the message.Ep 8-9 were a little dragged on - could have had faster pace.The cop storyline was a little off-putting. Wish we saw more depth and development in there.,I don\\'t understand the hype. Alice in borderland is much more better than this. Maybe it get it\\'s hyped because of Netflix,I don\\'t see any other reason.,I loved this show for many reasons. The story was great I loved the concept and characters. The violence and gore was great too. The downfall is the bad acting at times it\\'s kinda laughable bad. Overall a great surprise and I want more seasons even if it\\'s with a new cast. I want more !!!,I mean, I\\'d say I liked The Hunger Games better - but not The Maze Runner. There\\'s a real grimness to The Squid Games. Like The Platform. With every episode you\\'re ground down deeper just like these poor saps who find themselves there. I liked it well enough though it was long and the characters pretty familiar to this genre. It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali\\'s story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok\\'s and the way we treat people just seeking a better life. I can\\'t say I get the uproar of the series - Netflix\\'s potential biggest- but it\\'s worth a watch if you like dystopian stuff - and who doesn\\'t?,Its different but the same basically a different take on the violent game shows were nobody really wins. Episode 6 was the best episode. If there\\'s a season two it needs to be the revenge.,Believe the hype this is one of the best shows to ever hit Netflix. Every episode gets better and better and the acting is spot on. The action scenes are beautiful the whole concept is crazy but in this case crazy works.,This is definitely a special show and I was hooked from the very beginning with the first game played. While some plot elements are somewhat obvious with who the winner will be because of the main character being established early on, there are plenty of unexpected twists and turns. Plus, the directing style with the camera work, choice of colors, set designs, editing, etc was very artistic and noteworthy. The acting from a few specific characters as well deserves praise, I greatly enjoyed the show and always couldn\\'t wait for more!,This tv show is very good to me, something different from what we are used to watch, for me is very original.,The plot is similar to SAW and LOST. But,the Korean makers have given enough depth to the characters in this web series, that you feel for the characters even though it is predictable. There are enough shock value moments that keeps you hooked. Worth binge watching!!,The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I\\'ll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I\\'m out.,Utterly gripping, engrossing, and devastating, Squid Games hit\\'s a level of tension few other series have. It\\'s not perfect, a little consistent for a single episode, but it is so absorbing at every other moment it seems impossible to mark the series down.Characters are distinct, develop brilliant bonds and each have their own developmental arc. Certain characters show such morality and innocence that investment is put into their stories almost instantly. Backstories are a mixture of tragic and sinister, providing a footing for the audience to base their impressions, but these are twisted and warped so brilliantly throughout that a fully-fleshed out character is always the final product.Acting cannot be faulted, and as a newcomer to Korean TV, all impressions of the actors are fresh. Outbursts of emotion are very explosive, and should be seen and heard in Korean to fully appreciate them.The plot has maybe been played out in various ways in past media, but possibly without such a holistic approach. Down-on-their-luck participants playing life-or-death children\\'s games seems simple, but the execution is perfect due to the building tension. Violence is graphic and intense, but the gore comes in relatively short bursts. The progression of each episode gives the violence such power.One episode in particular is crushing, once a connection has been formed between the audience and each character. The cruelty of each game is paramount, but the reactions within them are devastating.Unfortunately, the most devastating episode is followed by the most disappointing. The introduction of the VIPs is so below the standard of the rest of the characters/series, leaving them out completely and keeping some irritating mystery would have been a lot more satisfying than the lacklustre impact they make. Built on cliches and stuck with terrible dialogue not improved by the acting, it\\'s the one episode that goes against the rest of the series.Having said that, it may have been a necessary evil. It matches with the storyline, but still felt like an addition no one wanted. It cannot detract from the entire series though, everything before is brilliant, everything after saves it again, producing a worthy ending.,A little too much of an advertised series for my taste. I decided to give it a try anyway, there aren\\'t a lot of episodes anyway. Overall, I have to admit that it is a very good series, the best part of it are some of the characters and how various circumstances and the environment affect them. I was mentally prepared for the violence and the blood so it didn\\'t surprise me, I even thought the violence would be even more pronounced. Of these nine episodes, three were below level for me personally, including an ending I didn\\'t like. There are also a few elements in the series that aren\\'t original because we\\'ve seen them before, it\\'s not a new concept of how people fight to the death to win a competition. It is somewhat predictable. That\\'s why everything else in the series is at a very high level, the story, the characters, the mystery, I give it two thumbs up.,This is the first Korean drama I\\'ve watched while I was absolutely blown away. There were a couple of moments where I thought the story dragged a little, however it was all added for tension I\\'m sure. It was absolutely stunning to look at and really well done. I can\\'t wait to see what happens in the next series.,Hype that will not stand up with time. This series does not measure up to the standards of good, much less great, Korean Drama. The cast is excellent, of course (except for the VIPs, though the inside joke on American actors is rich), but the plot is predictable from the beginning through to the end. From the moment 001 (the old man\\'s number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable.However. Blessings on Netflix for bringing international film to the world, especially during the pandemic. But don\\'t try to own it, guys: just stream it.,Wow!! No show has ever stressed me out as much as this one. It was seriously insane and crazy and hilarious all at once. Kept me on the edge of my seat that\\'s for sure. It had me laughing and crying and terrified.,I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode. I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental \"here is why\" explanation. I believe that was obvious. The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode.It\\'s worth a go. It teaches age old lessons again but it\\'s always worth learning them, again.,A battle royale vibe with more to say about the world we live in. Well written, designed, acted and a credit (as if we needed another one) to Korean film and TV makers.,The talk and reviews have me bewildered, I\\'m only up to Ep3 but am struggling after about 5 attempts to start bingeing.I find it boring and really childish, with pretty ordinary acting.The set design, art direction and general production values are very 1970\\'s.Two more attempts then I\\'ll give up.,Caught a bit by the hype I decided to check this out and boy was I in for a convoluted messy nonsense pile of garbage.I will not go through all the problems with each episode but rather describe the three overarching issues I have with the show.1) the acting - the acting is fine from the 3-4-5 main characters, everyone else however are horrible at it. Someone said that is the point, okay, sure, but if so you direct them different and give them less to do and more to the point scenes so their extremely bad acting do not shine through.2) the production value - this is so low budget that I had a good cry at least half a dozen times each episode. Sets are literary falling apart and you can clearly see the bad construction. You can also hear the lousy music, see the bad clothing, the low quality film work etc. Etc. This is like high-school students having a laugh level of production value.3) Cliche and tiresome nonsense - we have seen all of this many, many times before. All done better, with better acting, better production value, better directing, better story and with a lot better social criticism. This is just a bored Korean mixing some of his favourite movies and tv shows together into nonsens while claiming he is doing the world a favour by exposing capitalism... yawn... Perhaps look a bit north you dirty wet sock of a man you.Put the above together with further critique of each episode and you have some boring nonsense no one should care about. Not sure why people do, but people running around with face masks injecting themselves and bending over for the global elite is surely to like anything you put in front of them. A generous 3/10 and I can not recommend anything about this.,It\\'s a breathe of fresh air to see actors not acting like god and stuck in attack-victimise-saviour loops.But by the 4th episode the main villain (in the game), after being really villainous, is treated like a hero and is given nearly all the screen time. The viewer doesn\\'t want to see this guy anymore...After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral. The whole story turns into a confused cliche to skip through.,This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: \"The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let\\'s go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let\\'s give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let\\'s pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!\"The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let\\'s be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they originally are comedians. The best actor in the whole show is the main character\\'s daughter and she\\'s only in it for a couple of minutes.As per usual for a Netflix production the story is stretched very thin in order to make it nine hours (!) long.,It\\'s been so long since Netflix produced something that\\'s actually good. It\\'s not really surprising that Squid Game arrived from the Eastern cinema, considering the Western Cinema has been dry out of ideas for years at this point. Squid Game is just such a breath of fresh air in 2021, because so far in this year all we got was trash.This show is just so compelling in almost every way. The characters all have differing personalities and ideas and motives, making each character likable in their own different ways. There\\'s no such thing as a \"perfect\" character in Squid Game; everybody is trying to win and they\\'ll give up their own morals to survive. This show focuses on the dark sides of humanity, and it doesn\\'t shy away of what people can do to each other, and that\\'s why this show is so refreshing, because we have realistic people doing realistic things.The overall concept of Squid Game isn\\'t really all that innovative, (a battle royal-ish game being spectated by privileged rich people), but everything around it is innovative. The set design is just fantastic. It\\'s colorful with a bright aesthetic which contrasts well with the dark themes. The directing and acting is also really solid all around, and the pacing is perfect. The only issue being a subplot that ends up leading to nothing.Squid Game is an overall masterpiece of a show. It\\'s extremely thrilling and it\\'ll pull your heartstrings. It\\'s an easy show to get emotionally invested in, and it ends in the most dramatic way possible. This is a show that I\\'d recommend to anyone and I really hope they make a second season, because this is the content that we need in dry times like these.,SummarySquid Game is a series with a wonderful production design, a staging that displays a powerful iconography and that admits several readings and records various influences and cinematographic antecedents. Anyway, it is mostly a thriller and a melodrama. Erecting it as a sociopolitical essay is perhaps an excess, although the crude allegory of neoliberal capitalism is clear and its anti-meritocratic message is accurate.REVIEW:456 people with a desperate economic situation agree to risk their lives in a series of games that take place in a concentration environment to win a significant sum of money.I am a person who distrusts the massive successes, so I began to see the series with all the precautions of the case; however, it turned out to be an extremely interesting experience.The gamesThe participants become part of a regime that is concentration-oriented for more than one reason: because of seclusion, military surveillance, because of its violence, cruelty and sadism, and because of its disregard for the human condition and life. The games (based on children\\'s games) are extremely different and generate different and changing dynamics between the participants and a variety of climates between the chapters, although they all display different types of violence. The fewer participants there are, the bigger the prize becomes.The playersThose who play these games constitute a heterogeneous group of desperate people, generally downfalls of the system and highly indebted, the latter situation that alludes to a widespread problem that afflicts South Korea. Their situation pushes them to put their lives at risk, to which they no longer find meaning, and to commit atrocious acts for economic salvation. Little by little the plot will focus on a group of characters, some of whom nevertheless retain traits of humanity in the midst of despair.The systemOne of the first questions that assail the viewer is who is behind the Squid Game, who is organizing it and for what purpose. Unveiling this unknown is essential for the credibility of the story. What\\'s more, it is initially the most intriguing part of the series, as the games and the place where they take place exhibit an extremely sophisticated and expensive organization and infrastructure.Production design and stagingOne of the highlights of the series is its wonderful production design: colorful, creative, elegant and imposing. It exhibits a powerful iconography that allows you to create a world of your own. As in all Korean series, the staging is brilliant, from the intimate melodramatic scenes to the suspense or violence of the games or in combination. Knows how to use the sequence shot and the fixed shot.The gendersThe series can be defined as a thriller profusely watered with gore, crossed, as in any Korean production worth its salt, by the most resounding melodrama when it investigates the stories and motivations of its characters and their interactions during and outside of games. At a certain point, he even ventures into the western.The cinematographic backgroundSquid Game, due to its internal logic, recognizes several cinematographic antecedents; Among others, one can cite Cronenberg\\'s Videodrome and the saga The Hunger Games, only that it takes place in a rigorous present. But there is another little-cited reference: the concentration regime and other elements refer to Pasolioni\\'s Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Other aspects are reminiscent of Eyes Wide Shut by Kubrick. Its powerful iconography and staging that create worlds of their own can also be assimilated to those of The Handmaid\\'s Tale.Social, economic and political readingsAlthough I consider that these readings are somewhat overvalued or overanalyzed, it is clear that the dynamics of the games and their participants can be assimilated to that of neoliberal capitalism in its extreme forms (as was Nazism at the time), so much so that it concerns the participants as well as their organizers; it even raises up to a culmination of its predatory logic. A supposed and cynical framework of equal opportunities governs where, however, chance is decisive and despair and the promotion of extreme individualism permanently abort the collective organization. The series also shatters the meritocratic fantasy.The performancesThe performances are very good; They range from naturalism to a certain common buff emphasis on oriental gestures and dramaturgy. They generate empathy and mixed feelings based on the changing behaviors of their characters.The soundtrackSpecial mention for the remarkable soundtrack, which, as in the story, ranges from meditative piano solos to frenetic rhythmic sequences.,Netflix K-drama might offer nothing new as a survival-show dystopian thriller but deft writing and fine craftsmanship made it worth the hype even for international audience. Some gratuitous violence over nail-biting twists and turns kept our interest till the end.Each contestants for some reasons had purposes due to rounded character developments. They took \\'companionship\\' to next level including shocking revelations we could barely see. Convincing ensemble cast effectively triggered audience to pick sides in every deathly familiar games.My most to leave fave:\\r\\n1. Tug of War\\r\\n2. Glass Bridge\\r\\n3. Red Light Green Light\\r\\n4. Honeycomb Shape Cutting\\r\\n5. Squid Game\\r\\n6. Marble Games.,Animal World is in my top 10 all-time favorite movies, largely because it was truly an ORIGINAL plot & was so well executed! I love it for it\\'s ORIGINALITY. The further along this series gets, the more I\\'m starting to enjoy it, but also it\\'s becoming an IRREFUTABLE doppelganger of \"Animal World!\" From the debt, the transportation of the contestants, the Mom who\\'s going into the hospital for serious health issues and he can\\'t pay for it, the main character blowing his money on betting & being a child-like burden on his elderly Mom, signing away his Mom\\'s house, the friend who betrayed him (when he knew what the candy-cutting game was) even knowing his friend will likely die and he had multiple opportunities to clue him in, the fact that they\\'re way out on an island (cruise ship) where no one would expect them to be & couldn\\'t find them, even to the organ harvesting! On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they\\'ve hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I\\'m right or wrong. It\\'s a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don\\'t use a movie like a precise blueprint, that\\'s just plagiarism! So, because i love the premise so much, I\\'m hooked and have to see it to the end, even if it irritates me!,I feel like I can\\'t really write a critical review because the TV show is that popular. Everyone is raging about it and it will end up making a billion dollars even though they for some reason only sold it for like $20m to Netflix. The first 5 episodes is great cinema. It\\'s a great concept with people playing games with each other for a big money prize at the very end and the losers get killed. The 3 first games are fine enough, but only the first one is great. It does feel like it\\'s always a promise of something bigger and better. Some big reveal that will make the TV show better and deliver on all the hidden factors. But in reality the more they reveal the worse the show gets. It\\'s like revealing the monster in a movie to be some bad CGI creature. Episode 6 already contains a very weak nonsensical game. And the last 2 games are bad. So out of 6 games only 1 was good! That\\'s pretty lame. The twist and turns also all lead to a worse TV show unfortunately. The first 2 episodes promise something big, but instead the show jumps the shark.A gang starts killing other competitors. But why? The more participants are left the higher is your own chance of survival as each participant is testing the games and finding out how to play them better so that everyone\\'s chance of survival increases. So if the gang didn\\'t kill anyone their chance of survival would skyrocket and they could just kill anyone they want before the last game.There is also a side-plot with a cop filming everything. This plot goes nowhere. He is just killed by his brother who runs the game place. But what the cop does makes no sense. For example, as he escapes they see him climb down a ladder. Before they got to him he had already put on a random diving suit and jumped into the water. So we are to believe this happened in maybe 2 minutes? We didn\\'t even know if he could dive or not. It\\'s also not clear why his brother runs the place. He just left his small cheap apartment suddenly and let his fish die to be this extremely powerful figure? The cop later throws his oxygen tanks on a beach while a boat searches for him. So of course they see the oxygen tank from afar and know he is there. These sort of things at the end of the show make no sense. He could have easily hidden on the island and then later found some fishing boat he could wave at.The main problem is of course the big reveal. It\\'s all a violent show for billionaires so they watch people in debt kill each other for a prize. This idea has been explored a thousand times before in many B movies and it doesn\\'t work here either. These Westerners are HORRIBLE actors. It\\'s inexcusable. You can easily get a random person to act better than this. But I assume they were directed by someone who didn\\'t speak English? The episodes they are in are obviously not fun to watch for anyone.And then there are the game rules. They make no sense and are not clearly explained. At times you see some huge twist in a game and a participant saying \"Well, you said the rules were such and such so that\\'s how I won the game\". So after the fact we get some info about how this guy broke a game. This is a thing in all 6 games. The rules are vague and winners and losers just come about by some mystery. It\\'s not terrible, just a bit weak as it makes little sense. In game 5 on the glass panels you even see the game maker shut off the light to make the game harder as they were near the very end. The game maker needed the last game to only have 2 survivors as only 1 winner is allowed. So while everyone thinks there is no limit and groups plan to win together in reality only one person can win yet no one knows this besides the game maker himself. This is also why the moderators let people kill each other and change the games as they are ongoing to kill a few more people. Also, the gang gets info about what game they are to play beforehand. Kinda a huge deal. These sort of changes and twists make it harder to really feel like these are real games. Rather it\\'s just methods to kill people. The rules are never fair. At one point a game maker even takes part in a game and makes his own team win. Honestly, the reveals are horrible. The brother reveal makes no sense as we don\\'t even know how the cop or brother is. And the old guy who also plays the games is a bad reveal too because it\\'s just a random twist. It\\'s not some info we were looking for.The ending makes no sense either. The winner doesn\\'t spend any money even though he promised to help some specific people. Family members of friends killed in the game. And at the end he just walks somewhere. We never really understand what his plans are. If he or 500 other people wanted to they could have revealed the game. We even see him talk to cops. And many others surely also talked to cops. Even in the VIP areas were see a bunch of waiters and naked ladies just laying around. So all these random naked ladies know about all these murders too. Of course all the workers know about this too. If you want to have an ending with the winner trying to reveal the whole thing that makes absolutely no sense because he could have tracked this whole operation down in a week. They leave clues everywhere. If you put this info online people would find the location in a day. They would just search for underground buildings with huge automatic roofs that can open. Such projects would have thousands of workers and can be seen from space. This part of the TV show makes zero sense so having the lead decide to finally do something about it after a year makes no sense whatsoever. He could have revealed it all in a day. Anyone could. This and then the 2 big twist reveals are terrible. It\\'s not really anything huge so you may just ignore it. But it illustrates how bad the writing actually is. It shows why the games are stupid and lazy too. It\\'s not smart stuff.,Squid Game had one of the best concepts, with mystery around few people who participates in a game with millions to win. The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series.The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next.The story went through well with a good last episode as well. But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season).,Story, Script, Twist and Plot 4/5\\r\\nCharacters 4/5\\r\\nCinematography 3/5\\r\\nActing 3/5\\r\\nVisuals 4/5\\r\\nFun or Interesting 3/5\\r\\nMemorable Scenes 4/5\\r\\nMusic and Soundtrack 3/5\\r\\nOrginality 4/5\\r\\nStyle 3/5.,A large group of people who are down on their luck are invited to a game where all their money troubles can be solved. The only thing they don\\'t know is that it will be a bloody battle for survival and they will each learn how far they will go just to survive. It is a little predictable in the overall concept but does have some surprises in leading up to the finale. Well acted and a reasonable pace over 9 episodes with a few plot twists keeps your attention.,Korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on Netflix called Squid Game.Taking inspiration from the simple childhood games played in Korea, a shadowy organization embarks on recruiting out-of-luck people who are burdened by large debts. They then proceed to make these \\'contestants\\' participate in life-or-death versions of these simple games with a large pot of cash as a reward on offer for the final victor.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the genius director behind Silenced (2011) and The Fortress (2017), weaves a rich tapestry of intricate characters ranging from a Machiavellian investment banker to a lazy absentee dad to a North Korean refugee turned pick-pocket.Despite the immense production value and sets, it is these finely written characters that capture your imagination and sucker you into binging the 9-episode thrill ride at a stretch.Lee Jung-jae is electric as the gambling addict who has to embark on the game to cure his mom\\'s illness while O Yeong-su captivates with his nuanced portrayal of an elderly man with seemingly nothing to lose, slowly dying with an ever-growing tumor in his head.Park Hae-soo plays all the layers of his troubled investment banker role with gusto, portraying all the ethical dilemmas and moral turpitude his character faces with conviction. Jung Ho-yeon buys you into the North Korean defector role and the lengths to which she will go to secure the money to enable the rest of her family to cross over to the South.With the storyline pointing clearly towards a Season 2, the director has left enough plot points incomplete to keep the audiences eager for the next instalment of this landmark series.Netflix seemingly has another worldwide sensation on its hands just as Money Heist seems to be drawing to a close.Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!,Pros:\\r\\n1. There is great use of the colour palette, with greys, blacks, whites, browns and navy blues in the outside world used to portray a miserable, lifeless and oppressive world, whereas bright colours are used for Squid Game to ironically convey a place of death where they felt more alive and unburdened than they did in the outside world.2. The gore is brutal and gut-wrenching, but it\\'s never over-the-top which helps the gore feel more real.3. The fight/ action scenes are raw and gritty, with the usage of close-up shots to heighten the claustrophobia and personal touch, thereby heightening the tension.4. The score does an incredible job at building up the atmosphere, in addition to being instantly recognisable.5. The deaths of Ali (Anupam Tripathi) Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) and Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) are deftly handled and are real tear-jerkers.6. The practical effects and set design are beautifully designed and they do an amazing job at building the Squid Game world.7. The show provides a really good psychological study on how humans react when their lives and fortunes are on the line, i.e. Self-preservation or cooperation; decisive or indecisive.8. Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is on the receiving end of a satisfying character ark from irresponsible, lazy and indecisive, to the complete opposite.9. There are phenomenal performances by Lee Jung-jae and Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo).Cons:\\r\\n1. The flashbacks inserted to reiterate information the show has already told the audience, are redundant and patronising.2. It\\'s baffling, and largely unbelievable, that the Squid Game operation has been going since 1999, yet only one cop in the recent year found multiple disappearances strange enough to investigate - and he was only investigating because of his brother.3. It was far too easy for Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-Joon) to infiltrate the secret island. You\\'d think that type of operation wouldn\\'t make it as easy as they did to sneak onto the island.4. A lot of the information divulged during the show is done so via lazy exposition, the show doesn\\'t seem to deem the audience intelligent enough to work things out for themselves.5. The criticism of the modern Neo-liberal, hyper-individualistic, capitalist system is rather on-the-nose, and it feels preachy and pretentious most of the time. There\\'s a bizarre sub-theme of anti-Americanism and white supremacy that just feels forced.6. There is a ridiculous amount of screen-time wasted on a bizarre organ-harvesting sub-plot that doesn\\'t go anywhere, and is clearly just placed so that the show can air the supposed virtue of equality and fairness, whilst Front man (Lee Byung-hun) who airs it, sanctions the killings of people who for whatever reason, found themselves in debt.,Takes the physiological killer game show idea from anime and manga and adapts into live action. After you get past the premise you actually find well written characters and doomed relationships which is very refreshing for an Anime plot. You find yourself liking people and cursing their inevitable death. I loved the extra side plot refreshing from some of the boring games they played. Don\\'t watch this for the premise watch it for the relationships.,Great show. Korean drama that is perceivable for N. American Audience. Similar story attempts have been made in the past, but this one has a great blend of Drama with a little unpleasantries.,I mean its okay but drags on forever, the story was good nothing to write home about.I am happy a Korean Drama gets hyped even if its unwarranted means they are getting noticed,\\'d recommend this but have the ff botton ready.,Yes, it\\'s like the Japanese game genres like Liars Game, Death Note...etc but much more interesting characters and social commentary.Yes, in its core a social experiment like Lord of the Flies but then the main character is from A Man for all Seasons. The show basically ask will you be true to yourself? Do you have a price? The main guy, although a gambler, stayed true to himself as a nice person(deep down), believes in the goodness of humanity. Goodness of other people. (Just look at his smiley photo snapshot). Even though he won, he was much troubled by the lives lost, disgusted by the money, and dumbfounded by the \"reasoning\" behind it all.001, the number one man(1% of the world?) is basically echoing the sentiment of \"rosebud\" from Citizen Kane and laments the place where adults can never return to...childhood. But do you think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson would have watched this show? (Maybe Elon Musk). Na, they have a space race to run.There are many threads to follow up on if there\\'s a 2nd season. The origin of this game. The cop that jumped off the cliff. The recruiter in the subway. And obviously will the main character go back to another game? And if so what will he do?I get there are bad acting segment with the VIP. But the they do serve the representation of crass upper class. Overall the length of the series is just right. Detail oriented, simple games, thoughtful interactions (the marble episode comes to mind), tense (first game, voting, tug of war, formation of groups ) and full of all the character arch (good, bad and ugly) of humanity. Great cinematography, color palette, bgm score, sets, character development, production and plot.The final game on the island is not a game but a duel of values. And ask again, will you be true to yourself? Same with the last bet on his death bed from the old man. But the irony is that he lost not only the bet but also his life. Double irony that he didn\\'t get to see the results.Do you believe in the goodness of people?,The game is hell, the reality is hell. Japanese-style survival game + Korean-style dog blood. Lying all the way to win the new mode of the game, I feel not as good as the \"gambling implied record\". Human nature cannot be directly seen. The simpler the game, the more thorough the exposure of the ugly side of human nature. The purity of children\\'s games and the life-to-life struggle between adults form a contrast, which is even more ironic. The character settings, personalities, and relationship portrayals are not bad. But the reversal of the ending is really a forced reversal, anticlimactic.,I tend to argue that when South Korean creators are at their peak, they\\'re giving 150%. This intensity and occasional brutality (the works hold back neither in terms of the raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like Secret Sunshine and Oldboy, while close to flawless, don\\'t necessarily find pop-culture success the world over.But we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to South Korean media than bouncy BTS videos, more so than when Parasite arrived and gave the Korean Wave a considerable push. For all their problems, we can thank Netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform.I was incredibly excited to watch Squid Game, even though I at first deemed it \"suspiciously popular\". What was it? One of those rare pieces of media that\\'s clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be \"hip\", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven\\'t seen this type of art yet? (Or maybe those who only watched it because Korean media is the current \"cool\" thing to consume and didn\\'t grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don\\'t make sense about the setting, which, as per the show\\'s themes and social satire, aren\\'t supposed to make sense).Ultimately, Squid Game (original title Ojing-eo Geim) proved to mostly be the former. That is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don\\'t understand it and enjoy it \"in spite of some plot holes\").At a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of The Hunger Games and Saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it\\'s also a better social metaphor than The Platform). A varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a Kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children\\'s games for a reward of 45 billion won. However, should they lose, the penalty is instant death.This becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave. It\\'s around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking. I won\\'t reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn\\'t end at episode 2 of 9. Subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare.The characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable. We go from loathing the down-on-his-luck Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden \"Player 1\" (O Yeung-su) harbors strategic insight. There are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone.There is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character. I was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize I might not be joking. Squid Game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons.Some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious. That being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the Gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of TV/streaming I\\'ve seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft). It\\'s not as unpredictable as Game of Thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it\\'s hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest. This isn\\'t the same as Plot Armor.My only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a Hunger Games sequel, complete with cartoonish Rich People™ from across the world, including ones who speak American English (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not English). And yes, I will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show\\'s poetry and dramatic timing.Still, Squid Game is quite the piece of work and I could praise it for far longer than I already have. Its success sets a good precedent. Like Parasite (another far-reaching showcase of South Korean vigor), Squid Game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won\\'t be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it\\'s \"cool\" or not. Still, it\\'s hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show\\'s message.I\\'m told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on TikTok, and for what it\\'s worth, the mainstream reaction could\\'ve been much worse. (My generation isn\\'t much smarter than Zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in Project X.) We might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what I\\'m truly spaeing is for Elon Musk or whatever to take a look at this and go \"Squid Game, huh? That sounds pretty neat!\",A masterful series for its great script and interpretation of its actors. Lee Jung-jae has done a wonderful performance, but the best thing about this series is seeing human behavior and despair of not having money to live. We live in a world with money and without it you are nothing, and because of that money we are losing humanity itself, in a world that is increasingly populated and with less work to survive. The numbers don\\'t add up, we\\'ll see what the future holds for everyone due to lack of money.,Well directed, pretty good writing, uneven acting (partly over the top theatrical, partly just as it should be), well produced and shot, keeps viewers\\' attention, slightly predictable at moments (and in general), masterfully edited and with an appropriate music score. As the tile says: good watch (but only once, since then you\\'ll know \"the secret\", and the mystery will be gone forever).,Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2.This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout. Only minus was very bad VIPs acting.,This show was phenomenal. I didn\\'t start watching it for a few weeks after it came out because it didn\\'t seem super interesting. It didn\\'t appeal to me. But then it stayed at #1 on Netflix for over a month, everyone was talking about, and it seemed like the only thing on social media at the time, so I decided to check it out. I speak English, but I wanted to have the true show experience, so I watched it in Korean. I wanted to hear the actors real voices, and it bothers me when the voice doesn\\'t match up with the movement on the screen. Regardless, the Korean actors were great. I don\\'t know how to judge actors when they are speaking Korean, but it seemed really well done. I was skeptical about watching the VIP episode because of what people said about their acting. To be honest, I couldn\\'t figure out what was so bad about it. Sure it wasn\\'t amazing, and they were weird at times, but it wasn\\'t nearly as bad as people said it was. I\\'ve talked about the acting, now I will talk about the show. Hwang Dong-hyuk is a genius. The plot of this show was so unique and so cool to watch. Every game that played was very entertaining to watch, it is hard for me to pick a favorite. I also liked how the show wasn\\'t just these people playing kids games, it actually explored some of the characters lives. I just thought it was cool. Lastly, I loved the characters. All of them were great, but my favorites had to be Gi-hun, Ali, and the Old Man. Their characters were just so likable. Those were just my favorites, there were so many more I liked.If you haven\\'t already, I definitely recommend watching this to anyone, you won\\'t regret it. My recommendation is to watch the snow in Korean, but if you are just looking to relax and not read the subtitles whenever someone talks, watch it in your main language. I really hope there is a season 2, it will be cool to see what they do after the ending.,I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn\\'t leave me satisfied.Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It\\'s very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few \\'\\'wow\\'\\' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren\\'t that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It\\'s not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn\\'t say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don\\'t get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.Overall it\\'s a fun series but don\\'t look to far into it. It\\'s got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that\\'s that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed),Terrific show; a timely watch. While it certainly dabbles in issues regarding social status, I more so saw this show\\'s narrative as a debate on society\\'s morality and compassion. Mixing offbeat scenarios with unyielding brutality, Squid Game shows how desperate, callous and even savage humans can be when the conditions are met and that capitalism serves more as a byproduct of these behaviors. It asks the question: Does humanity still possess any decency in such an oppressed and unforgiving world? Highly recommend it. It\\'s a breath of fresh air for anyone craving something unique. A gripping survival drama full of palpable suspense and sharp commentary.,I\\'m usually not one to instantly check a show out when it\\'s trending, but after seeing so many TikTok videos of people trying to cut perfect shapes out of the famous Dalgona snack cookies with small needles, and seeing how the stakes couldn\\'t get much higher what with those who failed at said task would get killed (which was very jarring), I caved in and decided to see what I was missing. And after episode 9 ended, I want more. Because not only did the hype behind this show click, but it also may be even better than I thought it would already be. And me wanting more isn\\'t me saying that the season was too short or anything, but considering how near flawlessly everything worked here, I\\'ve never been this interested in a show like this in a long time. One of the reasons for this are the characters. They\\'re all so damn good and well written. Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Ali, Il-Nam, Sae-byeok, Jun-ho, and pretty much everyone else are all effective and very likable, even those who took villainous paths (being vague to avoid spoilers). This is emphasized by the performances, as they are absolutely phenomenal, as everyone here kills it. I felt the fear, anger, happiness, sadness, and tiredness from everyone here, making this have some of the best casting I\\'ve seen in a show yet. The story, as well, is superb. To keep it somewhat brief, it\\'s essentially how people who are in massive amounts of debt are taken to a secret island where they must play childhood-like games to win-except, if you lose one of them, you don\\'t just lose the game. You lose your life. At first, that may seem somewhat simple. But the way this show handles it with its excellent pacing, characterization, and world building (all with lots of gore), it works very, very well. It\\'s not only tense, but it\\'s very emotional. And that goes for all 9 episodes here. I was constantly at the edge of my seat. This show is also an excellent parody of capitalism, as it loosely portrays how the top 1% looks down on everyone else, and that even though money is the driving factor for everyone else, it\\'s not necessarily money that makes life better-because the top 1% rot their brains of greed and are actually worse. So much so, that the lives of fellow people who are poor don\\'t matter as much. And I think this show nailed that wonderfully. Overall, the first season is masterfully written, directed, performed, and executed, and I\\'m very excited to see what the inevitable season 2 brings to the table, because so far, this is one of the best shows I\\'ve seen in the past decade, and I hope Hwang Dong-hyuk keeps up the pace, because he did one hell of a job, here.,This is the first Korean web series I\\'ve ever watched in my entire life and I watched it just because everyone were talking about it and everyone were appreciating it and that\\'s why I watched it and believe me, spending my life\\'s almost 9 hours for watching this was worthy. It\\'s really too good and I would say that it\\'s for everyone, I mean it has everything starting from Suspense, thriller, action, blood, comedy, adventure, plot twists, most of all is emotion, horror each and everything and that\\'s what makes this series perfect.,The dose of enthusiasm and suspense is very beautiful .. but the end was supposed to be more beautiful.,This is the first South Korean series I\\'ve ever seen. I really think it\\'s a good one. The concept--similar to that of Hunger Games or Battle Royale, but they play children\\'s games instead--is nothing new. But I really love how it\\'s done.It\\'s not really that scary. But it can be a bit disturbing. That mirror game is the only scary one. Episode 2 is the only one I didn\\'t like much. I also wish the VIPs didn\\'t talk. The acting is great, the characters are believable, making the viewers care for what\\'s going to happen to them.Finale was quite anticlimactic, although I love that twist. It surprised be, to be honest.,Really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. Started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the VIP stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. Has great production values and acting. Episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how Season 2 will turn out.8/10 for Season 1.,A number of excellent films have come out of South Korea over the past decade or so. Now this, a blinder of a TV series. Absolutely fantastic. Was thinking of cancelling Netflix but glad I didn\\'t.,Who needs to watch 455 people being murdered? Some odd messaging on capitalism and income disparity coupled with reality TV game shows. Hey ccool, look the losers don\\'t just fall into a pool then fall into an incinerator. Give it pass.,In spite of the inevitable air of ludicrousness that all overdubbed shows have, this starts really well, with an idea that, if not entirely original, is shockingly and stylishly executed. But after the first ep it quickly sinks into a miasma of pointlessness: you don\\'t care in the slightest about the characters, their sob stories, the reason for their mysterious ordeal, or - especially - the plot contortions needed to get an ongoing series out of what is basically a static situation.For a TV show, though, it certainly has visual flair, with a slew of such futuristic and dystopian influences as Escher, Kubrik. Fritz Lang, Flash Gordon and Tron. As against that, it gets a demerit for the appalling racial stereotype of the Pakistani character. You would never get away with that in an English-language show these days, and rightly so.,Man! This show!Does everything right at the best times. Just when you forget some detail that would make you feel brilliantly smart, it comes back to whack you in the face!Like some of it\\'s contemporaries it brilliantly fuses comedy and horror in the most psychological of way\\'s and I must say, I really want more of this, and more like this.,As survival series go, \"Squid Game\" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a \"Hunger Games\", \"Saw\", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards. The show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator.The stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind. The parts where they delved into the Human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom... This part, more than anything else, made this Korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted.The show came close to relying on clichéd tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow Dong-hyuk Hwang evaded all those loopholes and \\'convenience zones\\'. He also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire.Every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point. Neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline. The thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work.Jaeil Jung\\'s musical scoring more than \\'made it work\\' where this series was concerned. He captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes. That ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often... That never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense.Great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes. These, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on IMDB), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric.A few negatives... There were no cameras in the restrooms. This particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there. No cavity checks of the prisoners - that was another \\'tricky\\' omission. The highly trained guards were otherwise not immediately suspicious when one of their own started to act out of protocol. However, these and a handful of other \\'loopholes\\' were needed to progress the plot and did not feel contrived - emphasis on that word, that\\'s where the magic lay in this series.I highly recommend watching all nine episodes in their original Korean-language (non-dubbed) version. Feel free to rely on subtitles to stay informed. That\\'s how I watched \"Squid Game\" on Netflix. The \\'feel\\' was so much different than when I \\'tested\\' a few minutes of the show in its English dub.Being in debt is no joke, it truly destroys lives and families, even entire friendships and romances. This series captured the sheer helplessness of being in debt, and it did so through its characters. It also captured the depths of human depravity, and what some people with too much money are willing to do.With Netflix\\'s \"Squid Game\" Dong-hyuk Hwang has made a \\'dark\\' mark one won\\'t soon forget. He proved how artfully you can take a cliché, or something familiar, and twist it into something new. \"Squid Game\" had that in abundance, and made me feel like I was watching something genuinely artistic and soulful. The show went deep into the primal nature of Humankind instead of just showcasing our \\'better nature\\'.,There\\'s a lot of hype surrounding this series. I thought it was okay, I almost didn\\'t finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1. The problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable.After fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, I stuck with the show.So the show is visually interesting. I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on \\'kids games\\' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)\\r\\nThere were quite a few irritating characters. Very stereotypical gangster type. You\\'d think if the director was clever, he\\'d have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. But I\\'ll get back to that later.Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. You also learn this \\'game\\' has apparently been happening for decades. Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. Then it just loses steam and gets dumb. The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story. It\\'s so badly handled, you\\'d think you\\'re watching another show.The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can\\'t harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on.The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it\\'s coming. And it doesn\\'t even play out all that well.After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it\\'s a rich person who is bored. What\\'s dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn\\'t know who he was.They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won\\'t talk. I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs.See, so many questions, so many holes. The final ending is also pretty bad. Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending.,The peer pressure made me watch this. I wish this show came out about 10 years ago as some small part was predictable but was I surprised? Oh boy,I definitely was. Don\\'t need a second season, but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies. This was brilliant!,Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2. Really entertaining we were very roped in the whole time! Emotional at times. Check it out!!,Quite a good show starts off quite slow however ur does get better. I found a few parts slow and boring however it does get better. Good story and good characters with a big twist at the end!! Hopefully a 2nd season.,I found the first season of squid game quite good however I believe that it is overhyped and everyone made out it was better than it was. The characters were good and the emotional connections were good aswell.,The description says the players are vying for $45 billion dollars but the amount is really 45 billion Korean won or about $30 million USD.,This was an interesting program but not as great as reviewers are making it sound. This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death. Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash. Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn\\'t exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.,IMO, this is a really well done production. Some aspects get lost in translation (cultural, not language) but it\\'s a well told story, regardless. It\\'s not an original story but a twist on an old classic. What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing. You can\\'t google translate this stuff. It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it\\'s a huge speed bump in the entertainment value. All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves. Well, the ones on screen. The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators.But, what\\'s glaringly obvious is the racial aspect. That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani. But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean. In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western. A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too. So the slurs are intentional. Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement.,And I\\'m hard to please!Being a massive fan of Korean cinema and horror I couldn\\'t help sitting through the first three episodes happily identifying all the obvious influences which were by no means restricted to Korean cinema and horror.So the obvious comparisons with films like Old Boy and the Sympathy with Lady vengeance are there. The deshevilled under class of loan dependent opportunists of Parasite.But then there was the island of the Japanese classic, Battle Royale or the cult British 60\\'s TV series, The Prisoner. Additionally there were the not too subtle pieces of political and social commentary which echoed recent Spanish films, Platform and Cadaver.However, it\\'s no accident that the entire plot of Squid Game revolves around the visually striking staircase that for us art school students of the 90s instantly recognised as the post-modern Memphis style. For me this was a kind nod to the 80s post modernist architectural tradition of borrowing other people\\'s ideas and incorporating it into something new and visually striking.And that\\'s the point at which I stopped caring that Squid Game was in essence a neo-postmodern composite and started enjoying the ride.And what a ride.No spoilers here but suffice to say every episode had me experience the full range of emotions, from dread and anger, sympathy and blood list for revenge, Squid Game is brilliantly crafted.The horror genre nerds might try to dismiss some part of the plot as being derivative, but every one needs to remember that Korean cinema doesn\\'t care about genre.Seriously, take a day off work, order take away food and strap yourself in and watch the whole thing in one day. You won\\'t regret it.,Not me, that\\'s for sure.The first episode was a real slog. We meet a loser and half the episode is beating into our heads he\\'s a loser. We get it. The scene in the underground with the recruiter followed by the birthday with his daughter was plenty of backstory. But no, we get stealing from his mom, failure at the track, encounter with bookies...After that we\\'re introduced a pointless \"game\". Who runs that and to what end? The contestants are unknown so wagering makes no sense. Randomly killing losers makes no sense. Some kind of government thing makes no sense. Gladiator stories like Hunger Games or the Maze series work because the heroes are chosen for their skills. These people were chosen for their lack of skill. Huh?The acting is amateur at best. There isn\\'t one likable character. The ending was shoehorned in to allow for an unexpected season 2.This is so far from watchable for me on so many levels I can only assume I\\'m not the intended audience. I give it 0 stars, everyone else seems to give it 10. Call it five stars.,What a beautiful surprise we got here, Netflix usually makes cheap content, like in budget and in creativity, but this is one of the few great things Netflix release per year, like The OA or La casa de papel, Ozark etc.The quality of the script is top pitch perfect, as the characters construction, absolutely great games, very unpredictable, and the teams are more like a chess game, it doesn\\'t matter if u have the strongest team in a tug of war, if u have a genius, an old wise man, fearless integrants, you can rock the way out of any situation, this show grew on me, I LOVED IT.,This show\\'s massive popularity, especially among young Netflix viewers, conveniently exposes that audience to the kind of childhood they had all missed out on - playing games outdoors with other neighborhood kids instead of just sitting on the couch watching Netflix. It is pretty clever in that way, yet that is just the beginning, as this show\\'s multi-layered subject matter and plot line are executed so well that \"Squid Game\" guarantees you to be on the edge of your seat. There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch. \"Squid Game\" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like \"Pulp Fiction,\" and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time. With \"Squid Game,\" you will not be wasting time. I guarantee it.,Episode 1 was AMAZING!!!But things went downhill a little bit each episode. By episode 4, I was totally over it.I did watch all 9 episodes, because I\\'d already invested so much time into it. Plus, I wanted to see what all the social media hype was about...unfortunately, after all 9 episodes, I\\'m not seeing it.Didn\\'t really need to be 9 hours long...would of worked better as one regular 90-minute film.,If you watched any of the most recent dystopian movie likes Hunger Games then you can pretty much figure out that no one is going to win in this. It is made clear that there is only going to be one winner so all the supposed teams are going to end badly so the friendships made are for the sole purpose of making the audience feel something. It kinda does work but it makes you feel manipulated at the same time.This is not a bad show and I can see why people like it. It has all parts to a great Netflix Original but I just felt manipulated while watching it.,Squid Game is a South Korean series on Netflix that blew up recently and got on my radar. Didn\\'t watch any trailers or read any reviews, all I knew was that it was about some \"Game\" and thought it might be like those Japanese game shows or maybe kinda like Wipeout but with a story. That didn\\'t exactly turn out to be the case and I was hooked quickly during the first episode. The series is about a bunch of people knee-deep in troubles joining a game where they compete for a massive cash prize where the penalty for failure is extreme.Boasting multiple characters that you get to know over the course of the season, all backed up by wonderful performances from the cast, getting invested in the story comes easy. They are a varied bunch and the way the series is directed and paced, you pretty much feel as if you\\'re going through this ordeal alongside them. The psychological manipulation that the organization has set up for them and trying to see what you would have done in the situation only adds to the entertainment.I loved how the creator of the series took mostly common games that a lot of us probably have played sometimes in our childhoods and turned them macabre. With good direction and well-paced flow, the tension was often racked up to a great degree and the more you get attached to certain characters, the more intense it got, sometimes being outright brutal and gut-wrenching (I\\'m looking at you Episode 6). The games never got boring nor did they get repetitive as there would mostly be some twists and turns added into the mix.It also doesn\\'t hurt the experience that this feels like a big production and not what you\\'d expect from a \"Game\" series. Apart from a few shoddy CGI shots which can easily be dismissed, most of it looked and sounded great.However, the series does falter a bit in the second half where, for spoilers sake, let\\'s just say some things get revealed and they are what you\\'d boringly expect and probably have predicted early on. On top of that, the performances in that chunk, especially relative to the performances from the rest of the cast, just weren\\'t good. Would have wished they kept things in the dark more, keep the air of mystery or have a bit more meat. Good thing it doesn\\'t ruin the series nor does it impact the overall story a great deal which does end on a high note with social commentary and messaging that one can enjoy.Overall, props to Hwang Dong-hyuk, the Writer and Director, who after a long journey of being rejected by so many areas finally got to make his series and it\\'s heartwarming to see it get so popular and receive praise and his hard work pay off immensely, so Never Give Up I guess. Unless you\\'re squeamish and can\\'t handle rough stuff, I\\'d highly recommend this series to everyone, but chances are you have already seen it. Had a great time with it. Wherever they decide to take the story next, I\\'ll certainly am looking forward to it. And if I were to rate it, I\\'d give it an 8.5/10.,The show has an interesting storyline - you can draw various metaphors (about society, capitalism) if you want to, or simply watch something with a different concept. The writing does enough to make you care about the characters.The acting was brilliant overall! Camera work, color correction/editing & set design were AMAZING and the music was great.All that said, I don\\'t think it\\'s mind blowing. Parts of the show that others LOUVE you may just like or you won\\'t mind. Don\\'t let that get in the way of your decision to watch the show or not. I think you should not miss out on it. The show is also brutal, dark and might be disturbing but still very entertaining.,I heard so much hype for this so I was excited to watch. I did enjoy the first episodes a lot and was really positively surprised with diverse characters like Ali and Sae Byeok. I wish we got more depth to her and surely she would have had very interesting background/flashbacks. I wish there had been more winners honestly, cos i thought multiple winners were possible. The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche.,I only started watching because it pretty much blew up on the internet and it got me curious, and wow. I really didn\\'t expect much from this but I was proven wrong really quickly. The basis of this show is something we\\'re all familiar with: wealth inequality and the lines people are forced to and will cross for money, and it was the literal version of \\'a rich man\\'s playground\\'. The poor were just things for him to play with, for some fun and excitement. Anyway, the range of emotions I felt while watching the episodes was enough to leave me somewhat exhausted, but in a good way. Really, I gotta hand it to the team that worked on this because it was clearly a high budget and high quality production. Also, I know it\\'s pretty rare for Korean shows to have more than 1 season, but that ending was hinting at a 2nd season, wasn\\'t it?,While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don\\'t expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga \"Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji\", which has been running from 1996. It\\'s been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing \"Squid Game\".The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this \"inspiration\".There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. \"Squid Game\" definitely satisfies in this department, although it\\'s not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong\\'s \"Burning\" (2018) or the Oscar-winning \"Parasite\". But the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if Bong Joon-ho would do a superhero movie called \"The Vengeancers\".,The Good:I don\\'t give 10s out lightly. Squid Game deserves this score because there is NOTHING else that came out in 2021 that became a cultural phenomenon like this one. No astroturfing, no manufactured hype. A genuine global phenomenon that emerged organically. How about that?Squid Game is television at its absolutely finest. I can\\'t tell you the last time I was immediately transfixed by a show and captivated from beginning to end. Where do I even start with this?The incredible characters, who are more human and realistic than 99% of the people we ever see on screen? The incredible layered writing that gives each person such depth and complexity? The performances, which are so powerful and excellent, that the cast became overnight global celebrities? The pacing of the show which - save for episode 8 - is basically perfect? The twists and turns, shocking reveals and incredible easter eggs layered throughout? The tension generated from a brutal, misanthropic world that nevertheless has a twisted sense of morality and fairness? The iconic visuals? The set and costume design that keeps these images in your head long after you\\'ve seen the show?The exciting, diverse and incredible set pieces? How an episode about marbles - literally the least visually compelling game in the series - is universally declared one of the best episodes of television ever produced? Or how the first game grabs you and immediately sums up the ethos of the entire show?What about the heavy themes, which delve deep into explorations of human nature, greed, solidarity; that reflect contemporary anxieties about income inequality in South Korea (and increasingly, the world)? Hell, this and Parasite have solidified South Korea as a cultural superpower and honestly, if I were Korean, I would be extremely proud. The Korean Wave is going to be a tsunami.I can go on and on about what this show does well: how you can spend hours dissecting it, how it balances extremely dark and sadistic subject matter with humanity, tenderness and humour, how it subverts expectations the RIGHT WAY. It\\'s a 10.The Bad: Perfection doesn\\'t truly exist. And if I wanted to really pick out a flaw, it\\'s Episodes 7 and 8. I\\'ll touch on the VIPs after, but all-in-all, Episode 7 is still a great episode. It just adds some elements (like narration), that I didn\\'t see as necessary. Episode 8 is an emotional wrecking ball, but it\\'s weirdly short and kind of out of place.The Ugly: Okay, so the major criticism I\\'ve been seeing has been the performances and dialog of the VIPs. Notwithstanding the difficulty of finding fluent, non-Korean English speakers in South Korea, directing them (whilst not speaking the same language) and writing English dialog as a non-English speaker, the VIPs are highly intentional.Squid Game does not portray the wealthy upper class as an elite group of hyper sophisticated, intelligent people. This is probably a more realistic depiction: they\\'re crude, callous, cringe inducing and save for their wealth, pathetic people. The casting of Gong Yoo and Lee Byung-Hun - who are basically Brad Pitt/Leo DiCaprio levels of famous in South Korea - was meant to imply that the wealthy retain these handsome, sophisticated men to project an elite status. But it doesn\\'t exist. In reality, these are just douchebags.That the mind behind all of this is, well, the last person you\\'d expect, but in reality, would be the MOST LIKELY to do something like this, drives this point home even more.In summation. Either you\\'ve watched Squid Game or not at this point. It\\'s a masterpiece. It\\'s the best content I\\'ve seen all year. Just watch it and make up your own mind.,When I first heard about Squid Game I thought it was really out there. After watching it, I still have that belief. I like the premise of Squid Game, and I think most of the show is pretty good. The games are fun, you learn to care about the players, and the setting is eerie. I did not really understand the whole organ harvesting side plot, and it seemed unnecessary. The twist at the end was pretty good, but relating everything back to betting on horses was not a good comparison. I\\'m excited to see if this show will return for another season.,Long time viewer of both Netflix and K-dramas, and this one is a fantastic blend of the best of both. The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.For those who are complaining about the VIP\\'s: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?,As far as I get this it\\'s an amazing concept of mixing real lives and childhood games. So, excited about the 2nd season of this. All the best. Thank you.,Well, before everybody was not talking about, I started to watch, it is different but I really don\\'t understand why this happened so popular in everywhere. I watched better things from Korea. It is nice and different, simple games, good characterizations but for me there is a logical error, everybody hasn\\'t equal standards in the game and we cannot talk about equality or justice. In an episode there was a dialog about that.. Anyway, it is nice and watchable.,Strength, agility, cunning and dexterity nothing count in Squid Game, the value of human life is practically zero.Even luck doesn\\'t count for anything.You compete in the game with \\'\\' free will \\'\\' even if in a society where resources are controlled by a few and most people need resources to be fulfilled, free will is just a chimera.The main flaw that I noticed in the nine episodes is the predictability, you immediately understand who the protagonists are and they will go on in the rehearsals and in the episodes and vice versa you immediately understand who is part of the extras and their life will last very little, not only because extras do not have any kind of background but also from the visual frames reserved for them very approximate compared to the protagonists.For a series like this there had to be at least 20 other main actors where every time they \\'\\' disappeared \\'\\' they gave an emotional effect to the viewer.,Can\\'t say that I saw many Korean movies but on occasion they certainly produce a special and unique pieces of cinema that deserve attention of everyone.First I want to say that I didn\\'t like the main protagonist. His gambling addiction really puts you off. As the series progress you see his better qualities which make you sympathize, but still he thought he was cunning the old man in the 4th game.I felt sorry for good hearted Ali, who wasn\\'t that smart and was completely and absolutely loyal to the end.It made very little sense to me how the bodies sbaching operation could be done under the nose of a front man and at the same time involve a lot people from the staff. Such operation could not become unnoticed.I\\'ve noticed the cop\\'s phone was about 60% charged at the beginning, so hiw did ge kept his battery until the end?The old man\\'s identity was known to middle staff (soldiers), which didn\\'t made much sense.In any case it\\'s a good one and worth to check out.,Absolutely fabulous! Truly fabulous. I was terribly bummed to read so many reviews that claim the subtitle translation was bad; as an English-only speaker, proper translations are paramount. I never watch English language dubs as they are horrible compared to watching (and hearing real characters voicing their parts) in the original language with the subtitles on.In all honesty, this likely would have been a \\'10\\' had it not been for some slow areas in episodes 1, 2, & 9. That\\'s not to say that they were bad, but there is a necessity for backstory that is handled in these episodes (or post-story, re: ep9) and to me there were some wasted opportunities. Nonetheless, the show is definitely binge worthy. I went through it in two days and am hopeful they\\'ll do another season.Extremely well produced, a super cool mix of fantasy, action, and drama with a novel story line. But hey...what\\'s up with Lee Byung-hun not being credited in IMDB for his cameo as The Frontman? I get that the \"walking around\" character didn\\'t need to be Byung-hun, but it was such a surprise to see his face behind the mask that he needs to be credited.,Nothing new here but it\\'s quite well done and engaging. There\\'s more story and character development than you might expect from this story and that keeps it from just being generic. As with many shows, the English dubbing is bad: if recommend original Korean with subtitles. One nice thing is that because this is a series and not a movie, they\\'re able to dig into the backstories more and that makes it more engaging and interesting than this may have otherwise been. A great addition to the genre.,Squid game feels like it\\'s a mixture of the game show Takeshi\\'s Castle, and the films Hunger Games, and Battle Royale!A bunch of people down on their luck playing a number of childrens games for the chance to win a large sum of money. Sounds very basic but the series is anything but, there are twists and turns all the way through, and the penalty for losing a game is....severe.There are a number of sub plots, and whilst some of those events are slightly predictable, the vast majority are not. Squid Game is like Game of Thrones in that no matter which characters you like, it\\'s probable that they aren\\'t going to make it to the end alive.The series maintains a high level of intrigue and tension throughout as you eagerly wait to find out what the next challenge is, and learn more about the operation behind the games. It is highly stylised and quite a few of the scenes come across as they\\'ve been taken straight out the pages of a graphic novel...all this means is that it looks great!Situations bring out the worst in people mostly, but also sometimes the best in people, as characters choose to work together or betray each other to make it to the end. Sometimes you don\\'t want to watch, but somehow you can\\'t look away.The climax was quite satisfying if not perfect, and it leaves the series open to a second season....can\\'t wait!,Violent and imaginative, the SG is fun to watch.People struggle with money and get a chance to play kids games turned deadly in a misterious place were everyone wears masks. Ruthless, people start to die in each game until one is left. Wich one?,This show hooks you in from the start!!!! It makes you care about these characters and you form an attachment to them!!! The message and theme of this show is so powerful and relevant. I love this show so much!!,An outstanding piece of Korean Television drama. If you can see it with the subtitles and not the dubbed version, do so. As others have said the dubbed version is atrocious.This literally is as I have described above. A motley group of Koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death.Nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part. What do they all have in common? Poverty or huge debts or both. The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there\\'s various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face. (One man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)There are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals.I don\\'t want to say more for fear of spoilers. Definitely worth your time.,I binge-watched this one. Every episode was so addictive and tense.All episodes were very emotionnal. Then we reached the conclusion and.... what a letdown. Huge anti-climatic ending.I would still recommend watching it.,Watched the whole thing in a day after hearing bout it from others and some guy going its way way way out there the games like I would never have seen before!? SO NOT TRUE the plot story even plant was all Very predictable and we\\'ve seen these escape death tournaments a hundred times before usually in a just movie length and with bigger faster action so really this should just be youre average 5 but I gave a extra point as the actors are good . And it does do as a good enough past time. Its just not something that needed to be a series.,Watch the first episode if you can\\'t resist the marketing hype. You\\'ll see it\\'s a 3/4. But since these few points - due to the fresh storyline - are undeserved (it\\'s heavily inspired by the manga-anime Kaiji, and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies), I\\'ll give it a 1.Abysmal overacting, puppet characters, unrealistic and unrefined stuff. Even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it\\'s trash.,Thrilling, astonishing and deceptive at the same time. Shockingly violent and discomforting but lacks of strength in the end.,Everyone is talking about squid game so I will give it a go...turns out the plot is right up my street! Korean children\\'s games where if they lose they die! Really original and fresh.Ep1 - you see most of this in the trailer but it really is one of the best episodes. Red light green light iconic.Ep2 - bit slow but building towards something\\r\\nEp3 - honeycomb ep really good\\r\\nEp4 - allegiances form and tug of war\\r\\nEp5 - didn\\'t really enjoy the harvesting organs doctor plot\\r\\nEp 6 -gganbu ep big names die in this and it\\'s really coming towards the end now!Ep7 - glass bridge ep really good and lots more big names die\\r\\nEp8 - short ep where it leads to the crescendo in ep 9 where main character ends up winning however some of his choices are frustrating. For example not trying to win the game at the end and also when he does win doesn\\'t make the most of the money. It finally looks as if he is going sorting his life out and then he doesn\\'t get on the plane!!! (And for some reason decided to get a really strange haircut which doesn\\'t really suit him!)So much potential and I really hope there\\'s a series two!,Series are wonderful ones to watch because they sow curious elements into the mind of the audience when they finish the episodes one by one. There was something striking in each episode that urges the viewers to go for the next one. Squid Game is similar to that, it is like a typical Web/TV series that has that flavor in every episode. I\\'m an ardent fan of Korean movies because of the way of representation and the choosing of subjects they are portraying. Squid Game is the first Korean series I am watching that also provides that kind of Korean fragrance. It\\'s about games not only one game but also the children\\'s game popular among in Korea. The basic core of the movie is the need for money and the problems and struggles followed by the low-class section of the Korean community. The series gets more engaged when the contestants participate in the game. And the game is something like a survival one because those who failed in the game will be killed. It is a do-or-die action for them. Initially, there were 456 contestants and when the game progresses the number gets decreased and the amount in the piggy bank becomes increases. When the last man survives he gets an amount of 45.6 billion won as a reward. This might be the capsule plot behind Squid Game. There might arise a lot of questions regarding this capsule plot. Who conducts these survival games? What did they get while conducting these games? Is it legal or illegal? Like this, you\\'ll have many more doubts and questions regarding Squid Game. If you watched the series you\\'ll have that clear answer with you and if you are not watched it yet then go and watch this wonderful series. You\\'ll surely get engaged.,This might be the first major injection of Battle Royale style stories into mass media ... I think what differentiates Squid Game from other similar shows is that characters are mostly poor people with massive debts, just like most of the world I guess, unlike school kids in Battle Royale or Student aged kids in Alice in Borderland or a gaming nerd in Btoom ... The show is properly high budget , the acting is decent and the script is good, what makes the show appeal to masses, just like Lost when it came out, not many realized it\\'s a rehashed for masses Earth 2.,I can see why so many people like this series. Although I gave up on it at the start of episode 2 I can see that it exudes quality. It does so many of the things well that you expect from Korean drama, most particularly the actors delivering their roles with absolute conviction.But, for me at least, the story line is too dark, the view of the human condition too bleak, for this to be an entertainment. Korea does so many uplifting dramas, romantic comedies and moving tragedies for me to avoid watching those for any longer than I have to.,Show was lame, very weirdly paced and slow. It wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee. Dont follow the hype either. Idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there. Alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense. You dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show. This show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as BR. Skip this or watch if your bored.,This is a modernized version of the disintegration of people in front of audiences that has attracted people\\'s attention since Roman times. Games are simple children\\'s games. Players are people struggling in financial grip and unable to find a way out. Prize money awarded to the winner makes the man skip a few classes. In the first stage, 456 people are invited to the game. We focus on 8 of them. The remaining 448 people will die simply extras. 5 of these 8 people are doing tricks to win the money.Even if we accept the logic of the script itself, allowing people to kill each other when the game is not being played. Ignoring people even if they have illegal things on them. Freeing cheating. Employees being blunt and telling every secret, the nation\\'s organ trade inside and not being caught in such a technological place, not smelling cigarettes, etc. Etc.The series continued with curiosity until the last episode. The last episode dropped the whole mode and evolved into a more ridiculous ending. What they thought they were supposedly hiding was evident in the 6th episode. It would be a surprise if it wasn\\'t.The series seemed to me as a combination of movies such as (see: 13 tzameti), (see: das experiment), (see: the belko experiment).,With all the hype around it I was very interested in this series, but found myself somewhat disappointed. Yes, it is interesting enough to keep watching, but actually it is not that special. Yes there are some interesting plot twists but again, not really shocking. It is all a basic conflict of bonding with people that all go for the money, where apparently our hero is the only one with some moral feelings. The storyline with the detective did not add much and the VIPs were silly. The gangster is very stereotype and silly.There is a uprising in Korean series, this one is ok, but not special. \"Memories of the Alhambra\" and \"Sysiphus\" are much more intelligent in their script.,Can Watchable in One Sitting , Binge Worthy Show from Netflix.,I watched Episode 1 on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series, and they were absolutely right. I was captured right away. The series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing. Beware, cause there is more than enough violence in the series, and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters, at the same time that you despise others. Keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events. You probably won\\'t see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often. The best thing about this series is the acting. My mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances. There are true Emmy or Oscar level performances throughout the show. One of the best series I\\'ve watched in a long time.,This is a great show at first i thought \"Squid Game\" what a awful name but i got tons of good recommendations to watch it so i did and it was GREAT!!! Acting was good and the plot wad always aligned you can pretty much but two and two together towards the end if your smart but for most who can your in for a big surprise anyway good show. I recommend all to watch this masterpiece.,I had a problem to stay with the show in multiple episodes where the tempo suddenly changes and it becomes rather uneventful, predictable and boring. I know, it tries to bring in some emotional moments (sometimes successfully ).Korean acting style is often over the top, but in this series it fits in as it should bring out the stressful environment. Still, sometimes annoying.Overall I liked it, but mostly I just wanted to know what happens next regardless of the actors or performances. Events in the plot are more significant than anything else. I am glad I avoided any spoilers before watching this, otherwise I think I would just quit mid episode 1.,This series has many of the elements that made Saw and The Hunger Games great, with enough unique iconic elements to earn its place as an instant classic in its own right. It makes you care about its rich, developing characters, played by charismatic and convincing actors. It masterfully balances extreme suspense with gruesome outcomes, but it also sneaks in endearing and comedic scenes when you least expect it. It makes insightful social commentary about subjects such as extreme financial disparities. It addresses depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. It features creative set design, props, costumes, and music that have already become the inspiration for countless memes. It will spur various conversations with your friends about all of these subjects and more.,The inclusion of the cheesy acting and writing in the VIP segment in the middle of so much quality work was the koreans trying to broaden american interest by recreating the cheesy acting and writing usually popular in american action movies...,Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children\\'s games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake.Season 1 : 9 episodesTop series for this year by far , the Idea💡 , the execution of the story 👏 , it shows how far need can take you and how greedy humans can be .My rating : 9/10 , IMDB : 8.2/10.,This will be your thorough start-to-end review. I am going to mention that this series got right, and everything it got wrong. I am rating it a 5 overall. It\\'s a solid 8 for the first 5 episodes, and just ONE star for the remaining episodes. You\\'ll understand why.And in advance, excuse me for my not-so-good English. (Im not native).Overview:\\r\\nThis series was a risk to take, the director knows that very well. It\\'s very bloody, and the centerpiece of the plot deals with a rather sensitive idea. It was no problem because it was handled as it should be, not perfectly but, it was good and enjoyable, until it started falling apart and the bad outweighed the good.The Good:\\r\\nThe idea is great. If you have watched this series, you must have a faint idea about why this had so much buzz in such a short time. The whole concept of \"Hunger Games\" style, being played by the wealthy but not forced to do so, as well as the kids\\' game as their theme, did pretty well in the first episodes. It was fair, square, and it lived up to its own concept.There were stereotypical characters, and others really well-written, the entire cast is great, memorable, and there are characters who you would root for. All characters had a common thing between them, financial misery, and that money can solve all problems, yet they had some depth to them. It\\'s not the best character writing but it sure did the job.The atmosphere was so great during the first 5 episodes, you can actually LIVE in the shoes of the characters, you can see what they see, you can feel it, you start actually relating to them. It\\'s all great, it\\'s what the series is meant to do.The acting for most characters was great, the dialogue is smart (I watched it in fan-subs, as the original subs didn\\'t do it for me).The Bad:\\r\\nThe main character is kind of \"stale\" to me, it\\'s not really someone I\\'d care about, he is a loser, and he is set out to be one all the series but he ends up winning just like that, he gets this psychological breakdown after he wins, but it just feels so not right. The main character is just wrong. I am pretty sure everyone shares the same opinion. It\\'s not about the actor, but the director didn\\'t really get so clever about managing his MC\\'s façade it felt flat.It becomes predictable towards EP 6: You start wishing something unpredictable happens. Most characters just die during the 4th and 5th game, and there\\'s not much to see after that.It deviates from its concept: Kids game, right? That\\'s what made the first 4 games great, as soon as they deviated from that logic, it started feeling like a different series, ones we didn\\'t sign up for, nor did we want.The Ugly:\\r\\nRemember the policeman who played spy to look for his brother? Such a really long side-plot for what? We watched him infiltrate the island but for what? He gets shot off by his own brother, nothing happens afterwards. We sure haven\\'t seen him die but something about the entire side plot should\\'ve happened during the first season because it took a lot of screentime of the FIRST season. Simply leaving it for a second season after it took so much time from the first season is just ridiculous and kind of greedy. Also, being shot by his own brother is really cliché.VIPs: This is a grand \"kek\", they were just very bad and a pain to watch. Nothing about them really adds anything to the series, they had so much potential, and the air of mystery about them faded away poorly as soon as they started talking nonsense. I get the director wanted us to hate them, but this bittered the drinkNothing gets resolved: This is the big downside of the entire series: So WHAT. They want to enforce the fact the money doesn\\'t buy happiness, it does buy happiness. But that\\'s not the point, because the contestants CHOSE to partake in the blood fest. Yet somehow the MC kept whining and whining seeing people die. What the hell? You signed up for it, you get what you wished for, lolz.Last game is a buzzkill: They should\\'ve come up with a better 1 on 1 game. It was already a big let-down when they killed off the girl like that, but seriously? Suicide? After all he went through ? So freaking stupid.The last 3 episodes just killed a lot of braincells in my head. It felt like the director and the writers just turned the switch of thinking in their brain OFF. I couldn\\'t help but feel so bad for not just skipping to the end of the last episode.All in all, it was fun to start with, and kind of an ultimate disappointment in the end. But it\\'s still good, totally worth your time but no way in hell does it come close to the best 100 series ever.,This one isn\\'t popular because it\\'s groundbreaking or going where television hasn\\'t been before, but because of the story it\\'s telling. Korean television/cinema has had a big boom among Western audiences in the last few years and I\\'m glad to see it because they do create wonderful media and are excellent storytellers. Squid Game, however, isn\\'t any different from what the Japanese offered us through Battle Royale some decades prior but given the current socio/political climate we\\'re living in, this show was released at just the right time.Ultimately, it\\'s a critique on capitalism and how it dehumanizes people. We see how far a person will go just to have a fat wallet. I think the show does a good job at tackling this topic by showing the negative effects this greed has on people. We see how some working class people get lost in their pursuit of insane wealth to the point of financial ruin and how some of the wealthy elite have so much money than they know what to do with so they decide to bet on working class people like one would do on horses - a comparison that is made in the show.The characters we follow who join the games are all in financial ruin and desperately need money to pay off their debts. The first episode gives us the backstory of the main protagonist, Gi-Hun and the second one gives us glimpses into the lives of the other main characters whom the show will focus on as the games progress. The initial antagonist character among them, the gangster guy, is your stereotypical bad guy. Bullying everyone in the facility, cheating, beating a guy to death - he meets all the \"bad guy is bad\" stereotypes. Our protagonist isn\\'t perfect but he has a good heart and seems to be one of only a few who has a decent moral compass. The latter being debatable with the choice he makes at the end, but we\\'ll get there in a moment.The way each episode is written, you know that Gi-Hun is going to end up winning the game no matter what. Although this irritated me a bit because of how predictable it was, they do manage to hit with shocks and surprises despite the obvious outcome. Since there are various main characters we were following, you begin to root for several of them, most notably Sae-Byeok, Ali, and Player 001. So when these characters lose the game, it does have an emotional impact to those who get invested in the story which seems to be everyone, really. In that respect, the show succeeds at making people feel something and at times left in shock despite how predictable. An interesting balance to strike but Squid Game does it. I don\\'t think anything sets the viewer up for the big plot twist at the end, sadly I was expecting it because it got spoiled for me - it\\'s hard not to have this show spoiled with how popular it is on social media. However, it is quite a big twist that actually really brings the critique at the center of this story home.Now my issues with this show have to do with it\\'s B plot and the awful VIP\\'s that were introduced near the end of the games. The B plot is that of a detective that sneaks his way onto the boat when the players decide to return and continue playing the game. He makes it pretty far in his mission to investigate and expose these sadistic games but the climax for this plot is very underwhelming. I guess the game master or head henchman turns out to be the detective\\'s brother and this revelation is what makes the detective give up, so he lets himself be shot and killed. Maybe they were trying to accomplish something with this plot, this one did manage to keep me in suspense and the ending upset me - while the predictable main plot kept me in some suspense but really got me with its ending. I suppose I\\'ll be further unpacking that one. It might not be that deep though and just be speedy storytelling when it comes to the B plot.Now for the complaint that seems to be everyone else\\'s, the awful VIP\\'s. I wouldn\\'t have an issue with the appearance of these characters if it wasn\\'t for the horrid way they were acted out. The voices were too irritating to hear, every time they came out and spoke, I felt like the minutes dragged on. The dialogue for them was awful too. Now it\\'s possible it was written by someone who\\'s first language isn\\'t English, but the actors (who I assume are native English speakers) couldn\\'t pitch in and amend that ? Well what can you expect from them when the acting was atrocious. I read online that the actors were asked to perform this way but intentional as it may be, it was irritating and really dragged down the show in my opinion. They were a cheesy addition to the show. I get they\\'re necessary to the plot, but had they been performed differently, in a less \"1960\\'s cartoon villain\" way then they would\\'ve been on par with the rest of the show. I think speaking in normal voices and saying sentences that normal people say, would\\'ve made it much more sadistic. I mean that\\'s the theme throughout the show.All in all, I enjoyed the series. I wasn\\'t fond with the ending showing the character deciding to go back and expose the game, instead of going to see his kid - and he\\'s the hero we were supposed to root for ? Guess that\\'s to set us up for season 2, but I think this show works better if there\\'s new characters each season and if they must bring back the main character, he could come back after taking care of important things. Still, I will definitely be watching season 2 when it\\'s available. Believe it or not I\\'m actually happy this is as popular as it is, it means people are becoming more aware of the reality we\\'re living in.,If you haven\\'t seen Battle Royale, Gantz, As the Gods Will, Alice in Borderland and other japanese series, you will be amazed. I only watched with pain the 1st episode. It went slowly to the good part and I will continue watching. But it doesn\\'t deserve the credit of its predecessors and whatever comes in next episodes will not make me change my mind.,Squid Game is a South Korean survival drama. I started watching the series after seeing the trailer thinking of it as a cool fun adventure thriller, instead, it turned out to be more of a hard-hitting human story. It has so much depth for a survival series genre which is mainly known for brutality and gore, which it has in plenty, but also adds to it with the writing having heart-wrangling social commentary.The writing and direction are class, the casting spot on, the music, set pieces as well as camera angle really add to the thrill. The only complaint I have is, it was two episodes too long, dragged in the middle.,Man who made this and this is so emotional when grandpa knew he was cheating but gave it all up saying ganbu buddies stay and share together and so was ali who paid a price for his innocence.I wished like every show the good guys has a chance but no this one is realistic as hell.On episode 6 made me cry i miss my dad seeing gramps .Bruh they got me in the first half I\\'m not gonna spoil the spoiler but I did cry for nothing.,After finishing the show today (I braced myself not to watch it all in one sitting) and without reading spoilers (but recognising many of the hints), I think this show is liked and disliked for the wrong reasons by many.I don\\'t know what Koreans think of the show, but have quite a few Asian friends who liked it. It\\'s always been a bit funny to me, because most Asians I know NEVER seem interested in their continents movies or shows and prefer Hollywood.Personally, I think Hollywood is about as bad as it can be (at least I hope it can\\'t get even worse) and there\\'s almost nothing for me.Since the late 90s, Japan and Korea (also Brazil and Mexico) have done quite a few amazing movies.Korea with Brotherhood, OldBoy, the brilliant Shiri/Swiri, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and the very twisty \"The Wailing\" (Squid Game reminded me of that, although they are about different topics),\\r\\nJapan with gems like Swallowtail Butterfly, Love Exposure, Confessions, to name only a few.Many of the mediocre or bad reviews complain about things that show that they never watched Asian movies and can\\'t seem to get into the culture.One example is the character of Min-Yeo.Sure, on the surface, she\\'s a manipulative lady, seemingly just cruel and selfish. But I was rather shocked to see how many people consider her to be just as bad as the gangster.The actress gave an interview and said she actually felt very bad for her character and that her character, though nasty and feisty is actually just very afraid and alone. We can see that in her own way, how she wants to \"belong\". Think how she learned to use her body or anything to \"entice\" men. Such behavior is usually learned from a traumatic childhood. I really would have loved to know her backstory and hope we will get to know more about her in season 2.I actually didn\\'t hate ANY of the characters. Many said they couldn\\'t sympathize or like any of the characters, but I didn\\'t feel that way. Good or bad, they all had their two sides. The only exceptions are probably Daek-Su and the VIPs, but they are that way for a reason. Heck, there were times in the beginning when I even felt a little bad for Daek-Su.I think Squid Game is trying to show us that we are all neither good or bad people by nature. It\\'s our actions that make us either good or bad.Comparisons to movies like the Hunger Games (yuk!) or Battle Royale don\\'t seem very fitting. One reviewer mentions Oldboy, but I don\\'t see that either. Oldboy and the trilogy around it is about revenge. Squid Game is NOT about revenge. It\\'s more about human nature and how chasing after money is not fulfilling and that money does NOT bring us happiness.Don\\'t you think most of these characters would gladly forfeit all that money if they could bring back the people they lost? Our hero sure doesn\\'t seem happy about his winnings.And Battle Royale... it\\'s similar in a sense that it pits everyone vs everyone, but it\\'s all about punishment. Squid Game isn\\'t about punishment either. Nobody is forced to participate. Heck, even before they cross the glass bridge or any other game, the players ALWAYS have the option to call it quits. It\\'s their greed or desperation that keeps them going. And in some cases, their lack of perspective.Although the big twists are not really a surprise if you watch out for some hints that give them away, I think this has been a very good show. I think the reason it\\'s been so successful is that although it is almost \"normal\" for Korean or Asian movies to \"not end happy\", Western audiences aren\\'t used to it. Surely had this been an American show, the hero wouldn\\'t have learned anything and just spent the money and have a sugary happy ending.The fact that it doesn\\'t end in such a \"perfect\" (and thus unnatural) way is why I like Asian storytelling more. It\\'s just more like actual life.,One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is \"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children\\'s games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake\". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?Firstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.I also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.Another reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother\\'s card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.Unfortunately, the same can\\'t be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don\\'t feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game.Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.,I\\'ve watched the whole lot and it\\'s just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don\\'t know why I watched it all. I\\'m sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It\\'s really woeful.,A nice drama but with bad unrealistic endings in the last 2/9 episodes. The VIPs are rotten wasting stories!The starting is smooth nice to the middle but as it get long, it became average interesting only. If they did not conclude so so simply made endings, I will give 9/10. I can only give 8/10 which is considered good to watch. Furthermore, it\\'s only 9 episodes so luckily not a long drama because the last 2 episodes were too awfully produced.,It\\'s really not that good, highly predictable and the ending was terrible.I will say though, the main character and his acting wasn\\'t too bad, enjoyed watching him, but other than that, it\\'s a waste of time.Anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series.,First of, I am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-English movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world.The concept of Squid Game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives.The main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no VFX are used and the sets were actually built.It starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there\\'s some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds.As we get to the finale however that\\'s a different story, not only it\\'s an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn\\'t make much sense based on the previous events..Without giving any spoilers, the main twist it\\'s not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show.Also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds.Still I did enjoy it for the most part, I don\\'t think it\\'s overhyped, they could\\'ve made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless.,I liked it but the last few episodes were too slow so I had to watch them at 1.5X speed. All in all, it is an odd and entertaining series nicely designed but not as unique as some claim. I do not know if the actors were poorly directed, if they are bad at acting or if it is a cultural thing but I thought many of the characters were overacting.If you have seen The Hostel franchise, Funhouse, The Maze Runner, Battle Royale, the Saw franchise, you will recognize a lot in this series. However, Squid Game stands out with its colorful design and imaginative theme and I liked it. Definitely worth a shot.,If you\\'ve already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you\\'re gonna be disappointed.The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising.And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas....\\r\\nThe plot with the VIP was already seen many times and it felt awkward and ridiculous. And the rest was over dramatic and the \"plot twists\"/reveals so typical...\\r\\nI felt like I\\'ve wasted my time with this series....,\"Squid Game Dethroned In Netflix\\'s Top 10 List By A New Show\" It should have never reached the top 10 list in the first place! The show sucks! Two episodes of this silliness and I was done!,Was curious to what the hype at office was over this series. Now I understand. I agree with reviewer, rubberduckydca, to save myself the need to echo the exact same sentiments and more. Holy molly, Hollywood, watch out. Great entertainment, though, a tat bit blood curling disturbing.,The middle of the season is gripping and exciting without being a cheesy horror series. That said, the beginning drags on a bit and I was looking at my phone at times waiting for it to get good.And the ending was nice but felt like the writers didn\\'t know what they were doing and made stuff up as they went along.,Terrible performances from the VIPs, but not enough to ruin that fantastic tv series. This is marathon worthy: I couldn\\'t stop watching until the end. More than the sick games, the mistery behind the main plot was engaging and the end was surprising.,This show had the potential to be one of the best foreign mini series ever streamed world wide, maybe it is for some but not for me since the flaws it kept having but covered by the unexpectd shocking events and great actors, the final episode is the reason not to give this show a 9 or 10, the worst plot twist ever happened and ruined it to be a perfect masterpiece, season 2 isn\\'t necessary but seems like it\\'s happening anyway.,I didn\\'t want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I\\'ve had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.This isn\\'t just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It\\'s not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it\\'s executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it\\'s not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It\\'s not just filthy rich making poor fight.I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could\\'ve been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn\\'t any scope of it.,*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants\\' lives.Now, that\\'s all well and good. Who doesn\\'t love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would\\'ve made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn\\'t the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that\\'s it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don\\'t worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what\\'s his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn\\'t even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he\\'s only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN\\'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT\\'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder \"How bad are things in South Korea right now?\" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn\\'t actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn\\'t write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren\\'t bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I\\'m just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don\\'t understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn\\'t even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn\\'t you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it\\'s damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let\\'s do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun\\'s gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I\\'m getting tired at this point, so I\\'ll just leave it at that.If you don\\'t give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that\\'s something that interests you, watch an episode or two.,Players are you ready to Die for the price yes sir, what the hell is going on, this concept was so intriguing that i had to see this series and there and behold i saw it for my self can\\'t say I am a fan though but it\\'s that good.,I think any review and ratings for movies is reflective of the theme of this series itself. Is this series worth 10? Clearly no. But many will give it 10 for 2 reasons.1) Gore addicts. 2) Go with the hype.In a clear objective analysis. This series started out extremely good, original, and with very deeply moving and captivating backstories. However by about mid point, like many other series, they ran out of ideas and became cliche, just another Hunger Game, Saw, etc... remake.That being said, for the first part at least, I would give it a 10. The 2nd 1/2, is clearly a 5 and a balance of 7 to 7.5. Rounding down because of certain plot holes and inconsistencies which I will address here.1) Most of the game staff\\'s reactions through the series were puzzling and inaccurate. Everyone signed a contract and death waiver, so technically speaking, everything they were doing was legal. So why were they afraid of the police? Why overly secret? The scene when the front man realized a police was in his office, he pulled out a gun to hunt him. Why? They technically did nothing wrong. If anything, pulling out a gun to threaten the police made them wrong.This was clearly demonstrated in episode 2 that they even allowed the players to vote out of playing. They had no fear of any legal repercussion, yet then why rest of the series they were so worried about it? It is an error in their fundamental logic of the script.2) A lot of Koreans preached about how this is a series addressing income inequality in South Korea, maybe the whole capitalist world. Yet, in the film, every single player was there for a reason and not because they were victims. The main protagonist himself gambled away his money, despite having bad luck in the employment. He may not have a luxurious life, but his massive debt came from gambling and borrowing money from loan sharks.His best friend was even worse, a white collar criminal that embezzled from his clients, created fraudulent documents, etc... from \"bad investments.\" Cough cough, you mean pyramid schemes? From his character throughout the series, he was not a moral man, and revealed to be a psychopath. So he was there despite the fact he was not from the lower part of the wealth range.3) The night time massacre scene was either one of the most brilliant writing in this series or the worst, depending on whether it was intentional by the writers. What am I talking about?Either the writers blundered and just wrote in this cliche plot line of how people will turn on each other for money, to survive, and what not. Or ... it was deliberate to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the game system.Throughout the game, the gamer staff dictated an \"equal\" environment of 2nd chance, not only so, but one heavily and meticulously kept accountable. When they found out 1 player was cheating with the staff, they were eliminated and made examples of. Not only so, they observed their 3 fundamental rules so tightly, they even allowed them to vote out the game in episode 2.So the riot scene was out of place, either as a writers\\' blunder again in the inconsistency of the script, or it was brilliantly put in to demonstrate the hypocrisy of their so called game. They claim to have strict equal rules, even a democratic process, but in the end, used monetary incentive, greed, and starvation to thin the herd when necessary and to turn the players against each other rather than against the game staff. Players were suppose to play the games and be eliminated through the games, not murdered in their sleep. There was no accountability when that 1st man was murdered and as such created hostile environment rather than the promise of fair play.All of the sudden, the chance to vote out as a majority disappeared as the players were no longer divided into 2 groups, yes and no, but into multiple self-interested groups. This is... the heart of socialism, which might all along be the author\\'s intent.If it is... it is brilliantly done. Why?Take a step back and look at all 9 episodes. This is what it means then.In the capitalist world, there are winners and losers, there is a wealth gap. What socialism does, is preach to those who failed in the capitalist world, by their own hands, and a promise of a \"2nd chance,\" a better system, under the pretense of equality, a democratic process, accountability, and social order.However, in reality, all of this was done at gun point and the people, though voluntarily there, were there without choice because their alternative is go back to their failed life in the capitalist system. The socialist system itself is a deception, instead of order, they actually created chaos and pits people against people through greed, starvation, and manipulation. The people, which originally had a choice to democratically end it, then becomes enemies towards each other, losing sight of the real enemy that put them there in the first place. In the end, even if you win in a socialist system, like the protagonist, you really lose. The only real winners? Are the socialist creators.This is socialism\\'s core, what happened in many countries throughout history such as North Korea, China, Venezuela, and what is happening now in many western worlds, including the USA.,This show keeps you glued to your seat from start to finish. It\\'s done very well from every point of view, just the police actor shoul have been less younger.I hope for a second season.9/10 Bravo.,Is it just me or have American TV Series gone mind numbingly stale?Squid Game definitely has it\\'s flaws, but it definitely offers something fresh with a different perspective. And once again as with alot of Korean productions there is no fear of treading into dark territories without a care in the world for \\'Hollywood\\' endings or sentiments.Also unlike US productions, this story appears to have been limited to a single series.,Every aspect of Squid Game is done almost to perfection. The character development is perfect and draws you into the contestants lives. You end up genuinely caring about many of them.The show is vibrant and fresh with dark undertones leaving you feeling unsettled throughout.The ending seems slightly forced but not enough to diminish this exceptional piece of work.,I\\'ve enjoying this series, although it\\'s a couple of episodes too long, and definitely doesn\\'t stand to the hype that toots it.I appreciated the slightly more realistic portrayal of characters than in most movies, with good people shown to do bad things when pushed for survival.I also liked the balance of likeable characters from both genders, and the element of humanity, flawed such as it is.The story is not new, but there are a few twists in the first 3-4 episodes that I found smart enough. Starting with episode 7, the series starts to drag, and the ending is disappointing.Some details are far from smart (not to say plain dumb), but those details are minor enough not to cause stumbling.Overall, it\\'s worth watching.,Of course as soon as squid games blew up Korean shows started flooding Netflix remember when crockadile Dundee blew up in america back in the 80 and 90\\'s ya its like that.It will quickly fade as no one wants to do subtitles and bad translation and voice sync.There will be an audience in teh US but mostly like Anime it wont get mainstream again squid games was a fluke and it wasn\\'t that good.,I had to insist until engaging on to watch this one. In the beginning the cartoonish humor let me down very much. After overcoming that, it really gets interesting. Episodes leave you wanting to know what happens next. I felt very annoyed with all the main female characters but it was clearly the director\\'s intention. Despite hating any type of reality TV it is a good entertainer anyway.,Let me keep it straight.Squid Game has a better cinematography (see the color contrast!!!) but Alice in the Borderland is way darker (n thus better, personally) as a thriller and horror series. I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes. Which is to say, If u can\\'t stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it\\'s not something original and groundbreaking. As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane. The baddies are not that bad (at all!!). Finally, why there is always a super clean-n-tidy, pale skin, \"handsome\", smart, literate, elite entrepreneur young prince???? Where is the alpha-male?????!!!!!!,This drama has it all. The series highlights social issues while following a big group of desperate people trying to pay off their debts in a deadly game that entails children games turn bloody, lured in by a promise of big money.The simple question is how far would people go for a lot of money when they can\\'t pay their debts. The secondary question barely touched is who would get a kick out of the killing.,I was blown away when I first started watching this, but as the series went on it got a bit tedious, and some of the acting was terrible, especially from the woman who had the lighter, she almost made me want to abandon the whole series.There is some good acting though, and the idea of the series is very good and interesting.I\\'d like this to be re-made by the Americans, I think it would definitely be interesting.,This show has some serious hype at the moment so I thought why not give it a go. This series is such an interesting concept, it\\'s like a blend of hunger games and saw with some real life elements thrown in as well as some interesting Asian quirks. The way the show is set up just keeps you asking questions, the whole show is just a lot of questions really and it\\'s great as it keeps your mind racing. Once I\\'d started this series I couldn\\'t stop as I just needed to know what was happening next! This show just keeps you hooked and I love it. It\\'s pretty emotional at times also, I didn\\'t think I\\'d be so emotionally attached to these characters but by the end I was so engrossed and found myself really sad as certain characters were eliminated from the games. Honestly believe the hype that this show has and give it a watch!,Yes I might be exaggerating as it\\'s quite different, but in a way this show reminds me \"Number six\" who desperately tried to escape that island.I miss The Prisoner\\'s show, thus Squid Game fills it very well and even beyond.,There was quite a buzz around Squid Game over the last few weeks. There was positive as well as negative buzz regarding the violence.After watching through the show in the last 3 days I can say that the show is interesting in some aspects but has issues in others.The acting ranges from good to outrageously bad for some of the characters. The sound and visuals are pretty solid.When it comes down to the writing it\\'s a bit of a rollercoaster as there are good and bad things there as well. I didn\\'t really like the characters and some of the games presented were poorly thought out in terms of the rules and the characters didn\\'t notice these issues which then made them act stupid.The ending of season 1 is rather open and like with many shows leaves room for a season 2. The question is whether or not they can make season 2 also interesting because I think we have seen the best twists the show has to offer in the first season.Also looking at the shows as a whole I can get behind the message it tries to deliver even with the problems.,Just completed the series and found this show so thought provoking for many reasons. You have your standard character developmental checklist which is desperation, greed, boredom, curiosity, evilness and pure disregard that builds a cast of characters. The premise of the show is simple on the surface, but it much more complex the deeper you get into it.This show also brings a disturbing realization to me in real life:\\r\\nI mentioned the show to my daughter who is in her first year of teaching kindergarten. She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents. What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents. The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going. It\\'s not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality. 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother\\'s throat to get out of. What a warm and fuzzy thought!,The first episode is so packed and dense with brilliance that even though it\\'s only a hour long it felt like a full complete movie in and of itself, yet I was unable to look away the entire time it was that good.,I am an ardent follower of the Korean movies. Even though most of the movies are laden with violence, gore and bloodbath, the chills and thrills of most of the movies I have watched till date have not disappointed me. But I was a bit apprehensive of watching a Korean web-series even though it is insanely popular and one of the most trending shows in the recent past. The very name Squid Game , the latest offering from Netflix did not appear to be very much appealing. However, I risked my time on the rave reviews the show is getting. And boy! It has paid back. I cannot recall any single show more edge of the seat than this. Yes, there may be better shows in terms of intrinsic production values. But if you ask me to select one show where even for one second, I could not hold my breath, it was this, it was this, nothing but this. Normally my hectic work schedule does not allow me to binge-watch a show. But Squid Game eventually turned me to a Binge-watcher. It is so much enjoyable, spine chilling and mind bending.It is believed that even if ghosts exist, the human beings are capable of making this world even a more ghostly place than the original ghosts would do. Basically, greed, lust, lack of control, survival instinct, desire for power and authority, insanity make people do macabre things and when people get the taste of blood, they become even more dangerous than the man-eating animals. Squid Game captivates human emotions to an extent you are awestruck. The level where people can stoop to, to make things shinier for his own life will make you sick as you watch episodes after episodes of this brilliantly made series. The raw violence and gore trademarks of the Korean style of moviemaking is present throughout and this makes the show unsuitable for the children even though the central theme is based on the games played during childhood. In the age of Super Computers, when people have stopped playing those forgotten games any longer, a group of losers are seduced to play six rounds of those games. Winning will guarantee them freedom from every debt as the rewards of winning are astronomical. But the punishment for losing is what makes the series so very horrific, gruesome and rewarding- death. How the real-life losers vie with each other to redeem their own lost hopes is the plot of this super paced series.The show is full of metaphors. It may be worth mentioning that of late numerous movies have also come up with the portrayal of the absence of an egalitarian society in South Korea. The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. Remember Parasite and the subtle show of class struggle therein? Squid Game also tends to point fingers to the inequality prevailing in the South Korean society. Few references to the illegal immigration from North Korea are there, too.Squid Game in may ways is similar to one movie I watched long back- Exam. There also the creator worked on the same concept and I liked that movie. But in Squid Game, the dividends are more rewarding, scintillating and thrilling. I simply cannot recall a single dull moment in the entire show with a runtime of around eight and half hours. The lead actors especially Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae Soo, Jung Ho-yeon are stunning. The old man (I could not google his name) was fascinating. The script is tight, gripping and addictive. The cinematography is insanely horrific just what the screenplay demanded. The music matches with the spirit of the show. The creator Hwang Dong-hyuk creates an environment that is claustrophobic, ominous and jaw dropping.Overall, this show will haunt you days after you have finished watching it. Remember, it is not an easy watch because of the abundance blood spill. But if you are a lover of the thriller/horror genre, this is a series you have been waiting for years. This is going to make amends for the poor choices Netflix has been making for sometime now. Be a player, watch Squid Game.My Rating - 9.5 out of 10.,Battle Royal meets Belko Experiment with some SAW vibe twist at the end, that\\'s all I\\'m saying if you have seen those 3 films this is the show combined. I have nothing negative to say this show was so well done and hope to see a second season soon!,One of the best shows I have seen in quite some time 10/10 please give us more!! This show is so compelling and emotional and non-stop thrilling suspense!,First of all I really thanks to the makers who have build this series. The writers, directors and the actors for their phenomenal performances. The way show starts from its first episode it will just hold your mind and body and let you stay still. Production design and vfx work are outstanding.Performance of all the cast are looking so real and the horror sequences that happens in the show that will just blow your mind. Don\\'t wanna give much details just go and watch. You shouldn\\'t miss the show if you are a series lover. NETFLIX has done it again. Just WOW.....,Squid Game is an interesting and rather gruesome show about a group of financially troubled Korean adults who agree to play a sequestered group a children\\'s games in order to compete for a large cash prize. Little do they know that there is a substantial price for losing, and they soon find themsevles in a sort of Korean style Hunger Games. The main characters engage in a protracted struggle for survival--once the players agree to play, they are not allowed to leave unless a majority of the players agree to end the game. Spurred on by greed (the prize is over 20 million US dollars) most agree to play on to the finish.This series is quite entertaining, but thematically owes much to other recent last-person-standing movies like Battle Royale and Hunger Games. This show is interesting because the characters are trapped not so much by their social class as in the Hunger Games, but rather by their bad decisions that result in their financial desperation. In that sense, the show seems to hold up a mirror to what society tends to do to people--set them in competition with each other and then severely punish the losers. The games are conceptually very ingenious and produce both suspense and interesting moral dilemmas. There\\'s also a number of interesting subplots that I won\\'t give away as spoilers.Squid Game is a pretty entertaining and addictive watch, but beware, it is really violent. There is plenty of suspense and some good characters, so much to enjoy if you are into this genre.,Among other things, the writer/director stresses several times how the players are \\'equal\\' and must be treated fairly. Then near the end, when the 3 finalists cross the glass bridge successfully, he has the bridge panels explode with great ferocity and causes the young woman to be seriously wounded (and later has her killer explain that it was a mercy killing... that she was terminally wounded. That\\'s hardly fair, don\\'t you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP\\'s to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP\\'s Americans prejudicial. You mean all the world\\'s class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?,Good main character, interesting sets and the promise of an interesting series. As the series went on, it got more samey and ludicrous. After each episode I was thinking, this is getting worse and worse. The ending certainly confirmed this and the final episode was the worst of the lot.,Cube, Escape Room, The Cabin in the Woods, The Hunger Games....etc! Seems that mortal combats for the pleasure of elites has become very popular lately.Well, to be honest, it could have been so much better if it was made in America. A great plot though, some great lines(as well as cheesy ones) and twists but still lacks something in between. Sometimes it falls so deeply into its childish play you may wonder if the show has been made for juniors.Final thought: a very entertaining miniseries that I wished was made in Hollywood! End of story!,Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.What other, also terrible films (\"would you rather\" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of \"red light, green light\" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they\\'re playing children\\'s games, and why it\\'s all happening, might offer some comfort, but it\\'s all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the \"equality\" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it\\'s so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they\\'re badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content.,I just started this series. I\\'ll finish because the story is excellent. Good characters, good drama, thought provoking...all the makings of a stellar viewing experience.But in my whole life....the English dubbing on this is THE WORST and it totally takes away from the excellence of the overall story. I only speak English, and I\\'m finding myself taking mental notes of the million different better ways this could have been translated to make it more compelling. Seriously, the English in this series is like porn dialogue. Who at Netflix thought this translation mess was ok? Do better Netflix.,Finally after so much hypes and promotions over Social media platforms I have binge watched this Squid Games season 1 during this weekend. First of all this movie shows us the perfect examples of Human behaviors that too in a very practical way. The character development of this show is top notch and the set design/locations was tremendously great. The screenplay was good but I think it was dragged a bit to showcase the Game scenes and players emotions during gameplay which was good actually.Actually we have already watched this kind of concepts earlier so nothing new in it except those +ve points mentioned in above paragraph. It\\'s wholesome bloodsheds allover this show so it\\'s better if you\\'re 16+ then you can go for it. It have also a little sexual intercourse scene was there for around 40-45Sec so better to avoid watching with senior family members ; of course you can go with your brothers/sisters if they\\'re comfortable with these little scenes.And Finally I will rate it 6 out of 10 Stars from my side, because for me it\\'s just a One Time Watch kind of season. You can go for it... It\\'s worth spending time if you wanna enjoy a show during your leisure time.,The first five episodes are thoroughly entertaining, fast-paced, and establish each character in a sufficiently believable-if a bit hollow-way.From episode 6 onward, the characters become real human beings and the emotion hits HARD. The stakes become real and gripping. I loved it.There are several holes in the story that are never explained, but with this being a continuing series, there will be opportunity for them to fix that.This is far deeper than I was expecting.,It wasn\\'t until episode of the VIPs that I changed to have its original language and subtitles. This totally changed my view of the entire series and I may have to go back and rewatch it particularly because of the poor dubbing in English which the text wasn\\'t bad, it was the inflection and tone that was obnoxious.The last episode is profound and leaves an open for a second series. There is still confusion in my mind over the detective/brother plot line.,Just a thrilling series. The camera work,sets just beautiful,amazing acting. It keeps you wanting more. At the end we all where VIPS to the Squid Games.,Even after that atrocious second episode I\\'d recovered some interest and intrigue in the various plot-lines. I rated it a steady 7/10 and then the penultimate episode dropped me to a 6/10 then the last episode was awful: dead mum, red hair, pointless and unsatisfying twist with the old man. I mean, come on! If he wanted some people to play these old games with why not organise a tournament where no-one dies and everyone has a fun, happy time competing for the money? And the red hair - wtf? And the money - the old dear who has this adopted son foisted on her is going to agonise over spending those billions because she thinks it\\'s for Cho Sang-woo.I\\'m just gutted that the series played out the way it did becuase up to that point it was OK. Really though it never lived up to the tension of the set-up and the consequences of the first game.My conclusion to all this - Netflix have a brilliant marketing departmnet and they know how to dial the right dials even when the product isn\\'t that great, or original.,The was a fun, fascinating show that was more emotional than I ever expected it to be but also not as violent as I was expecting either. There is some brutal violence but extremely tolerable unless you are squeamish.Many of the characters you will feel a connection to even if they aren\\'t in the main cast. There are some you will enjoy getting their \"come up\\'ins\" to a satisfying end. The choices the lead characters make will enrage you and make you despise them but the backstory given to those characters will also make you understand why they do/did the things they do/did.There isn\\'t much in the way of surprises (except the hair, if you\\'ve finished you know what I mean) but there are some decent plot twists that may catch you off guard. The 6 games themselves, many across the world will know or may have even done; some you\\'ll be like \"really?\". All are brutal by design. This is worth the watch and dubbing in English didn\\'t look or sound as bad as it could have.,I was really enjoying this series until the last episode... it completely threw out the awesome character arc of the protagonist to set it up for a second season when it was obviously supposed to end of a semi-downer ending... which would have been effective and great.This film isn\\'t that original. It really bugs me that American audiences find this to be so \"unique\". This concept has been used in many plots... for a long time... Especially in Asian cinema. So everyone should just relax.Still, this is a pretty great series. I just feel sorry for anyone that has to watch the last episode...,Dont listen to twitter on this show its not over the top it has no deep message. Its just fine.,Good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated.,The best part about this show are the characters, gi-hun is a great main focus, say-byeok is a great secondary protagonist, sang-woo is a great twist villian after deok-su dies a few episodes short of the finale, and speaking of the final episode, that was my only problem with the show, the final episode is actually really confusing and the twist reveal at the end felt really forced, overall, this show is great, but the conclusion was disappointing, I\\'ll be sure to review season 2 when it comes out.,Wow this show had me on an emotional roller coaster. It really makes you wonder could you really be that cold if you were in the same predicament. I became invested in the main characters background stories and rooted for them throughout the entire competition. The most heartbreaking scene was when Ali died he was very kind-hearted and the game was too cut throat. I can\\'t believe the old man was the chairman behind this operation.,The acting is absolutely atrocious throughout with the possible exception of the female lead who\\'s a South Korean model turned actress and one or two others. The main female antagonist is one of the worst actors I\\'ve ever seen...ever, she overacts to the point that I was waiting for her head to explode and I cheered when she finally bought it so I wouldn\\'t be subjected to any more of her \"acting\". And even allowing for the dubbing the dialogue is often worse than the acting, corny, cheesy, very dated. And I found the main character to be too much of a loser, to the point that while I knew I was supposed to, I felt no sympathy for him at all. Because all of his problems were completely self-inflicted and he continued to be a loser through the entire series...I just didn\\'t care about him.There are plot holes wide enough to drive a truck through. Like the police detective who manages to infiltrate the island and fool everyone even though there\\'s security everywhere and the guards are computer coded. And lets not even mention how he was able to follow the van from about 30 yards back and then move around on the ferry without anyone seeing him....and I guess I missed the reasoning behind the Front Man being his brother and killing him....And yet.... I couldn\\'t stop watching it....because the writing is incredible, especially compared to the absolute drek coming out of Hollywood these days. And while the acting leaves something to be desired the characters are refreshingly realistic in the way they react to what\\'s happening around them. There are no heroics, no women who can kick the ass of a guy twice their size, no men who end up figuring a way out of the mess they\\'re in. There are just real people dealing with a horrific situation the way actual real live people would, not the way what passes for real people in Hollywood do. The emotions are raw, the situations are brutal and the good guys don\\'t always win because at the end of the day there aren\\'t any good guys...just people trying to survive but not giving a thought to what it\\'s costing them to do it. Episode six was the absolute high point of the series, it felt like a gut punch while I was watching it, how often can you say that about a mainstream series or movie these days? That episode was some of the best drama, some of the best writing I\\'ve seen in many years and I think it will stay with me for some time.Sorry to say that they couldn\\'t really maintain it after that. The resolution of the cops story line was lame and I\\'m not even sure why he was there at all. I\\'m sure there\\'s something I missed about why his brother, the Front Man, killed him but.... I missed it. The rich spectators were lame; basically tired cliché\\'s.And the end just kind of fizzled. I know a lot of people think the main character evolved during the games and came out a different person but I have to disagree. He was a loser at the beginning and still one at the end. The old man had a very good point in the final episode, every player was there by choice, they all left and, already knowing what it entailed, made the decision to return. Yet the main character seems to want to blame everyone else for his trauma, the old man, the people running the game, everyone except himself because nothing is ever his fault. He hasn\\'t changed, he makes a half-assed attempt to do right by his promise to the female player by getting her brother and dropping him off with his friends mother but he apparently abandon\\'s the girls mother in the north and in the end fails his own daughter...yet again because he\\'d rather wallow in guilt and his own self-inflicted misery that try to move on. He\\'s still a loser....just a rich one.Squid Game is yet another version of a very old and well worn story, the difference is that it made the characters into real people who dealt with what was happening around them the way real people would. That\\'s what makes it better than other versions of the same story. And it makes it light years better than any of the drek being churned out by Hollywood these days. Even with it\\'s flaws I highly recommend it. Just be prepared to be emotionally beaten up by it!,This is a simple formula that has been done to death \"poor people being made to do highly fatal games while rich people watch\". By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like \"it\\'s an study of human nature\" etc etc. The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes. This world and it\\'s environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games. I enjoyed it well enough but let\\'s face it, this is no 8.0+ IMDB ratings are a joke.,The problem with a mini series that starts out as good as this one is, it\\'s really hard to keep the same intensity for eight more episodes. The first episode is arguably the most intense and shocking 55 minutes ever filmed. So there\\'s bound to be a drop off. Even so, the entire series is extremely watchable and even binge worthy. If you\\'re looking for something different... THIS IS IT !!,A breath taking series\\r\\nA game of wealthy and pain through pleasure beasts in human form, against desperate people for money...\\r\\nBetting their precious lifes just for one to take the price and get out alive\\r\\nWould you play?Watch it now!!!,I started watching this series having heard that it is one of the most successful Netflix series ever produced. It was definitely a great series. The treatment, social message etc were great. Kinda reminded me of a movie I watched called Platform. But i would stop short of calling it the best. The concept might have been given a bit different treatment but at the end it was still akin to an escape room. The scenario under which the participants come back also sounds far fetched. Ok there could be a lot of difficulties and hardships in the outside world but would someone want to go back to a place risking their lives where they are 99% sure to die. But the show depicts that the people once left the show first time they were so desperate for money that they came back irrespective of the dangers there. Not so believable according to me. The reasoning of the old man why he conducted this game was also kind of ridiculous. But all fine in the name of fiction. Loved the characters otherwise.,Content: ok. The creativity in the horror genre, depicting the dark side of society, human decadence.Visual effects: nothing\\r\\nMusic: nothing.Emotions. Feeling scared by the killing scenes. Fear Level: 3/5. As the episodes go on, the fear decreases\\r\\nFeeling angry in episode 8.Feeling sad and emotional in episode 6.Feeling quite nervous before the games starts.Average score of episodes: 6+7+7+4+5+7+4+8+6/9ep=6.Good and positive messages and emotions: almost none.Should this season be re-watched?: No.,The show is just okay. I don\\'t get all of the hype. There are a lot of plot holes and the story doesn\\'t make much sense. There are too many slow motion shots. I think it\\'s because there isn\\'t much of a story. None of the characters are likeable. You never really care about who lives or dies.,Attractive games I remember the chess game on Harry potter movies.I hate the cheater who killed Ali. And the policeman is really annoying hope see him dead.,First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes \"Kamisama no iu tôri.\" It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i\\'ve always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. It\\'s hard to connect with the story and the actors when they\\'re expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from \"actors\" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.Finally: Squid Game could\\'ve been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else. This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. The games wasn\\'t fun (and we\\'ve seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring.,I have been very greatly entertained by this series. I would have given it a 10 but I took a point off because of the poor acting from the VIP\\'s and the ending that seemed rushed. I could have thought of a better suited and deserving ending instead of a destructive one. I also did not understand the drastic change of hair color in the end. The subtitles can also be improved. Accurate translations including the slangs can change the effect of any foreign film.All in all, this series is fantastic! It has interesting twists and surprises. It is violent so I definitely do not recommend for kids to watch even though it has kids games in it. The story reminded me of The Hunger Games but also unique in its own way. I would classify this as Horror/Drama/Thriller genre. The character development is very well written where a lot of movies fail to succeed. It is very important to any movie. Episode 7 for me is quite emotional and also 9. You have to be cold hearted not to fight back the emotions of what this episode brings. All the main characters did a great job. I like the mixture of different types of people. Definitely recommend.,68/100I finally decided to finishe this show after being on my list for months. I don\\'t have much to say other than to highlight the inconsistency of the script of its episodes, which became extremely annoying after a few chapters.For instance, episode 6 is easily the best episode of the entire series. Right after, you are introduced to one of the worst; it\\'s almost as if you have to reward those moments when Squid Game truly shows its innovation. That\\'s why the ending, although disappointing, I can\\'t be surprised at the fact that it was executed in such a way.Speaking of whether or not this series is truly innovative, it definitely has its own quirky streak, one that the series isn\\'t afraid to exploit almost 100%. Many times these moments may not work for me taking into account the contrasting contextualization that the program possesses but, one way or another, it\\'s still appreciated.Impressive performances by the cast but that can be affected once certain new characters enter.The only thing that really remained throughout the program was its technical aspects. It got to a point where I was blown away by some of the editing decisions the series would make. They would seem simple, but they are refreshing to see for a series with so many \"action\" scenes.Squid Game fully understood how to stand out, which is why it will become one of the most remembered shows in the coming years. However, popularity never meant quality, and this might be the best example of that saying yet.,I bought into the hype and watched this mess. I am very confused about what people see in it. I can look past the horrible over acting by the VO artists, stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development. I stuck it out until the end and was completely let down. By far, the worst finale of any series in history.,It was good - but no where near as good as all the hype and talk led you to believe. The basic concept - we\\'ve all seen it before - but still nonetheless it was okay - I enjoyed watching it, it\\'s a bit over the top and actually fairly predictable - but it was good, but no where near as good as so many people are making it out to be!,Very well done production. It was like a modern day Twilight Zone. Character development was excellent, music/score was spot on and like another important character, and story was well done. It was creepy, chilling, bloody, touching, and emotional. It had a little bit of everything.The very few complaints about it I do have don\\'t outweigh the good points - The acting was a little over-done at times. The voices and lines of the VIPs were way over-acted, the subtitles were very fast and hard to keep up with at times, and the last episode/ ending was just a little too bizarre - it took away from the good parts of the earlier episodes.But definitely watch it.,I hate violence in movies but somehow could not stop watching this. The story is intriguing - a group of down-in-their-luck men and women were invited to play a series of kids\\' games that pitted their lives against each other for a prize of billions of wons. I couldn\\'t help wondering whether millions of viewers all over the world also have the same question: if you are up to your neck in debt, would you join the game?I guess the reason I kept watching this despite my aversion to violence is because the violence is necessary to show viewers the horrendousness of greed. It shows how evil love of money is, that one would be willing to die for it. This begs another question: how is this game different from the game millions of people play everyday, sacrificing their relationships, health, principles, dignity and self-respect for jobs and other sources of income?,SG is a foray into the callused debauchery of which humans are capable. It builds on \\'The Most Dangerous Game\\' w/ a twist. Here, bored positive-balance-sheeted rustlers devise a game, that enables them to entice poor souls in financial straits, to come out & play. The key is in what the players weren\\'t told, not what they were: 456 competitors may enter, but only one will exit alive at the end. These Tattersalls denizens don\\'t compete, except to bet on the \"horses\" performances... & deaths.SG asks its viewers if they believe humans are good. Not quite, right? I was yelling at the screen like I was back at, well, the races. It isn\\'t a matter of players acting horror-movie-lame, rather, it\\'s their failure to timely process how, at a frenzied Gallop, the race was degrading into barbarism. Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!! Work on the word \"NO!\" Augh! Pleading w/ them has no effect. All viewers can do is watch in dismay.The violence is lurid, but not gratuitous. Author, Hwang Dong-hyuk, stated his purpose: \"I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life.\" He was poaching from the gauntlet of his own fiscal hardships.Kdramas excel at juicing the viewer to extract every wince & gasp. The paddock lined w/ dewy pink, Easter green & childlike trappings is a visceral mocking horror; a real dread multiplier.The players aren\\'t the only losers. The police Ofr\\'s story is grim. Hwang Jin-ho went there to save his brother. Seduced by the power of the dark side, the frontman won\\'t let *anybody* move in on *him*. So he brought his own brother down. That\\'s pain. Frontman actor, Lee Byung-hun, aced an expression of curtailed grief, tinged with guilt, + overt resolve to cantor forward. After all, it was his brother or him.1 - 456, when Kdrama screen writers assign #s to players, they likely have a correlation to their values in Numerology. It\\'s about adding layers of depth & meaning to the script, & not for pushing a belief system. We can easily decode what the writer is announcing b/c varied Numerology websites are fairly consistent. While the definitions, as in astrology, tend to be generalized so as to broaden the application, let\\'s jump in to see if any of the player\\'s #s are messages to viewers.>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & #456 signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach a #456 how work harder on oneself and add value to life. 456 picked up 001 as a gganbu trainer, evincing that, plainly, moral fortitude is no prerequisite.>218 is Cho Sang-woo, 456\\'s \\'friend\\' who worked up from the \\'hood,\\' to being a whilte-collar hood. To a point, he mirrors 001. This loathsome in-runner surprisingly gave up the fight, but not before becoming a murderer. #218 is for manifesting one\\'s biggest & on the face, near impossible desires (💰) into reality. Business, duality, & serving humanity must coexist. 218 knows that 456 will serve his mother AND humanity w/ the 💰. 218 failed in his run to win that💰, but he found redemption in his last moments.>067 is Kang Sae-byeok, from NK, who strives to protect her family. No surprise: #067 signifies home, family, unconditional love, responsibility, sacrifice & service. Creating a solid foundation for the future, & protection of family & possessions is a #067\\'s priority.>001, the old man, is most positive when pacing for work. #001 is, recognition for 1st place; it represents independence, but can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>101 is gangster, Jang Deok-su. A #101\\'s primary function is romance, w/ importance of relationships right behind. At first blush this doesn\\'t fit w/ the character, though he did get involved in a quasi romantic trist. Let\\'s flesh it out further.A #101 needs coexistence. Without it, a #101 is alone. People w/ that # can feel lonely & lost just thinking of being alone. 101 obviously grew up w/o basic needs & training, leaving him consumed w/ bitterness & ill-prepared for rigid competition. #101 also points to eternity & the journey that is about to begin w/all its uncertainties. It\\'s a reminder that we are not in control of our destiny, God is, so #101s should follow the course & learn before their time on this plane is over. It\\'s sad to think that 101 didn\\'t get emotional support or the care needed for success. He is still responsible for his infractions, but it\\'s sad, none the less. He parallels the VIP who was attracted to the cop. They both had the same expression of shock, disbelief, & the beginnings of acceptance, when facing death.>199 is Abdul Ali, one of the worst upsets of the show. #199s are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda. For Ali it\\'s providing for his family - independently. A #199\\'s goals virtually never conflict w/ humanity\\'s survival & long-term well-being. We see that Ali is good, albeit naive, & foolish to be so independent that he\\'d wager his life on a long shot to try & provide for his family.>212 is Han Mi-nyeo, the \\'crazy Mare\\' who brought down 101. #212s frequently chase curiosity & adventure, and ALL new, shiny objects, often on a whim. #212s can be good team member & their energy can be sensual. Jumping the fence may lead to negative outcomes. Enroute towards goals, they can face harsh obstacles. An add\\'l similarity to 101 is that only the negative interpretations are exhibited by them. Their harsh lives had severed them from the positive elements w/in themselves. They portray ruthlessness, but there is a forlornless about them, too.>111 is the doctor. A #111 won\\'t let himself be slotted into a team member role, unless the role is real leadership. They haven\\'t been broken. If #111\\'s thoughts are negative, it could attract toxic situations & people.>240 is just released from prison for putting down her abusive \\'sire\\', \\'Philly\\' Ji-yeong. #240 is about nurture & mutual support w/ a high focus on security & the future, all provided without expectation of return. She went underfoot for 067, & thus negated the lie the VIP\\'s tell themselves about human nature. Having already sacrificed her freedom to deliver justice to her mother, 067 is the moral center of the show.>244, the pastor: Spiritual advancement can be phenomenal in a #244\\'s life. He must keep wrong at bay & not offend the inner energy installed by his maker.>The husband/wife duo is portrayed in #69, or two identical digits facing & complimenting each other to make a whole. If we squeeze 6&9 together we can make an 8, which, toppled, is the eternity sign. In addition, the visual aspect of the # is related to ying&yang. The energy of #69 is best when involved directly w/family or team as an equal. Freakily, #069 symbolizes the closure of a chapter in life & encourages one to be prepared for traumatic phase. Whether ending good or bad, it is bound to bring a huge change. Be prepared for it, b/c the the manner in which it\\'s dealt with will effect one\\'s future.Finally, upon the runners\\' return, in EP3, 187 players re-enter the stalls: The US police code for murder.Getting chills?Oh, these \"poor,\" rich, hacked-up GOONS. Their lives are so empteee. Sigh. Studies show around 21% off CEO\\'s are psychopaths. It\\'s not a stretch to guess that some of these fulsome degenerates are in that club, given their heightened sadism. These reprobates can\\'t seem to notice through all the haze of pride, that people are most gratified when we help others.001 didn\\'t get what he wanted by hosting SG, which was a panecea for loneliness & boredom. It seems he & the VIPs justify their actions by deluding themselves that they are conducting a social experiment - Reassuring themselves that everyone is as cutthroat as they, leads to pitting people against each other. This enables them to inveigle their own selves that those people deserve to die: \\'Just look at who they really are! It\\'s voluntary... Anyway, they all get a fair chance.\\'In the end, the old man had the whole world, but was utterly unsatisfied. Craving the comraderie he\\'d had while growing up poor, he felt that kinship w/ 456, even though 456 eventually betrayed him. At the time, 456 even had a second chance. He could have done the all-or-nothing, but refused. That plot point of betrayal, while needed, was his worst moment. The old man was playing him all day to tempt him, but he meant it when he called 456 his gganbu, or close buddy.The kinship manifests itself when the old man wants to see HIM at the end of his life. 456 is there, bedside, when #1 dies. Where\\'s his wife? Where\\'s his kids?? Where\\'s his grandkids??? Can I get a mistress? Nope. Just 456 & an aid were there. Next, 001 saves 456\\'s \\'life\\' a second time, by jerking 456\\'s bit toward living, rather than merely existing.456 is who he is. He wins 3x\\'s in the show\\'s run, but even when he wins, he\\'s a pathetic loser that barely stumbles over the line. In winning, his soul was put-down. When he went to see the old man in the penthouse, he won their game, but he again, didn\\'t get what he wanted, as 001 died before 456 could kill him. It did wake 456 up. He no longer has to feel guilty about flashing a laser in the old man\\'s eyes during the race: His regret is not shipping 001 off to the dog food plant himself.The red hair broadcasts that he\\'s now either on fire, or starting to blaze his trail. Finally. This is not over. We need a season 2. The question has not been answered yet. #456 is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. Here\\'s my ante-post bet & hope: In S2, he\\'ll be stallion #789 who tramples out the ghoulish fraternity of gamers.Quote:\\r\\nGood rain knows when to fall -Du Fu-IMHO~>\\r\\n🎭8 🎬8 🤔8⚡8🎨7🔚9\\r\\nFor age 15+,SG is another foray into the callus debauchery of which humans are capable.

The players do soon understand that the only rules that apply are the ones that they are explicitly given by the referees. The penalties for running out of the basepaths are, Umm... Severe.The first two episodes focus on the wild swings 456 experiences when his journey begins.

We\\'ve been waiting for you;) Just relax, you should achieve your subtitle fitness almost immediately. The whole world is watching our entertainment deposits that way. If you can\\'t diversify, they win!K-dramas excel at withdrawing every possible wince & gasp out of the viewer. In general, the writing, directing, acting, & overall play are consistently supplying returns on investment due to the high quality of execution. So much so, that they\\'re in danger of their stats being overlooked. Korea\\'s got talent.SG is more of the same. It is superb dressage, or pagentry. This particularly applies to the horror genre, which is loaded with dumbed down characters& dialogue, lots more blood& guts, & an extraordinarily evil feel to the substandard works. A de-worming & thorough muck-out is in order. SG blows the whistle on those foul circulations. The violence is jolting, but not gratuitous or meaningless. There is a message for us.Yet, K-Dramas, like Simone Biles, can twist professionally, with beautiful strength. K-Dramas spiral the knife into the viewer\\'s psyche with disciplined follow-through. The absolute demented sickness of using the innocent color pink, with other pseudo-cheerful colors, (that also resemble many medicines, such as Pepto Bismal) plus the kiddie trappings (such as the giant doll) is all nauseating. It a dread multiplier.K-dramas also tend to drop players on the audience that are the most extremes of themselves in the beginning of the shoot. A multi-episode show allows ample time to invest in talent to improve performance & yield gains. Just remember that most of the people you see on the screen will either dramatically transform, or the audience\\'s appreciation of them will change, as the series matures. You may squander your currency backing a failing commodity, while another\\'s performance might lead your fantasy team to victory. 456 is pathetically & painfully a substandard performer of the worst sort: over 40, living with mom, swiping her money to go gambling on horses... Has he ever been bullish? Not likely. He\\'s thoroughly contemptible, & relegated to the penny stocks. I was aggravated at the thought of up to 9 innings/episodes monitoring his performance. It was doubtful he would gain any interest.Every competing \"horse\" has a number. If Korean screen writers assign numbers to jerseys, or saddlepads, it\\'s likely said numbers have a commodity backing their values in Numerology- This is not meant to be an endorsement, it is to forensically decode what the writer is announcing in the stadium. Definitions in Numerology, like astrology, tend to be generalized. This broadens the applications, & provides a utitly player that can rebound into several positions. Having said that, Let\\'s see if any of the numbers the author assigned have any credit values...>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach how to learn to work harder on oneself before other things. Hard work will add value to life.Check. It\\'s applicable.>218 is for Cho Sang-woo, 456\\'s friend from the \\'hood.\\' The number 218 symbolizes manifesting one\\'s biggest & seemingly impossible desires into reality, often related to wealth.>001, the old man\\'s # is at its most positive when in the realm of work. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. This number represents independence, but this can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>199 is Abdul Ali. 199\\'s are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda, which, for Ali, is providing for his family on his own. #199\\'s goals virtually never conflict with long-term human survival & well-being.Check, check, check, again. And on it goes.Getting chills? If not, you probably haven\\'t seen the show yet. Just wait until you do. The strategy trotted out is medal-winning. Just be woke about what the show is about. It is not about displaying incidental, cheap, & meaningless horror for the purposes of titillation. SG is a metaphor for the writer\\'s own hardships in a cruel, uber competitive & heartless society. The players all represent the downtrodden, like geldings in irons.Most of their backstories, if broadcasted on GoFundMe, would get scouted for assistance. I\\'d be tempted to contribute to several of them. Even the criminals are subtley shown to have been wedged into their life choices. Delving into one gangster\\'s number (101) exposes his basic needs that clearly weren\\'t met in his life. It played a role in his projected gains & losses.K-dramas are also wont to lob surprises, or deferred options the viewer didn\\'t account for, into the works. Expect that not everything is what it seems to be. Avoid being roped in by Ponzi Schemes.This is not over. We need a season two. The question has not been answered yet. 456\\'s number is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. To the extent that he accomplishes anything, true to form, he would barely get a neck over the line. Heres my ante-post bet & hope: In season 2, he\\'ll be the stallion that tramples the game runners as a #789.Apologies for mixing monetary, equestrian, & sports metaphors over here. I\\'m not good with rules either.Quote:\\r\\nGood rain knows when to fall. ~Du Fu~I also did a spoiler review.🎭8.5 🎬8.5 🤔8⚡8🎨7🔚9.,I really liked the three first episodes, none of the following were bad but the three first were great. Some parts of this series is a great psycological exploration of friendship, sacrifice and human desperation. The ending was unexpected in some ways.,One problem I am finding is with more asian made entertainment, now they get higher ratings by other asians simply because it\\'s asian made. Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture.I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn\\'t love it like some are. It\\'s yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style. It\\'s not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing. Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing.This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio. We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles. But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes. So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs.And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)..... it is AWFUL. Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices. I know some don\\'t like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion.,You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked...\"Can money buy you happiness?\". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN\\'s exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?There\\'s just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly. The VIPs though are very bad in acting that is one negative. Overall, a must watch entertainer which can be binge watched in one go (or you may take two days considering it is a bit too long).,This show is a farce. The acting is Atrocious!!!!!! How is this drivel getting such high reviews???? It\\'s terrible, its awful.,10/10 great tv series, must watch unlike any other series you watched/,Kids may not know it is basically a copy of the Japanese movie \"As the Gods Will\" - the first chapters are identical concepta add then bits of \"Escape Room\" \"The Cube\" and the ultraviolence of \"A clockwork Orange\" (btw the VIP lounge scene is obviously idea taken from the Clockwork Orange movie\\'s \"Milk Bar\" scene).Also the English subtitles are awful.The ending was so disappointing. And the last episode was half as long! Underwhelming.,The show was decent, worth watching but not as great as some are saying. Took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing. Get ready for season 2.,I put it on my watchlist because I absolutely love korean thrillers. I love the style and the type of writing the screenplay of almost every korean thriller and drama. Then I went to vacation and when I came back the hype about this series was incredible. I hope that more people love korean movies and series now as much as I do. Very nice, didn\\'t disappointed and is as good as I expected when putting it on my watchlist.,Must Must must watch it, I finished it in just one day, i was glued with my chair whole day to finish last episode get predictable But it don\\'t ruin your enjoyment. I heard about it from one of my friend and watched it and won\\'t regret.,Let me preface: no, I am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can\\'t wrap my head around the hype. Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc. So I\\'m thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it\\'s new or innovating.Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there\\'s only one winner.In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste. Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not. I didn\\'t enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. I\\'d suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be.,As a Korean series, it was good actually. Good acting from the Korean actors, but foreigners? NO, It was extremely bad as you feel that they are just reading what they have to say\\r\\nAnyways, it takes eight for all.,After \"Liar Game\" and \"Alice in Borderland\" we have \"Squid game\".Some parts have been gruesome and to much fo me but thank God it\\'s on Netflix and I could skip :).Marbles game was so emotional that I have cried a little and I\\'m not ashamed to admit it.Very happy to have binge watch it.PS. Gong Yoo from \"Train to Busan\" or Goblin has also a short appearance among many other known actors from K-dramas.,Kind of the same thing as Alice in borderland except the motives, characters, and drama are done much better. I also like that most of the characters are adults with relatable issues. I\\'m tired of teen drama. Take note Netflix you got a winner here.,After a couple of episodes I thought I wouldn\\'t last to the end of the series. But it became oddly compulsive, and by about half way you definitely want to know how it all ends.But it is not that great. There is a lot of repetitiveness in the story, and it is drawn out over rather too many episodes.Moderate acting, but the main character was good.If you are looking for something different, well worth a try - as long as you can tolerate extreme violence.,Yes this can be seen as a dystopian fiction. Like Maze Runner, Hunger games, you name it. But the fact that they put children\\'s games into the mix was a concept that was pulled off very well and in a way that made you feel a major amout of tension. I can only hope that this gets renewed for Season 2. If not then it had a hell of a run.,You know, not that bad considering overhype. Ephemera, no more, but has a good picture, music and let\\'s say not so banal development of events( of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer, but for most series and viewers), let\\'s say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement (usually it is so). Strongest side of this series is an acting, it is really solid. I think, considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as 1.,It started slower than I had anticipated, but I understand it\\'s because they want the viewers to get to know one of the main characters a bit more. The games themselves are fun, yet sometimes sad to watch.....you will know what I mean when you get to the marbles game......no spoilers here! The show gets better as the episodes go on and I found myself rooting for a few of the participants. It\\'s a fun show to watch, but the cruelty of humankind is just insane. The lengths people will go to survive is real and sad. I watched with subtitles because dubbing is always terrible and takes away from the characters in my opinion. Overall, I would recommend this show as it\\'s very different from anything out there and after episode 3, keeps you in your seat.,The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a \"battle royale\" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn\\'t matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a \"good heart\" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don\\'t matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are \"forced\" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, \"we can win this with everyone still alive\". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a \"final boss\" enemy in the show.I won\\'t spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of \" saw that coming\" and \"give me a break\" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further.,Squid Game has to be the most unique show I\\'ve ever seen in my life. Everything from the music, cinematography and genius storytelling lead it to be my favorite show of 2021 and in my new Top 10 fav shows of all time...,I think the first 4 episodes were really excitement but gradually at the end of this seire I think that was really boring and really predictable, especially the last episode in my opinion was really terrible!,I think the first 4 episodes were really excitement but gradually at the end of the serie the movie was really boring and predictable! Especially the last episode was really terrible and I hoped that I shouldn\\'t follow this seire!,Started well. But mid way through, it gets tired and feels sluggish. The games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc. The ending was horrible and vague.It shows that losers will be losers even after winning. Just not relevant in today\\'s world.,This is for immature kids. Its your classic Netflix show. I kept hearing people say its good so tried to give it a good go bit start of episode 3 i had to switch off as my brain cells were slowly dying LoL.,Very similar to \"The Running Man\" (1987) in plot, although it plays more like \"Battle Royale\" (2000) and \"The Belko Experiment\" (2016).The whole story starts with a broken loser getting contacted by a guy that knows absolutely everything about him (in an almost supernatural way.) He invites him to play a game, which would reward a humongous amount of money to the winners (if there are more than one winner, the money is divided amongst them, inciting them to try to win alone.)When playing the first game, though, the players find out that losing means dying (or getting killed!) Obviously, people freak out and a lot of them die immediately. After that, people vote to go back home, without any prize.Episode 2 is dedicated to show the survivors that their lives are hell on earth, so many of them decide to go back into the game. That was at the same time the best episode of the whole series and the worst: a whole episode filled with fabricated drama, to built backgrounds for many characters, which prove to be absolutely meaningless later on, because the story simply ignores their psychological profiles and life baggage, making them act and react at the necessity of the plot.Key characters\\' personalities change \"sides\" just too many times along the series, at the will of the writer. For instance, the protagonist starts as a jerk, stealing money from his mother (for gambling, nonetheless,) then becomes a soft-hearted man, trying to connect with his daughter and save everybody, then becomes a jerk again, trying to save himself at the cost of others\\' lives, then soft again, then jerk, and so on. Especially in the last episode, his changes make absolutely no sense whatsoever.Before his last friend dies, she asks him to promise to go look for her brother, but he doesn\\'t promise (in a \"I won\\'t promise, because we are both getting out of here\" kind of moment, although not actually voiced that way.) When he\\'s out, he enters jerk mode, effectively not going after her brother for a whole year.Anyway, his girl friend is killed by his ex-best-friend-forever, so, obviously, the protagonist is forced into jerk mode and tries to kill his ex-friend-turned-arch-enemy... Until he has an opportunity to win the game and let him die... Making him go back into soft mode... Then his ex-best-friend, for absolutely no imaginable reason, kills himself (in a \"if I don\\'t die, we are both going to die, so I better kill myself, because you bozo won\\'t let me die\" moment...) Game over! The protagonist wins, time to go home, in jerk mode, of course, for reasons.Then, another plot twist, shamelessly copied from \"Saw\" (2004): one of the protagonist\\'s previously dead friends was not dead at all, he was the mastermind and game master! After a long and boring speech, which is basically a Korean translation of the final speech from \"Saw III\" (2006), the protagonist enters soft mode again and go after his dead girl friend\\'s brother (something that makes absolutely no sense, as she had never said who or where he was, because she was very secretive about her past, having escaped from North Korea - even her name was kept secret!)BUT (yes, a huge \"but\" there) he was in false soft mode! After getting the boy out of the orphanage he was kept in, he ditches him (and a case full of money) with the old mother of a dead friend and disappears! After that, he enters actual soft mode and gets a ticket to fly to meet his daughter, whom he supposedly loved so much that he decided to risk his life getting back into the Squid Game (to be fair, he also did it to save his mother\\'s life, whom he finds dead after he goes back home, but two wrongs don\\'t make one right, right?)BUT (oh no, another plot twist!), on his way to the airport, he meets the guy that recruited him to play the Squid Game...! And does nothing about it! He continues on his way to the airport, because he loves his daughter, right? Apparently, wrong! As he\\'s boarding the plane, he decides to pick the recruiter\\'s card and call: he wants revenge for what they did to him, and he\\'s mad, and he\\'s back in full throttle jerk mode...! What, again, makes absolutely no sense! The mastermind is dead, so whoever is the game master has absolutely nothing to do with him! Besides, he voluntarily decided to enter the game, so, if any one\\'s to be blamed for all that happened, it\\'s himself!Except for one game (tug-of-war), all others are amazingly lame and people die for nothing, just to advance the plot toward the scripted lame ending.The random changes of heart of the characters made me want to finish watching the series just to get over with it and never look back. Aside from the protagonist\\'s soft/jerk mode switching, what happened to his ex-best-friend-forever was probably the worst character development I have ever seen. In the beginning, we are made to believe he\\'s a nice guy with a truck-load of bad luck. Then, when he\\'s back into the game, he secretly tries to kill all of his friends, for absolutely no reason. To make it very clear that the first time was not a mistake or misunderstanding, he does it again and again and again till the final game.Because of all those completely random and irrational changes, I was simply unable to hate the ex-best-friend or sympathise with the protagonist! All I could see was a stupid writer forcing the characters to push the plot forward, against logic and common sense.And talking about logic and common sense, did I mention that the Squid Game is a secret organisation? Well, it is, kind of obviously. As mentioned before, the \"people\" behind it have an almost supernatural knowledge about everyone and nobody outside have any knowledge about it/them. Even so, the series introduces a subplot twist: there is a secret organisation operating inside the secret organisation, stealing and trafficking organs from the people that die in the games, without anyone in the Squid Game society noticing! Later, it\\'s revealed that the Squid Game society actually knew that there was an organ trafficking group working behind the scenes, what makes even less sense, because how could a secret society infiltrate inside an even more secret society, and why would that society let such a huge liability operate freely inside it?The best character in the whole series is a random police officer that collects the protagonist\\'s report about the Squid Game society when he gets out the first time. Despite not believing in his seemingly absurd story about a secret society playing deadly games, he tried to help him in all ways he could.I\\'ve heard that there will be a second season, but I don\\'t want to watch it, because the protagonist is a schizophrenic jerk, the Squid Game society is made of dumb jerks (making people outside necessarily even dumber, as they can\\'t figure them out) and the writer knows absolutely nothing about character development. Even if the producers would fix all those issues, what I absolutely doubt, the series would still be completely unwatchable, because either the protagonist stays the jerk anti-hero he\\'d been for most of the first season, or he\\'ll be the jerk superhero, that abandoned his daughter for revenge, who he seemed to have become in the last few seconds of the last episode, that is, either way, he\\'ll be a jerk.,Finally finished this series. This is series is sticky, i mean it stick viewer toward, full of suspense, i really enjoy its game and i didn\\'t expect that last game ends so easily in that\\'s point i didn\\'t satisfy. However i think they also made 2nd season after seeing its ending gin hun (lead character) didn\\'t take the flight. GOOD series.,I really don\\'t know what all the fuss is about... The acting is strong (as expected from Korean actors and actresses) but most people are talking about the plot, which to me, is nothing special. Sure there are some plot twists but there are also way too many gaps for this to be called a \"classic\" or \"masterpiece\".,I Felt like one or two episodes too long.Some were great and some too much monologue.Still pretty good TV version of battle Royal.Or perhaps a TV show of the movie \"Would you rather\".,This show sucked me in on the first episode. The acting is superb and the plot is great. The only issue is the VIPs, that\\'s where the acting is bad and writing fell apart. Luckily the VIPs are only in one episode so it doesn\\'t ruin the entire series. I binged this on Netflix after watching one episode. Hoping for a season 2.,The story centers around 456 individuals who are in debt, and accepts the invite to play games for a chance at a large cash prize. Like Alice in Borderland, their lives are at stake. The tv series is great compared to Alice in Borderland. We can understand better where the characters are coming from, and what drives them as individuals. And the idea of deadly children\\'s games is unexpected and refreshing. With each death of the main characters, some do feel sadness and disappointment. However, the tv series is not perfect, with my ability to predict who will win, who will be betrayed, and who is behind it all. And let\\'s be honest, many of us were rooting for another person to win the prize. Anyways, I hope there will be a season 2, with the \"cliffhanger\" not being that shocking.,Didn\\'t expect to see exactly that what the movie is, but that was just the pleasant surprise. I like the idea of the people target to play the game, how they refuse, yet reinvolve - there is a message already in the first two episodes. As for how the show goes - good acting with great selection of casual-looking people, it holds its Asian manners, which is also his charm - brings their specific craziness and cruelty even, yet at some moments it is funny just as they can do it, but it is not a comedy at all. The entire show intends to bring a message, even after the outcome, it is a nice thing after so much gore. And happily, we don\\'t see another unnecessary and intrusive homo love story.The scenes are captive, great colors and screen format, all the details are perfectly touched, the music nicely fits the acts. No wonder Squid Game is so popular, it simply deserves it.,I really wanted to enjoy this series after all the hype, but just found it lacking in any real substance. There is a very linear story line, people in a lot of debt get invited to play some very basic games. Twist is, they get killed if they don\\'t win. That\\'s it. There is some initial shock during the first game, but that wanes as the series progresses. There are a some semi-interesting, but predictable back stories, and most of the characters have few, if any redeeming features, so you don\\'t really care who survives. It is easy to be seduced by the initial shock of the first reveal, but it really doesn\\'t progress much from there. I\\'d recommend. Midnight Mass on Netflix if you want some real horror.,It\\'s a watchable series but not something that will make me watch a season 2. The cast is great, acting is good (except for the English speaking VIPs wearing masks). The personal stories of the contestants and how they interact between each other make the series more human than just a survival game. It does get bloody and somewhat violent as most survival game films do. So, one season is good enough for me.,I never got to watch any series after Mind hunter and Kingdom that kept me hooked. The Squid Game hits off right from the Episode 1. The series deals with all the aspects of human emotions especially GREED! This show cant be missed at any cost. This series deserves 10/10.,Outstanding acting performance by ALL actors, so it looks realistic despite of the imaginary plot. People who hit rock bottom and have nothing to lose or that simply have no other choice take the very high risk of death hoping to win a kids game that will solve all their problems for good, or so they think. The only problem is that those who lose the game are killed immediately, so it\\'s actually a game of life and death. Makes you think about the horrible life of the poor, who suffers with no future, while the wealthy enjoy.,Overall I love the show. Great story, of the games. Few things I don\\'t like....the acting is sub par and feels scripted. And the main character, you wanna like the main character. And I don\\'t, he\\'s a sleazy Grambling addict who is really a piece of garbage. I dont care whether he makes it or not. And overall this show makes Koreans seem....cringy. Horrible people.,Loved this show, great story and idea. Though the acting is sub par. And up until the last 2 episodes you really want the main character to die. He was a gambling loser and then at the end he\\'s the only person left that you want to win. Honestly the girl should have won....and then! At the very end...instead of taking his winnings and leaving. He goes back to...Do what? No one knows.,It was very well acted . The male lead was excellent . I did figure out the main twist in the storyline , earlier on. I\\'m eagerly waiting for series 2 .I\\'ve watched South Korean movies for a number of years and have always enjoyed them .Their series Kingdom is fabulous too . Hollywood needs to learn from South Korea how to make good movies and series .,I am at the 3rd episode in a row! This is really entertaining in a good manner of modern Korean mystery dramas. Well done, usually I am quite skeptical about Netflix shows but this one is truly good one. Enjoy!,Solid drama with good story complexity and excellent character build up. Each episode is thrilling and heartwarming. Awesome series, one of the best series i have seen so far on netflix. Looking forward for Season 2.,It is violent, contains plenty of gratuitous blood and gore, and features some amazing set designs and decent performances. Like any good game, Squid Game keeps you hooked until you get to the finishing line. There are a few questionable sub-plots - for instance, the undercover police officer who does absolutely nothing to stop the game - but the overall story holds up. Korean entertainment is here to stay.,Masterpiece series\\r\\nI remember old days game where play in childhood memories\\r\\nI honey candy 🍭I recommend to watch atleast onceI waiting for more sessions.,Brilliant Korean interpretation of Hunger Games + Prison Break + many other clever shows. Culturally fascinating, edge of the seat sweaty hand watching. I love it !,I get the premise.. I get the idea.. I just don\\'t get the acting. You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times.. like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale.. it\\'s like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves\\' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one).. how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one.. I give it points for originality but I hated the characters. They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better.,A five for the main story a 1 for the ending, like people said it does try to somewhat act like \"SAW\" at some point.Also the subtitles was way off.If I had to watch again... I wouldn\\'t\\r\\nSome episodes was interesting, but most was not and like I said the ending was awful and doesn\\'t make sense.,The first couple of episodes a very well done and pack a punch, but by the end it just seems to run out of steam. The marbles episode was the last real swerve, after that it becomes paint by numbers to the point that I started fast forwarding through most of it just to get it to end.Early episodes are an eight, final episodes are a three.,It\\'s more than just a show or very strange idea from South Korea\\'s minds, slowly with the characters development there will be a lot of questions about life in general and especially about being a human or not... and this is the strength of the show, yes as lot of viewers I didn\\'t like that much the last 3 episodes mainly because of the introduction of some strangers...... otherwise it is a solid show.,What a amazing series from start to end ,really no words .best movie or serie regarding games .Korea took it in extream beauty level .so much lessons to learn by this series .I enjoyed more then money hesit season 3.4 and 5 .thx to Netflix showing or making series like that .hates off Korea and Netflix.,Hope find season two and dad Sang Woo actor who sweetheart as mean characters . Go hun will fight evil guy offers him in danger play in games if Squid Game. Make girl\\'s brother and Gi hun\\'s daughter had met each other. Upset Sangwoo killed off.,Good cast with a smart story. It\\'s somewhat overly violent for shock\\'s. If you pay attention to what\\'s happening during the episodes you can guess how it\\'s going to play out, and that\\'s quite rare these days . Overall really good but the last two episodes was a little weak imo. It\\'s seems that Koreans know how to entertain us, thank you !,I am the first to admit I\\'m a lazy movie watcher and am not big on dubbing foreign movies or subtitles so when I kept hearing about Squid Game I was hesitant.This movie was amazing and was such a well written and interesting story.I\\'ve seen others bag the VIPs and I agree that was the weakest point of the show but hard to fault anything else.Can\\'t wait for season 2.,I CAN\\'T UNDERSTAND THE HYPE ABOUT IT... IT IS NOT INNOVATIVE AND DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PERFORMANCES IT\\'S JUST THE KOREAN VERSION OF DEADLY GAMES (WHICH ALWAYS IS MILLIONS OF TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT),A hype is a hype is a hype... and our actual societys\\' Zeitgeist. The series is far away from the mentioned \"masterpiece\". Its starts very good, the first 3 parts are very enjoyable, but then it goes down quite quickly. Everything is far too obvious, from the beginning everything is so clear, not one single surprise to the end, and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline, the bad dialogues and the overacting. Furthermore full of plotholes, another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes. All in all nothing special.,The success of the movie, \"Parasite\" has given RPG film makers brain freeze. If South Korean filmmakers hate Capitalism so much, its a short trip to North Korea. Meanwhile, horrible over acting. Inconsistent internal logic. Full of plot holes. Non violent scenes are devoid of entertainment and violent scenes are repetitious and disgusting.,Everything is bad enough in Squid Game. But the most unbearable thing is to make us believe that this imaginary would not be ideological. But what we are shown is mostly a very bourgeois fantasy that man would be a wolf for man, that the game or the war allow to reinforce. Rancid and pathetic.,Everything boils down to bad guys in South Korea. They\\'re not Korean, or even Asian. They\\'re European Caucasians. Get that. The only white people in this whole series are cast as the irredeemable bad guys. I\\'m sure it\\'s just a coincidence.,Squid Game is such a successful show that presented one-of-a-kind filmmaking elements that were never seen before. From its unique story to its visually stunning shots, the show deserved everything it got.The show really presented a powerful dramatic topic in the most beautiful way. You constantly be asking yourself who is right and who is wrong?. You get to see the different emotional decisions that characters have to go through to either sacrifice their lives or defend and protect themselves.Really loved how the show manifests the different characters and the diversity between them. It doesn\\'t focus on one character, it rather focuses on around 7 different characters. You get to see the old, the young, the poor, the rich, the female, the male, and even the husband and wife. This makes the story even 10x better as we get to see everything and everyone\\'s decision and how they react to these different games.I feel like the show was better when it was mysterious. As soon as things started to get revealed to us, the show lost itself and that mysteriousness vibe that it was offering. But, at the same time if things kept being mysterious, then the questions would\\'ve never been answered so the show would\\'ve been even worse. The show had plot holes and things that just didn\\'t make sense at all. Like stupid decisions made by characters, or stupid character developments, or cheezy lines like the ones in \"English\" (and not Korean). Like why not keep everything in Korean?! Why do you have to add English dialogues and characters?!. But on the other hand, the show offered us many elements that covered these bad plot holes and made us not think about them as much as we think about the good stuff. For instance, the visually stunning set design with its beautiful colors that are matching perfectly together and with each game that they were playing especially they are meant to be for children so the bright pinky colors explain all of that. The custom designs as well alongside the masks gave that scary, suspense, and thriller atmosphere.The acting is beyond amazing. Each actor presented the dramatic side and life of their character perfectly and their acting plays a huge part in how we were easily connecting with each character. The acting of the VIPs was one of the worst things that I have ever seen.The show\\'s 9 episodes are written very beautifully and carefully. This is why they turned to be great. The 2nd episode with its amazing title, \"Hell\" explains every back story. Although it was a boring episode, without it the show would\\'ve literally been nothing and the characters would\\'ve meant nothing. Really loved how the show presented a specific character that was quiet and didn\\'t have any lines in the whole show except for one specific episode and we were easily connected emotionally to that character. It took the writer only one episode to make us connect deeply with the character that was quiet in previous episodes. That is enough to explain how each thing about this whole TV show was written with deep thinking and creativity.Finally, the beautiful music score is composed by Jung Jaeil, the same composer of Parasite (2019). You can hear the similarities between the two. Especially that both of them discuss such a sensitive and realistic topic which is greed, the difference between the poor and rich, and what people are willing to do for \"money\". The music score played an important role, especially in emotional scenes. They made these scenes way more emotional than they should be and added a lot of meaning to them.My rating is 8.5/10.,This isnt one of them. There were some great characters, but sadly, they were wiped out til only the dregs remained. They dregs weren\\'t much better than the English speaking vips that had to be the most poorly cast actors in the history of the universe. The end was fitting. Bleak. The movie was bleak. Bleak can be good, but there needs to be a point. There wasn\\'t one here. I cared not a lick about those that remained. This was a terrible waste.,The luckiest unlucky? The question, what does success mean to you? Just try to ask yourself after watching it. What a brilliant, dark, fun & fast paced show to demonstrate metaphor of capitalism. I would love to take this ride again. Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. The acting was pretty good and the story & plot was crazy. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality, honesty, sacrifice, smartness, cunningness and so on. Ending was somewhat predictable bht definitely a good show. I do recommend for you to watch it.,Starts off pretty well in the first episode. Then it\\'s just downhill and pointless. The ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crap\\r\\nIt turns out everything is dread, nothing has any meaning, and no one gets happy for anything. Doom, gloom and bad acting is all you get.,Great show with great twists. The only thing that I found bad was the VIP\\'s terrible acting.The only Korean show that I have watched and it was amazing.,Nessa analise me baseei em 5 importantes pontos: Enredo, desenvolvimento, personagens, estética e entretenimento.Enredo: 2/2\\r\\nDesenvolvimento: 1/2\\r\\nEstética: 2/2\\r\\nPersonagens: 1/2\\r\\nEntretenimento: 2/2.,What makes this show great, besides the amazing storyline and acting, is a glimpse into the Korean culture... and human nature. The human nature part is not a pretty sight, although we see the light in the darkness in some characters.,1. If you are a fan of Violence and Thrilling Elements then this movie is for you.2. Produced with Highest Budget\\r\\n3. No compromise on quality\\r\\n4. No Compromise of script execution\\r\\n5. Mix of Emotions, Action, Horror, Thriller. Spy and what else\\r\\n6. Keeps you engaged throughout.,Meh. Overrated. It keeps banging the same drum about what you\\'d do in a game if it was your life versus another\\'s life. It\\'s got a certain style, but the acting was amateurish and melodramatic. Sorta like anime.,What is going on here? How can this show be praised like it is? This series is positively garbage...It\\'s first degree from A to Z, the writing and acting are deplorable (oh the rotten discussions on the meaning of life!), the message distressingly banal, if not non-existent. Manichaeism in all its glory..The choice of music (Blue Danube from top to bottom) to emphasize the decadent atmosphere is pathetically heavy too. I really don\\'t understand what people can find in this interstellar piece of trash that looks like it was written and directed by an 8 year old child, considering how subtle is it.Nothing is credible, everything is predictable, the characters are caricatures (OMG, the \"VIPs\"...)What\\'s the so-called great political and social message? That people will do anything for money? That\\'s the great originality of the thing, seriously?I haven\\'t seen anything that ridiculous or grotesque for a long time.,One of the well-made, and original shows. The highlights: its writing, creative direction, Large and beautiful set design, character developments, and an uncovering of the truth of Humanity. Though it is not for faint-hearted people as it is brutal and disturbing in many ways still A masterpiece that every movie premyy should watch. Highly Recommended! ❤,My biggest problems was how main character has been portrayed. He was detestable. First 10 minutes of the show and I really, really, really wanted to punch the guy in the face and turn off the show.The show kinda uses dirty trick to make him less what he was portrayed as and more relatable. This effect was the strongest on 6th episode, Gganbu, which was also the best one out of all 9.In all honesty i had to force myself to watch first 3 episodes and they totally failed to hook me in. I only kept on watching because otherwise i\\'d feel like I wasted 3 hours for nothing. Sunk cost fallacy.I am kind of glad that I did. Kind of.At episode 5 things got slightly better. 6th was the best, the peak of the show and after that it was slow and weird fall. Yeah, episode 7, 8 and 9 were weird to say the least.The issues: The playgrounds and props look cheap. Director tried to imitate \\'hunger games\\'... things (episode 7 onwards) but... boy, oh boy.. It\\'s just bad. Fake blood was downright insulting.. While some scenes were brutally real. Like DUDE, decide. Want me to be grossed out with fake CGI blood stain, or puke my guts out?!The games are weird and some of them make little sense difficulty-wise, while others are made so unfair I just scratch my head \"what was the point other than playing SAW movie on us?\". Seriously some of those games a blender with nails and glass would be safer place than whatever they came up with.Ending, without any spoilers... Here\\'s the thing: Koreans to my knowledge LOVE unhappy/sad endings. It seems they just need to be beaten down emotionally. I seriously do not remember the last Korean movie that didn\\'t end up sad for the sake of sad. And because it\\'s a 9-episode long show, the \"sad ending\" phase is stretched quite a bit. Not gonna lie, I did feel like my eyes got teary, but it was annoying, rather than earned.Should you watch it... Did you like saw (and/or dont mind gore)? If so, go ahead. Do you have netflix? If so... eh, sure.I wish i could just tell you to watch episode 6.. but without knowing the characters and their relationship... Eh it\\'s either all or none case, sadly. I will definitely not bother with season 2 if we ever gonna get one.,The sereal started very interesting. You dont know why happening this, who is behind this, and what kind of child game thay will play. But after episode 7 when the vip-s arrived, the whole concept are turnd up side down. All the serial become predictible, like im feeling my self as a precog. Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever. That makes from 8 star to 7. But is still a good seral. A new type of battle royale. But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived. Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star. And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting.,The first episodes hit you like a hard punch in the stomach. Original and well produced series. Disturbing, bizarre and unpredictable. Many very good characters with the big exception of the VIP people that were very bad acting. Korean filmmakers show more and more their ability to make high quality dramas. You are kept on the edge of your seat for the first half of the series. Then it loses some steam and focus. The ending a bit disappointing and the opening for a second seasons feels totally unncessary. One season is enough and it is a very good watch for the not-faint-hearted-viewers.,As in the title says, this show is great. Already people made detailed comments and I won\\'t have anything futher to add. But I\\'d like to point out two things.First one is complaints about predictability. I strongly disagree that view. Until the last second of the game, you\\'ll be wondering who is going to be the winner. Because the balance between characters is consistenly changing thanks to great storytelling and it makes you reconsider who deserves to win during the entire show.Second thing is apparently people annoyed by the performances of VIP actors. It\\'s true, VIP actors are really b type movie actors yet they have very short amount of screen time. Therefore it doesn\\'t affect the overall experience in my opinion. If you\\'re a person who has watched many other asian productions like me, it won\\'t be a problem at all. Whenever a British or American actor is being seen on Asian movies (both chinese and Korean), you\\'ll find their performance laughable anyways. Actors here reminds me IP Man 2. Regardless this is not a serious issue to lean on.In short, don\\'t miss it out and believe the hype. Definitely deserves to watch.,So dumb. I don\\'t understand all the hype. I could only watch this with one finger on the Fast Forward button.And now i have to come up with 150 characters to complete this review.,Hwang Dong-hyuk\\'s thrilling, hyper-violent, unique Korean TV series steaming now on Netflix is one of the most original and gripping shows ever produced for the medium. Taking place in South Korea, it concerns people who are in serious financial ruin that receive a mysterious invitation to compete in a series of children\\'s game at a secret location that could earn the sole winner the ultimate prize of millions of dollars in cash, but the catch is you have a certain amount of time to succeed, and the losers are brutally executed on the spot. The series\\' lead protagonists are Seong, sensationally played by Lee Jung-Jae, a divorce gambling addict with a lovely young daughter who is in deep debt to some vicious loan sharks, his childhood friend Cho Sang-woo, superbly played by Park Hae-soo, who was the golden boy of the neighborhood that went to a prestigious business university, and now his wanted by the police for embezzling great sums of money from clients of the company he worked for, a beautiful young pickpocket named Kang Sae-byeok, impressively played by Jung Hoyeon, who needs the money for her baby brother who is in an orphanage, a Pakistani migrant worker, Ali Adul, terrifically played by Anupam Tripathi, who is on the run and is desperate for money to support his infant child and beloved wife, a sickly old man, Oh ll-nam, endearingly played by Oh Yeong-su, who has nothing to lose, and a murderous criminal, Jang Deok-su, memorably played by Heo Sung-tae, who is on the run from killer gangsters. Marvelously directed by Dong-hyuk, it has a truly engrossing screenplay by Hwang Dong-hyuk, stunning cinematography by Lee hyeong-Deok, and incredibles sets. This highly addictive show had me and my dear wife on the edge of our seats, the suspense is almost unbearable at times. We cannot want for season two to get here. Highly recommended.,I really enjoyed this show. There are some weak moments, too much explanatory dialogue, the acting can get pretty cheesy a few times, but overall it\\'s fantastic. I loved the ending, too, not sure why so many people seem to dislike it.,Hands down superb, if you aren\\'t a fan, then you aren\\'t a fan of Korean cinema. And you most likely watched this with English subs because of social media\\'s hype. Go back to gavin and Stacey if that\\'s the case.,Terrible voice actor in the main character. Childish. Stopped watching. Subtitles are better.,There\\'s a lot to compare with Squid Game, because there are some obvious similarities to Battle Royale but different enough.The good: the contestants are fantastic, the script, and acting are first rate and it\\'s impossible not to get attached. I like the simplicity of it: people want money, they compete in deadly games to get it. There are opportunities to leave, but the need for all that money is greater than risking their life. The bases are pretty well covered. Visually it\\'s like a demented Dr Seuss story. Loved the sets!The bad (or, the picky): the VIP\\'s are stupid with horrible acting, everything the rest of the show isn\\'t. The surprise ending is cool, but the explanation is pretty lacking for a show with tons of detail. I guess they can use season 2 for this. As a stand-alone you have to just accept that someone has the money and imagination to put together such an elaborate and secretive series of games for the benefit of a few bored rich people. And the workers? No explanation how the control is there at all.,Anwar Says : Last week, there was absolutely nothing to watch on Hindi OTT and I decided to go for much talked about Squid Game on Netflix, a Korean dark and disturbing series. 9 long episodes and would force you for a binge watch.You have everything in the plot , childhood games , killing, inhumanity, hatred , emotions, sentiments , and above all mind game . Out of 456 contestants, all down with debts are ready to sacrifice their lives to earn money, sounds a familiar subject but the Netflix team has converted it to unnerving deadly battle.Premise is simple and the characters are introduced quite fast but smoothly. If you loose you are killed and your guessing is not correct every time. Don\\'t want to be a spoiler, so not narrating the story and the games .The lead Lee Jung- Jae gets answers to all his questions in the last episode.Watch the series with sub- titles on , in spite of the fact the dubbing in English is of quality par excellence . The masked jump- suits used by the guards are going to be the favourite this Halloween . Already running at top spot since a fortnight.9 out of 10 from me .#Nerflix\\r\\n#anwarsays\\r\\n#SquidGame\\r\\n#koreanseries\\r\\n#LeeJungJae\\r\\n#review\\r\\n#webseries\\r\\n#childhoodgames.,A battle royale-style concept that\\'s been done many times in different forms (e.g., Alice in Borderland, 3%, Hunger Games, etc.), but there\\'s just something in the way that Korean artistic style makes even the most cliched story lines interesting again. The first episode felt a little sluggish, but gets going by the end, and boy does it get going!The show is thoroughly enjoyable and gripping to watch, but gets predictable towards the end. Not only that, I think the writers ran out of shocking novel ideas about how to stage the namesake game in the end. But by then, you may just appreciate the relief of a straight-forward conclusion.Definitely binge-worthy! Though they could make a sequel/season 2, I don\\'t think they should--it doesn\\'t really need it, nor leaves you wanting more.,What a Beautiful show this was!.. It\\'ll make you think about yourself, the people, life & everything else that \\'matters\\'.. &🥂Cheers to everyone involved in this amazing show you all did a really amazing job Everything was just Top Notch!🎭✨Negatives : 1. A bit predictable but still i was\\r\\nhooked.2. The dialogues (& acting) of VIPs\\r\\nwas cringe.I\\'ve seen so many movies & shows from South Korea & they never disappoint do they!?P. S. For the haters - \\'Hating on popular things doesn\\'t make you a cool or interesting person\\' XD.,How is this currently on a score of 8.2? The lead character was SO annoying in the first 30 minutes that I switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through.It\\'s not a patch on either Battle Royale or the American version of that, Hunger Games.It drags on and on and on, and the ending is just flat.Watch it if you must because of the binge/hype value, but it has little to offer any serious film buff.,Everyone gave their best except for the VIPS.Great series to watch\\r\\nHats off to the director!,TV made for violent lowbrows. Parasite was rubbish, this is even worse.,The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time. It sure knows how to play around with the viewer\\'s emotions. It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways.Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you.Great Character development - CheckPerfect Casting - CheckPerfect screenplay and progression - CheckA brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices.And that\\'s what the show is all about. The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world.I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions.,It seems to me that too many Humans with not much of the grey matter are such Gullible People getting excited about this absolute Rubbish.Try getting outside a bit more People????,...and I couldn\\'t even finish it.Maybe it gets good; I don\\'t know, as it has so much hype and good reviews.I just know it\\'s not for me.The main character is so unlikeable that I don\\'t care what happens to him. Maybe he grows as a character...he probably does, but I don\\'t care enough to stick around to see.The acting is over the top. The main character pulls faces every two minutes. I\\'ve seen better acting in high school plays, but maybe a lot is missing in the translation.If I ever watch the rest I\\'ll come back and write a better review but for now, this is a hard pass.,No spoiler here, just a recommendation. In my mind it\\'s only 8 episodes long. Episode 8 is short, so just add 20 mins of episode 9 on top of it, and stop at the moment it says \"X amount of time later!\" Nothing else worth your time after then, the next 40 minutes serves to be quite damaging, as far as the story is concerned. The end point I recomend is really appropriate. Well, go past that point, but just pretend that segment is part of a bad dream!,Saw films, Gantz anime, Alice In Borderland tv series, High Rise Invasion manga, and more have done this formula. Some of which have done this formula better.The only thing that Squid Game adds new, is that it is South Korea\\'s own take on it, with a kdrama spin.At max, this is a 6 star at best, and a 2 star at its\\' worst. I\\'m just not as entertained, compared to other kdramas and survival game narratives (as listed above).,I seriously don\\'t know what the hype is all about. Is it because people get killed while playing a game? Is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey? Because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better.To me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long.,The production was done quite well. Love the direction. Cinematography was on point. Actors did a good job. That being said the story really starts to take a turn for the worst towards the end. Branched storylines resulted in dead ends. The failed attempt at trying to be artistic and deep was quite cringe worthy in the finale. Would i watch S2? 50/50.,Honestly Netflix can not make many good American shows without a bunch of woke politics and other trash. This show is god damn amazing!!! Its so dark and twisted.,09/12/2021,\\r\\nNetflixI was meaning to watch the squid game for days due to the insane hype it created here at my place. I always expected it to be a sort of highly intelligent game show kind of film but when I finally sat watching the first episode, I definitely know it is going to be another parasite.Again, I don\\'t hate parasite, in the same way, I don\\'t hate this series. Squid game had a good pace with it, not once I felt bored and I really admired the effort that these film makers have put in to the show but, BUT, the series, same as the film, was insanely dark, disturbing and hopeless.I mean, why do you have to create such series and pour in more negativity into this world? Don\\'t you have enough? I think this is the problem with not only this but most of the Korean films/dramas, called to be \\'thrillers\\' these days and the fact that these inhumane shows get widespread acclaim is horrifying and making me question the future of this world.Judgements aside, the series also had major flaws like crappy characters, predictable tale telling and confusing logic. At times, you cannot find motives for a character\\'s action at all. Some characters had no back story, no arc, no depth, even though they were prioritized over other disposable characters.I mean, do these people ever think what will happen if they get killed? With what hope, they are entering the game show? What are the odds\\' of having multiple winners? Did they really choose to return even after watching a bloody massacre in front of their eyes? Did they really think that these people can be trusted after watching that?Coming to the male lead, Who leaves their sick mom for days/months to play a dangerous game in the hopes of winning money and returns hoping that she would be alive? What are the chances of winning the game (1 out of 456)? Did they really think they will have multiple winners? Which game has that?Do any of these characters live for themselves? If the characters are so sentimental towards their loved ones, why risk their own lives in the first place? Would the loved ones think that the money is better than the loss of their children/parents?Why did the female lead leave her only brother to play the game when she had no debts? She could have lead a good life here in South Korea making peace with her mind that she cannot see her mom again. Did she really think that her mom would be happy after coming to SK and to know that her only daughter is dead? What were the odds that after the escape, her mom would still be left alive in NK? Did she put her entire life in danger, trusting on some blind instincts?Now that I think of this series, there were so many things that didn\\'t make sense or plainly were there to psychologically torture the characters. The series, as parasite did, left my heart with a hollow and I\\'m stressed out. Like life is not stressful enough.I\\'m alarmed at the ratings that this weak show has been given and seriously feel frightened of this sadist community, who I know will not dare to kill anyone if the dystopian future arrives. I\\'ll rather take my own life than to play a people killing game like this.,I hate Netflix with all my soul, but was surprised by the superb concepts and style of Squid Game, with human, complex characters, and plot. I can honestly say I found the show brilliant at times, with honest, raw emotion present, intertwined with unflinching violence, and more than capable actors turning in poignant and nuanced performances. I loved it. Until the very last episode. The pacing was off, multiple twists that just didn\\'t seem to fit, and just a tone and feel that felt way off after 8 episodes. I would have given this a 9 or maybe even a 10 if the final episode had been..more fitting. I still give it a solid 8/10. Great show.,There was a new Korean series on Netflix and I didn\\'t really care. But it didn\\'t take long before I started hearing about it from all sides, and only in a good way. So I decided to watch this series and I don\\'t regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn\\'t take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children\\'s games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn\\'t anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it.,I have no complaints about the story of Squid Game or the violence and gore in the story, it\\'s actually done rather tactfully throughout, showing just enough here and there to make it worthwhile and fun to watch.The acting is top form in all respects, every portrayal is perfect and heart-wrenching in places in both how perfectly its shown and how decent it\\'s made .Even the sets are painstakingly jarring and off-putting, that. \"relativity\" style primary colour hallway set is so jarringly off-putting and decently alluring at the same time, I knew on first seeing it that I\\'d love the set decoration and propworks.So why after all this gushing for how wonderfully amazing this is am I not giving it a 10/10?Because I want this series to be literally just this, a 9 episode story of a down-on-his-luck man with decent ambitions who goes through hell only to come out on the other side as a hero.But that ending man, that ending...the sequel bait in it is thick as 10 week in the snow syrup. And I don\\'t want that, I don\\'t want Gi-hun to become some warrior trying to take down the international Squid Game people. Let this be the amazing single season it is that shows even the lowest man can become something amazing when given the chance.,Ok..it\\'s entertaining for sure...but plot wise it does not make sense..at the end ( spoilers). It\\'s about how can they treat people the way they do.. forgetting the fact the contestants chose to be there and could leave anytime they liked..they knew the rules and decided to play ..so why the suddeb blame on the host of the games?..all in all it\\'s fun.. expect a few remakes from bigger better film studios..,Regardless of the plot, subject matter, etc, this was overall some of thee best acting I\\'ve ever seen. Keep in mind I\\'m disregarding the VIPs lol. But this movie is making me feel things I absolutely did not expect at all going into this, lol. I feel \"truth\" from almost every main cast member. Honestly, it\\'s a brilliant performance and, if it were a movie and shot to be a movie, I\\'d see it making waves in American mainstream similar to Train to Busan. A+++ to the actors, wow, the character arcs in this are awesome to watch.,I watched two episodes and I had enough. There\\'s nothing here, terrible acting, unoriginal concept (I\\'ve seen a half dozen movies that resemble this series). I honestly do not understand what the hype is about, the only thing I can guess is that the producers and Netflix paid a huge amount of money to market this show. I see a LOT of Stanley Kubrik wanna be here, from the masks (Eyes Wide Shut), the music (On the Beautiful Blue Danube) the surrealism (The Shining), the gore (A Clockwork Orange), and there is nothing wrong with being influenced or even try to imitate art, however this series is simply too weak and Kubrik\\'s imitation is a failure in my opinion. If anyone is impressed by this then they must be watching reality TV all day long.,There\\'s a lot of blood and violence in my opinion. I often wonder which is the more accurate one. Does blood gush out if a bullet pierces a person and how much. Is it like tiny not visible droplets that couldn\\'t be caught on camera and then there\\'s blood pouring from the wound I doubt it\\'s a splatter fest.The social commentary was elsewhere too but I found the voting scene most fascinating. How half of the players wanted to get the money and risk their life. I get that many of the players were desperate but can\\'t these people get even a litt paying job rather than play in the squid game. I\\'ll rather work at a McDonald\\'s than risk my life.,I feel conflicted after finishing the series. After watching the 3rd episode I was hooked! Just absolutely amazing! A solid 10! I\\'m glad there were only 9 episodes. At this moment I\\'m not sure exactly when it started going wrong. I agree with others, the VIPs were awful and cliche. And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn\\'t sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don\\'t understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn\\'t yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn\\'t work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang\\'s brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead \\'Big Bad\\'s\\' Mother! THEN it looks like he\\'s going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I\\'m headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I\\'d feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh.,If you liked any Black Mirror episode, imagine this series is 10 times better. Perversion, simplicity, emotion, action and drama, all in 1 package. A must watch.,It was an ok watch to start with but then each episode just dragged and dragged on making it quite drawn out and boring. Should have made it into a 5/6 episode series. Doubt i\\'ll watch another series if they make one.,Answer: Do not know. Binged through the 9 episodes .Mixed feelings mixed opinions , mixed reactions,\\r\\nExcessively brutal and violent yet all the brutality and violence hides a hidden agenda for everyone to interpret as he/she wishes. As I watched the English dubbed version with Hebrew subtitles I can only say that the subtitles often differed from the dubbed English ,hence i believe that the translated subtitles are more close to the original Korean version that the dubbing. The main character actors give a reasonable performance while some others should keep their day jobs.So is it worth watching?-See the Subject line. I would rate it 0/10 and 8/10 at the same time. Hence I am giving it a 4.,I don\\'t watch many foreign shows or movies, but with all the popularity surrounding this show I just had to watch it. \"Squid Game\" is a very engaging show that keeps you hooked in with its various twists and surprises that keep you watching. While the last episode failed to satisfy some aspects of the series, it still wrapped things up nicely and did a great job of showing the consequences of a society were the rich are the only ones who benefit. Very excited for season two.,An excellent series on the critique of capitalism and money worship in the world and the current world of Korea (South). The series clearly challenges capitalist society, saying that the poor (participants here) are the slaves of the rich (here the game makers). As the main character clearly says somewhere: \"You (the poor) bet on the horses and we (the rich) bet on you! You are our horses! The main goal of the series is the critique of capitalism in the form of these.\" Fascinating, exciting and breathtaking matches that managed to reach their goal well and become the most watched series in the history of Netflix to date, which is true, I suggest you watch it.,It\\'s really nice esthetically pleasing. But you have to like testosterone movies sadistic and so on . So yes Pasolini did better with.salo 120 days of salo ..\\r\\nBut new generation forgot about this....,It becomes one of successfully Korean dramas. Besides the brutal element, the setting of each game involves lot of tactics, eg composition of the team, your partner, sequence etc.. which determine your success rate. There is nothing relevant to distasteful Saw game! Plus all of them participate in the game on a voluntary basis!Another thing I like most is about character development. All main characters\\' acting are excellent, and the supporting roles like snake tattoo, Pakistan contestants are also competent. It reminds me of Busanhaeng! However, these foreigners VIP acting are so embarrassing.Just a bit strange. Gi-Hoon personality setting difference before and after participating in the game is too much. In the past, he was kind of greedy gambler. However he suddenly ends up like a superhero with full of truth and justice. If you don\\'t want to use the money, it\\'s better to donate it. So comparatively Sang-Woo character is more consistent. All in all, I did enjoy it from the beginning till the end.,I enjoyed this show it was very interesting to see. This show was intense from start to finish. First, of all the first episode with the red light green light game caught my attention. I had no idea anyone was going to play it with guns so that was wild. Second, camera angles were dope, however shaky camera work some scenes. I also loved the acting and the character development and attachment came so easy with this show. Finally, I loved the story of this show and connections and betrayals. This show was relatable and shows how society in the long run will look out for their own interests while there is still a few good things about humanity as well. Thank you for the show.,Honestly, i skipped the story of the player\\'s background. But when the game began to play with all the gripping game stage, its excited me. This serial is a mix between the Hunger Games and Saw. You\\'ll never expect whose the boss of all deadly games, if you already watched Saw movies, then you\\'ll know.,If you are wondering if this show is worth of all the hype, it is.Just a few flaws for me: the cop sub plot feels silly; and as usually in korean dramas, when they need white characters (the VIPs here - by the way, could you imagine a US show were all the villains would be POC?) they cast the same bunch of untalented dudes. Their acting is so bad that i really wonder if they are truly actors or if there are just white dudes livng in Korea.,\"Squid Game\" is one of the best Netflix shows to come out in a long time. It\\'s a truly twisted yet inventive show filled with amazing performances and terrifying situations.This show truly kept me engaged throughout all its 9 episodes. The characters are absolutely amazing. Each character is truly fleshed out in their own ways making you care about some yet hate others. The acting is amazing. Each actor gives a commented, realistic, and terrified performance, and it feels real. The games too are very fun to watch. Some are quick and fast, while others are slow and terrifying. It\\'s a very inventive premise for a show. Also the show truly made me cry. It\\'s a show that succeeds at making you love characters too much. And that will result in you crying at certain things that happen in the show. The show also just has a real look at what it\\'s like living in debt. It\\'s makes you think whether it\\'s worth it to risk your life to get money.I have but ONE little issue with the show. The first 2 episodes are just a little slow. I feel that they could\\'ve been better paced, but that\\'s it.\"Squid Game\" is a truly amazing show that has amazing performances, fleshed out characters, a real look at reality, and a premise that\\'s so creative that it\\'s almost impossible to enjoy.,I think this series is great and different experience for all the entertainment lovers.. Only lacks at emotional elements cause i think it would be great if they develop more moments..\\r\\nOtherwise this is entertaining at many portions.. Stretched at some portions.. Thrilling at time.. Horror in elements and emotional in parts!!,The main characters are all unlikable, in the extreme. And all the acting is terrible, and voice acting in translation somehow even worse.I have no idea how this became a success.,When you watch S01E06 (\"Gganbu\"), make sure you have a box of tissues next to you... and preferably also somebody to hug.,Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It\\'s basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It\\'s basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much \"micromanagement\" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it\\'s really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the \"micromanagement\" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot.,This show shows us the hypocrite nature of humans and how they can turn into monsters when the things come to money & self life.But at some instances the plot was predictable like in E2 (voting stops at 100-100 and the last man will decide the result), the front man turns to be the police officers brother and the last episode ended at such an anti-climatic note (sang woo kills himself for what? After returning from game Gi hun forgets about his daughter for whom he wants to be a good father),Overrall it is a good show and the only concern i had was the acting it felt so cringy and annoying at the same time and i skipped so many scenes bcz of very poor acting.,I\\'ve watched a ton of Korean series and films and to say this was good is overstating.The premise, the storylines are nothing new, it\\'s been done a lot over the years.Just has more CGI Bells and Whistles.Sorry, but I can\\'t recommend this slop.Easy to figure out that The Front Man was the cop\\'s brother...\\r\\nLots of blood and headshots...\\r\\nI was stunned that the bathroom sex scene was there...\\r\\nNone of the characters made you actually like them or pull for them...\\r\\nIf they make another season...that\\'s punishment enough.,I loved everything about this show, very engaging and stressful, yet it depicts human emotions to the fullest. Gambling on a horse race will never feel that easy anymore.,Great show. Brilliant acting. Apart from the VIPs who thankfully had a small part otherwise they could have overshadowed a fantastic show. The bureaus are great screenwriters and I hope this introduces people to the brilliance of Korean filmmaking (start with Train to Busan!),I found this drama to be well executed and entertaining.Were there bad plot holes?Yes.Did the VIPs episode suck?Yes.But did that hinder the overall series?No.Because, this drama, despite its gruesome violence, is pretty light. It doesn\\'t have a deeper message nor a plot that makes you stop and think a lot. At one point, it\\'s just a game and you even stop feeling for whoever that dies.Pros:\\r\\nGood actingThe childish games with a twist were funLight plot, easy to follow.Uncomplicated charactersStellar castCons:\\r\\nVIPs episodePoliceman\\'s story line, how he gets into a highly secured center being undetected was unrealistic, also how come his phone battery lasted for 6 days without dying?Characters did not have much depth (except for the girls and Ali)Anyway, I have been watching kdrama for a while now, and I should say Squid Game is not the best kdrama I have seen. But it definitely is not the worst. It\\'s a fun ride. With awesome OSTs and BGs. Everyone should check this out.,Squid Game deserves its hype overall but is still marred by glaring inconsistencies and poor story-telling. One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it. It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning. Seven more things that compromise the story are:1. The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below. Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game.2. The Front Man is Jun Ho\\'s missing older brother. You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent. Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?3. With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?4. A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game. Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo. Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself. This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead. What an anticlimax.5. Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor\\'s guilt, leaving Sang Woo\\'s mom saddled with her son\\'s debt and Sae Byeok\\'s brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year.6. Squid Game started in 1988. Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows. Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters.7. The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America. Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games. How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like. If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator. End scene. Better set-up for season 2 instead of some irresponsible father letting his kid down again.,Very original, very strange. I like strange. Ooh look at this, it is so cute and harmless like a puppy until it bites off your index finger.,Good idea and first episode but by episode 4 i\\'d had enough. Too weird, violent and unlikeable characters.,Absolutely brilliant! Loved it from start to finish, excellent acting (apart from the American actors at the end! Dreadful) Great story, had me hooked.. binged watched the lot!Looks like they\\'ll be a second series which I can\\'t wait to see! Superb.,I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I\\'m guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor\\'s mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue).,First off, if you are starting this show, please give it the respect it deserves and watch the original Korean version with the English subtitles. A lot of people can be incredibly lazy when it comes to foreign films/TV shows. Avoid the American dubbed version like the plague. Now, onto the shoe itself which was an absolute blast from start to finish. Believe the hype, it genuinely is that brilliant and the acting is on point. The characters are very well developed and you start to grow to like certain characters as the series unfolds. It\\'s over the top violence and a little far fetched, but you are watching a TV series for entertainment, not to be educated. For all the 1* reviews. Ignore them. These are people that deliberately don\\'t rate a show because it\\'s popular and trend. Yes, it can be annoying when a show suddenly becomes huge and everyone jumps on the bandwagon, but don\\'t let that put you off. It\\'s one of the best series Netflix has produced in years. Highly recommended.,This show has a great script, excellent actors, but fails to keep the viewers interested, because it is really slow. I often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer, adding very little to the plot. This show could easily have 6 episodes, and that would improve a lot its entertaining value.,I don\\'t get why people love it. Simply put it\\'s saw but these people are willing to risk death. The over acting is annoying and not sure what the actual words are but the English dub is painful and out of touch with what is going on in the movie.,The show, for the most part, was good. A few dinky plot holes but I can live with that. The characters, however, are not good people nor are they redeemable. Normally, no likable characters completely kills a show for me. Alas, it\\'s hooked me in enough I want to see where the story goes from here. So I guess they won.,Pros: acting, art direction, visuals, detailed storytelling\\r\\nCons: filler scenesWith more than a decade in making, Director Hwang Dong-hyuk has nailed this series, possibly allowing for more Korean creators to explore this genre.The acting by many of the characters in the show has been phenomenal. Their backstories were believable and emotional because of the emotions they conveyed (if being watched with original Korean audio + English subtitles, instead of English dub).The artistic design throughout the movie was aesthetically pleasing and creative as color choices in many scenes are intentionally done. And with that being said, the attention to detail carries this show beautifully.The only complaints while watching were the filler scenes; making the show feel as though it\\'s dragging at some points. Some complained about the acting of the VIPs, but I think that was intentionally done by the creators.,What\\'s with all the hype??My biggest problem with this are the characters. I just don\\'t care for them, very two dimensional and not very well drawn.The concept is nothing ground breaking. Seen it done before and better. Also don\\'t bother with the dubbed audio, you\\'ll end up laughing.Found myself bored in quite a few of the episodes also.Overall, I just didn\\'t care, not the worst thing I\\'ve ever seen but nowhere\\'s near worthy of the hype it received.,Sure, it\\'s a complete rip-off of a Japanese classic movie but it\\'s still one of the most imaginative and visually stunning shows this year.Love it.Watch it!,It\\'s hard to understand the killing by numbers appeal - it\\'s expressive and shocking and bizarre, but mass-murder is mass-murder. Whatever the plot, it\\'s just unnecessary and fairly uninventive after first shot - once you understand the game rules and one person breaks them and gets shot, the rest is the same dull murderous routine for another 5 minutes.At the same time it\\'s hard to sympathise thieves and gamblers - their lifestyle is by no means a death verdict, but they\\'re not a relatable bunch either. Plus the acting is terrible, maybe save the old man, the Indian guy and the masked folks as long as they\\'re wearing the masks.Cinematography good though, and maybe there\\'s a great reveal up ahead - but I\\'m very reluctant to go past episode 3 for the reasons above.,As we enter I don\\'t know the 10th lockdown in my country thanks to the coronavirus and its variants dropping sequels and prequels every so often I finally decided to check it out and see what the hype is about.Literally finished the show start to finish ! Edge of the seat type of show.The plot itself is simple but the direction the screenplay and the casting ..mind blowing !,It is worth watching.The first season was awesome. Interesting concept. The problem is, that a lot of it is predictable.,5th episode is in, so far I haven\\'t seen a higher level of violence and gore that I was expecting to see. It\\'s a survival game genre TV show, but it hasn\\'t been living up to its premise yet. Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It\\'s simply because people can\\'t understand what\\'s going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary. One more thing, it was really nice to see an indian actor as one of the main characters in the show. I know It\\'s not a lot, but still it adds a lot of positive effects in the show.,Nothing more than a Korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc. Terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes.Probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy, Anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time.,This show isn\\'t as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. It\\'s definitely entertaining to watch, but it doesn\\'t have any more substance to it than that. Maybe because I\\'ve watched this after the \"raging hype\", but I personally don\\'t think this is a new concept at all.The acting is decent and it\\'s filmed well, but my rating went down from 7 to 6, due to the explanation we\\'re given as to why the games exist in the first place.Perhaps a lot of the viewers haven\\'t seen Battle Royal and generation Z have only just discovered violent asian cinema.,What\\'s Good- Yes, concept and plot of this survival drama is not a new thing, but the way it conveys with conviction has no match.It is high intense drama of human emotions like fear, greed, worrying, anxiety and humanity. Like in \\'parasite\\', it again shows social inequality issues of South Korea.The series is a high-quality work and It\\'s visuals are strong to build suspense very effectively.Recommending to watch original Korean audio with English subtitles. And yes, it can be addictive one to binge watch!,The show is a must watch. Would have made it a 10 were it not for the VIPs. I don\\'t understand why they came into the show so late. You figure they would have liked to see it from the beginning to quench their thirst for seeing people suffer but they didn\\'t. They should have just cut them out of the script. Otherwise an excellent series.,1-6 built strong momentum.Ep 7 brought in talkative bad English speaking actors that completely killed the mystery and the momentum the show was building. The show would have been smarter to keep them all silent and have them look tough and mysterious. The moment they started opening their mouths and started walking, they looked and sounded like average American Joes with average intelligence and an average strut. The show died there.Ep 8 Predictable progression, predictable ending, boring.Ep 9 total waste of time. Just drags on for too long.,This series has a really good storyline.You think you know how an episode goes. But it always takes a different turn.It has been very well thought out.Well done and i would say check it out!,I saw this drama cause I am a Kdrama lover .But it was not for me. From the first till the last episode was reproduced violence in every way. Sexual, verbal ,physical, just plain, coarse ,cruel and bloody-minded violence. Absolutely not reccomended to everyone under the age of 18.Regarding the plot , there was some parts with no reason. For example the whole story about the policeman was just unnecessary as he was not involved with the main characters.In my opinion only the last episode tried to \"save\" the whole disturbing face of the drama showing a more human side , and giving the moral message that money don\\'t bring happiness.,One would think that a miniseries centered around a gameshow would be stale after a while, but this series is top notch. I did think some elements of the story were hard to grasp, however the show was suspenseful and included an interesting range of characters.The only downside for me was the finale. I would have expected more character development from GiHun.,If you liked Alice in Borderland then this is a good bet! Likable (well most of them) characters, suspenseful and just a fun concept in general.,Good theme, but story developed in a bad way. POOR DIRECTION\\r\\nIdle for 2hr movie release than that of an 9episode series.,Pros\\r\\n* interesting premise\\r\\n* atmospheric\\r\\n* some of the acting is very well done\\r\\n* some character development is well doneCons\\r\\n* character personalities change at random\\r\\n* some over the top acting\\r\\n* some overly stereotypical characters\\r\\n* premise doesn\\'t have any real foundation\\r\\n* it ignores the potential sociocultural insightPros\\r\\nThe story underneath it all is an interesting one. The same general idea isn\\'t a unique one (eg. It\\'s similar to Brazil\\'s \"3%\"), but the my build in enough sub-plots, mystery, and kind of cliffhanger endings, for it to have a fair bit of intrigue.The setting also works. Real life scenes in the city are mostly either dark or grey, contrasting with the childlike bright colours and symbols of the games. It\\'s definitely quirky and somewhat atmospheric.Cons\\r\\nBut that\\'s all let down by some weak acting, annoying voice actor in the English dubbed version, and characters either who are too stereotypical or whose personalities change in a whim.There\\'s some decent acting and character development as well, but it\\'s way overdone (exaggerated facial expressions and \\'tantrums\\') by the main character and a several of the stereotypical ones are where the acting is really overdone.By the end, when they start revealing the motivations behind it all;m, it gets pretty weak, stereotypical (again), and exaggerated.In addition to this, there\\'s so much potential for a political or sociocultural commentary. So much scope to address the changes in kids habits (from active and interactive physical and outdoor games and the creativity of making up new ones, to iPad and PC screens all day long). And more so, to address the poor dying and struggling to survive to make money that for most is never actually within their grasp, while the rich do nothing but exploit them. (The latter is what \"3%\" does really well). But the dialogue doesn\\'t really touch on the issues at all. More focus on blood and guts than on any potential insight.Overall, too many characters make no sense, and it ultimately feels hollow in the end.,Literally gave this a 9/10 all because of how intensely obsessed i am with 067 and 240. That\\'s it and that\\'s all.,First I hate not having the option of listening in the original language with English subtitles. No option other than dubbing...my absolute least favorite way to watch. Now, the acting, or rather overacting big time. The main protagonist is an absolute waste of space and acts like Jerry Lewis on acid! The overacting and drivel dialogue makes it a ZERO, but not possible here.,Absolutely amazing show. The plot is not predictable which I find very intriguing. Kudos to the creators because this show, it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society. Not only does this show keep you hooked, but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole. With all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one I\\'ve seen to date. There are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all I highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you. It\\'s much needed perspective growth that more people should delve into.,Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone\\'s struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!,This show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what I think about it, I did so. It isn\\'t very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it\\'s a good choice. That\\'s what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. Sure, it\\'s a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. This doesn\\'t mean they don\\'t need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. I don\\'t expect a good reason for why the police don\\'t get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don\\'t care when a poor man\\'s account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.For starters what kind of a game doesn\\'t let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. This wouldn\\'t have happened if they were told elimination means death. It doesn\\'t matter if we the audience knew it was. The characters in game didn\\'t. When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren\\'t told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.Also you can\\'t have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. They are killed at random. The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don\\'t matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. It all falls flat on its face because it\\'s too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. Losing didn\\'t mean death and you could retry to play. Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. As such it\\'s nothing special in the longrun.,I caught this on Netflix and it was a phenomenal series! I wasn\\'t even sure I would like it but I ended up loving it! This is a creative storyline that gets pretty twisted but they were still able to add in some real sentimental parts that were surprising. Also has some mind blowing twists in it. Be prepared episode 6 is a rough one. I couldn\\'t believe how much you end up liking certain characters so when those certain ones were eliminated it gets really upsetting.This ended where they could do another season so I looked it up to see if there were plans for it but there isn\\'t yet. I read the director actually wrote every episode himself on top of directing it. He said if he does do another season he would use a writers table asks other seasoned directors.Do not miss out on this series!,It\\'s been done - and it\\'s been done in better ways. See The Running Man, or Escape from LA. This is teenage waffle trying to appeal to the phone obsessed fickle morals of a younger generation. In that regard it has succeeded.It is essentially a children\\'s programme with the gore not even being that graphic too. Mix that in with a massively predictable and immature plot (the old man was obviously behind it all) and a \"Luke I am your brother\" Star Wars re-hash crossover (complete with Darth Vader type villain) and mix that with a bit of The Hunger Games and you get this.The moral side of it is warped too and the main characters - nay, all of the characters remain very unlikeable, annoying and unrelatable. When he dyed his hair green at the end, I knew this was also trying to appeal to the overly geeky anime teens by attempting to create a cool anti hero that could be replicated at the next comic cons.Overrated.,Squid Game has a very high body count, and lots of gore to go with it. But even while the blood is spattering, the focus is on the characters, their relationships with each other, and the mysteries they\\'re unraveling. The attention to detail in every aspect of the series elevates it from enjoyable and entertaining to truly exceptional.The sets in the Game are mostly simple, with a childish surreality. Yet also artfully designed for the impact that they have, and exquisitely memorable.Usually when the acting is good, we don\\'t notice or think about it. But there were several times that actors displayed their emotions which such perfectly controlled subtlety that you have to stop to admire it: the uncontrollably trembling chin of an actor pushing himself to the edge of tears to do honor to the scene, or an actor\\'s blank face with the character\\'s emotions \"betrayed\" by only the twitching of one eye.Needless to say, the directing and production must have also been top-notch to create these scenes and put them together to tell such a simple but compelling story. The emotional impact is also carefully crafted: somehow, in the midst a huge number of violent deaths, the audience is left sobbing for half of an episode as both developed and undeveloped characters face impending death.And ultimately, there is a fairly clear moral to the story. But that will have more impact if it\\'s seen and felt, instead of described here.,One of the best shows I\\'ve watched! Everyone of the actors was so so good.,I have to hand it to the Koreans, the two things I\\'ve seen from there both had very similar dark themes - the other being \"I Saw the Devil\". Both of which are truly disturbing pieces of art, but you can\\'t help but keep watching to see what the conclusion may be.The show raises some interesting questions about human nature and what drives us to do the awful things we do to one another, and you can\\'t help but wonder if such a shadowy society producing a game like this for wealthy clients really does exist somewhere. Either way, it\\'s a very clever concept and masterfully done.I do hear that the subtitles to English are not always accurate but I don\\'t speak Korean so cannot comment on that. Even if they\\'re not, I was able to follow along and I\\'m hoping I didn\\'t miss too much of the plot.,Sangh wu offered and showed compassion when he didn\\'t had to(HELPING ALI) and He played him when he had to.SETU.,Squid is a great show I will not write a long review but you need to watch it.,Squid Game is a Death Game Series, It\\'s Looking Familiar be like Alice in Borderland, Actor & Atress is Very Good, Music is Amazing, My Favorite Round is Red Light, Green Light & The Man with the Umbrella, And The Series has Most Viral on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter & Youtube. The Series, I Giving 10 Star, I LOVE IT!Rating: 10/10.,Sure, it\\'s pretty predictable at times, but the execution (no pun intended) is excellent. What makes Squid Game so good is it\\'s characters and how they try to manage themselves. The subplot of the cop, I could\\'ve done without. It was just filler.,Squid Game is a thrilling, emotional and absorbing South Korean drama / thriller series. The series is filled with superb performances, fantastic production values and sets, riveting games and personal storylines. It gets a strong recommendation from me. If you can handle it.,Sorry folks, this is not good. I don\\'t know why there is so many great reviews. The main guy is an idiot and loser and not likable at all. But that is not the bad part. Why would you participate in something you have no idea what it is? They will offer you lots of money if you win? You don\\'t think it could be dangerous? No one asked this? All other game shows that you can win money and prizes, don\\'t drug you and have masked people. The first game was so stupid. Every single person moved at red light. Ever so slightly, but they still moved. And only some got shot? And all those people still ran after they saw guys get shot when they moved? Are they all idiots? And green light and red light switched on time, but when all those people got shot, it stayed red for awhile. Why? Really stupid. Also you know you can die so why continue playing. They never mentioned that you can\\'t quit in the first episode. I would say f this I\\'m out after the first game.,I did not expect it to be so good! This series shows the depths of human behavior, reminded me for a moment Black Mirror.Just watch and you won\\'t regret it. I\\'m becoming a fan of Korean movies and series. They know how to do the job.Wonderful script, Intriguing,funny, touching and frightening All at once.,If you can deal with the graphic violence you\\'ll enjoy a well acted, well directed mini masterpiece about the human psyche, desperation, relationships, greed, selfishness and sacrifice. Refreshing to watch after all the predictable dross out there. Just about long enough too. Recommended.,I tried to give it a watch I heard nothing but excitement over this show so I decided to see what the fuss is all about and I don\\'t understand. I couldn\\'t even make it 20 minutes into this mess. Robbing old ladies, gambling problems. And blood fetish from the mafia? Insanely boring I couldn\\'t even keep my attention up enough for them to get to playing the \"games\" I heard they do in this show. Disappointing.,...Korean, Chinese and Japanese.Dear Hollywood...R. I. P.,When I first started Squid Game I didn\\'t expect much. Just something to pass time at work. After the first two episodes I was hooked. The show is thrilling and makes your heart beat increase. I highly recommend watching if you are looking to have some entertainment for a couple hours.,Some of South Korea\\'s most popular and innocent children\\'s games from the 1970s and 1980s are reinvented as a mysterious survival game with a cash prize of 45.6 billion won for the winner. However, there is a catch: \"Losers must pay with their lives!\"My Thoughts:\\r\\nIt\\'s been about two days since I finished Squid Game, and it hasn\\'t left my mind. I still can\\'t believe I finished all nine episodes in one sitting.The acting is beyond phenomenal, and it elicited emotions in me that I had never felt before in any other show. EVERYTHING about the production value, the plot, the character development, the set designs, was simply amazing. I went into this show expecting to mostly enjoy it and then move on, but I had no idea it would have such an impact on me.Squid Game amazingly combines the carefree, idyllic days of childhood with the harsh realities of adulthood by forcing ordinary people to compete in life or deathmatches to potentially wipe out their debts. It\\'s a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer that\\'s equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing. In other words, there is something for everyone in this show. It\\'s emotional, dramatic, with enough blood scenes to satisfy suspense and thrill-seekers.In a nutshell, according to me, the current buzz surrounding Squid Game is well-deserved. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who hasn\\'t seen it. This is one of my favorites on Netflix right now.,This Korean drama shows up Hollywood in every way. By the third episode, the viewer is totally immersed in the characters\\' struggles, because this is just good writing. Each character is more and less than they appear to be. We have fascinating and necessary back stories, which make the action incredibly poignant. This is not, as many critics have claimed, a gory show. It\\'s no more violent than something like Game of Thrones. Less so, as the main violence is people being dispatched by gunfire. I do think the last few episodes weren\\'t as good as the first ones, but I suspect they\\'re planning a follow-up season, so much was left unexplained. Great show that really explores human nature, both the good and the bad.,The plot is exciting.. keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat.. but the ending is so rushed and not so great.. the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players .. then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene.. they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax..in the earlier part it\\'s kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to Gi Hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him.. I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo\\'s good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun\\'s money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending.,I was very surprised by the quality of the storytelling. This story is like a parable, like Greek mythology, a simple story with a message, to make a point that life is not fair. We are not all equal, luck plays a big part in our successes and failures, and ultimately we are in a state of stupor going about our daily rituals, seeking something we don\\'t have, driven by greed which in turn is driven by the desire to have fun and escape boredom, and some of us will do anything if we are given permission to do it and are rewarded for it. This story of humanity is universal, and can be told in a million different ways. The Squid game tells this story in its own way.I think people are horrified at what humans can do to another person, but history has shown us that time and time again, most people are capable of the most awful things if they are scared, alone, are at one point powerless, and then at another point, given power and rewards. It takes a very special person to rise above this. Very special indeed. And if you think you are that person, you are most likely mistaken. This is why the ending of this series is so unpredictable, because out of the ashes, from the depths of despair, can arise a person who is not compelled to be bound by the arbitrary rules set by the powerful, someone who makes all the difference to others, who can see the truth, at last. It is no accident therefore that the writers have juxtaposed religion here and there and \\'Jesus?\\' is asked at the right moment. Very clever in all respects. Thank you to all involved.,Not in the same league as a lot of korean stuff,its a steady series thats about it,most of the caracters in it are as dumb and thick as dogs💩,and it dose\\'nt take no working out whats going to happen at the end.,After money heist its next amazing bog thing on netflix ..from above it looks like only thriller but actually its a fulll package u need to must watch ...foled with emothoon and every thing that one wants in the show.,Rating: 8This show was identical to Money Heist in so many ways. The costumes, the plot, the way how people tackle situations and obviously Netflix. Squid Game seems like Money Heist of an alternate darker reality. But I enjoyed it. I hope the series does not get milked much. The acting performances were good, I liked how the games were simple yet ingenious.This series, I believe took heavy influence from old movies like Cube and Exam. Exam is a really underrated flick and I could sense the influence in the finale.I believe you can give it a watch and climb the hype train. It has comedy, gore, tragedy etc a complete package but it\\'s not a must watch. I think it will get renewed for a Season 2 but after the finale something felt amiss hence I am giving it an 8. Probably because I have seen Money Heist, Exam, Cube, Saw etc hence I didn\\'t find the plot as completely new and offbeat.,I recall a book from the very early 80\\'s, \\'The Ludi Victor\\' by James Leigh, which is pretty much the same idea repackaged here. Squid Game is quite well done. No real surprises, even the person behind it all wasn\\'t too difficult to guess once you connected some of the dots. In an endless sea of bland series though this does stand out so it\\'s worth the watch.,I remember watching Korean films back in the day and they had .. something. These days it seems they copy American style with a bit of a twist, but still disappointing.In episode 4, they make a huge plot mistake which makes no sense (food, without spoiling too much).This show is like news media... using something to shock you, to get you to watch, but no quality or depth to it.,So Initially I liked this.Than in the last couple of episodes everything was ruined.It sort of forgets what the main character wants to become.So the game has been running for decades. Yet it was sponsored by a man who died in the last episode???How does that work?I am sure some of the translations where not correct.The shaky English by the V. I. P. S sort of make that obvious. The V. I. P. S have to be the worst actors I have seen in a Korean show. I can\\'t believe those people even have resumes and all experience as writers.... Can\\'t they tell them to get other talent. Why did the majority of them have to be Westerners as well ???So after this was ruined. I looked back. And thought about what I liked.And I have to admit I was blinded by some of the decors and the art direction.There is too much that doesn\\'t make sense , like the side operation run by some of the employeesSo the minimum I can give is 1 star when I rate a title.I gave it two stars because I liked the acting of the character Sae Byeok by Hoyeon Jung. As well as the other girl she paired up with in episode 5 and 6.I decided not to give a star for the art direction as their were some obvious fails to that as well. But I don\\'t think the art department can be held responsible for that.They did have the best lines and writing as well.Really this is not worth your time as well.... just watch battle royale or tag.The shooting of this might have been a lot of fun. That is why it sort of is funny that the sick organisor says it is more fun if you participate instead of watching . Well I think this holds true for this show.,There\\'s nothing new here. And it\\'s not better than any of the many other films, programmes, or books out there on the very same topic. In fact, I completely fail to see the appeal as well as the point.It\\'s not a bad show, and if you haven\\'t seen any other films or programmes about people being pawns in (generally) wealthy people\\'s sick and murderous games, it might be enjoyable.,Very gorey, love that. The plot was predictable most of the time, and the ending was so unsatisfactory. They\\'ll prolly show what happens next in season 2, but honestly ever since number 067 died, it hasn\\'t been the same. I was rooting for her so hard, even tho I knew she wouldn\\'t win in the end.Also, I\\'ve a feeling the officer didn\\'t die, he was shot in the SHOULDER by his BROTHER. Lol that\\'s just my theory. I\\'ve a feeling the officer will come back in S2 and save the front man, cause the front man is prolly mixed up in this and can\\'t leave.,I thought I cried during the hunger games, yeah no. This was more than I could\\'ve ever imagined. Very eye opening to what our world can and could be like. Very happy they released this when they did, this show is phenomenal.,The thing is, for me at least, I had to \"forgive\" much of the script, there are big plot holes in the series that one has to just overlook to make it to the end and give it such high ratings.Don\\'t get me wrong, I get this is not supposed to be taken literally, and some suspension of disbelief is necessary for most syfy series, but you have to be consistent with your own premise.(Side note, sorry if there\\'re mistakes/misspellings, somethings up with my app it seems.),Spoiler !All deasthes can be predicted in orderSpoiler !One of the most predictable thing which can be named was the \"OLDMAN\" key role in the game, from the scene of \"Night Chaos\" that he shouted \"Stop\" and the \"Black Man\" obeyed his order.,This is a good show; the concept is good, the acting from the main cast is solid, it deserves to be watched by the masses.But; it\\'s not a great show... it has some plot holes, as well as some terrible acting by the American characters (I won\\'t include any spoilers, but I guarantee you\\'ll know what I mean)All I\\'ve seen these past few weeks is the serious hype surrounding the show, and as someone who is a bit of a film buff, it needed an honest review. Go watch it, you\\'ll enjoy it, but please don\\'t claim it as the best show ever.,This is a must watch. It speaks for itself. It\\'s violent yes, but the characters are alive with plenty of personality. Pure quality. Perfect storyboarding and addictive. Yes, the weakest part is the WIPs but the rest is perfect.,An excellent modern fable that strongly resonates with the debt crisis (specially in South Korea). It is more of a psychological commentary about human behavior in life/death situations.,#SquidGame, I believe each & every game, each & every episode was almost perfect! I believe I never felt any boring scene throughout the series despite 1 hour long 9 episodes. Every game is edge of the seat moment, the way director created emotions at the end of marbals game that was Outstanding. That old man & Ali was phenomenal. The lead 3 character were fantastic throughout the series! Only VIP\\'s acting wasn\\'t good as needed but it doesn\\'t create any effect on the series! A Definitely must watch series!,This series show us how can be tricky to be poor but paying with the life is not a good end to the problems.This kinda violates human rights in some ways that are impossible to describe but the end of the series make it worth watch.Carefull with the games you play , guns are not the end of all lives sentence.,From all the Netflix shows that theyre taking over the world by storm Squid game is my favourite. The story is very interesting, the actors are incredible and the drama is perfect. Episode 6 is the best emotional episode that i\\'ve seen this year but then is falls down with the cringe VIPs and the twist at the end kind\\'a takes the emotions that you felt at the end of ep 6. Althought a good series and looking foorward too season 2!!,I watched this because everyone else already had. And it was supposed to be ground breaking.It is far too long. I was just sitting there waiting for the next game to begin. Would have been better as a movie. The bad ending didn\\'t help.I had to resist the urge a couple of times to fast-forward to the last episode. How it became so popular I have no idea. But it was alright.,Thoroughly enjoyed this show, waaaay out there, but so out there it was truly captivating!,Overhyped nonsense with a typical K Drama thrown in for good measure.The story is a carbon copy of several other Netflix shows, including a Japanese tv show from a few years back\\r\\nThe acting is way overexaggerated and borderline cheesy\\r\\nThe setup is completely nonsensical and the atmosphere in the film, except for a few moments, is poorly done.The only reason this show got the exposure it got is because of the enormous amount of marketing it received from Korean conglomerates. This was advertised on every bus and taxi in Seoul for months.If you\\'re going to be copying a typical battle royale formula, at least make it original.,The shows interesting, it\\'s entertaining, but the main character is such an idiot I wish he would have died right away.,Simply Genius... A masterpiece... Its a must watch webseries.... Grt performance by each and every character...\\r\\nWaiting for season 02.. korean webseries are never disappoints..,If you are looking for a happy ending look elsewhere. The ending was meeeeeh but just give it a try. Great acting here.,I have to agree with others: I really didn\\'t like the last three episodes and the wrap-up was dissatisfying. \"Gganbu\" was one of the strongest episodes in an emotional perspective, yet the last episodes tracked back with the reveal of the \"one\" behind everything on one of the most interesting relationships they set up through the entirety of the show.They also left one of the most interesting characters who had so much potential completely behind, Sae-byeok, and completely invalidated the sacrifice of Ji-yeong and the impact of their scene - which was a shame.The VIP\\'s were stereotypes, horrible actors, and extremely unnecessary. I hated every second on screen they appeared and their absolutely dumb commentary.Up until Episode 7, I would have given it a 9 or 10. Episode 7 onwards was a 4 for me. 10+4 / 2 = 7 stars overall.,I particularly like the way the characters are built and their stories are shown to the viewer and how their life is desperate to the point they put it in risk to make it better.,Koreans now to the Emmy awards. Great, surprising.But ending is disappointing. Maybe It\\'s because of there\\'s another season ..,I agree with others about the VIPs acting and line being awful. I watched it dubbed in English, so it could be translation, or voice acting that went awry. Otherwise the dub was quite good(well for dub standards). I think I\\'ll be watching it a second time with just subtitles.South Korean cinema has become so popular in the West because it carries a certain gravitas and detail many western movies lack these days. I\\'m far from a film buff who looks forward to Tribeca or Sundance, but I can confidently say there is a distinct discipline displayed in South Korean films and shows. From the emotions on display by talented actors, to scripts that rely more on showing over telling, to the amazing seeds sown early that lead to payoffs later. And it\\'s all wrapped up in great cinematography.Squid Game is no different. It might not reach the heights of OldBoy or Parasite or even I saw the Devil, and is a little more predictable. But it is a must watch for fans of South Korean films.,This Korean series is a poor, lame adaptation and actualization into a bloody pop Korean culture context, of a short story (\"El premio\", The prize) by Julio Cortázar. Only in a iliterate culture such as actual you can explain why people became fans of such a lame tv series. If you hace read Cortázar\\'s shor5t story, you will know immediatlñy that that\\'s the major spoiler you can recieve from this schow.,It is disturbing in a way that why the hell is happening this ?But I have to say that the plot is unique ( Not in a good way or bad way but very dark grey i guess ).Okay, At last my opinion is one should watch this.,Terrible VIPs and second to last episode was trash, but in whole it\\'s great, recommend to watch.,I didn\\'t like the final episode that much. Way too much mellow drama for my personal taste. I would have preferred if more then one character survived, those characters being Seoul Gihun, Kang Sae, Sang Woo, and Jang. I really didn\\'t like how Jang went out.Overall a good intense show.,Everything is predictable and nothing surprising happened about who survived the game and what happened at the end...the games had nothing like intelligent mind game, they are just a bunch of gambles plus trial of muscle strength which is completely a disadvantage for women. The masterminds, the fellows, rich vips, people who showed up in business scene etc are all male, also there were full of misogyny and insulting lines to women which supposedly old stereo type stupid males came up with. As a person who lives in an asian country near korea, there\\'s no wonder. Those elements were just disgusting and there was nothing fun to watch this show. I just kept watching it expecting something mindblowing would happen at the end by high scored reviews but NO nothing at all. I just waisted my time.,It\\'s definitely not usual korean drama. It doesn\\'t have any romance or any thing. So any one even who don\\'t like korean drama can enjoy it.If you like escape room or Alice in boarderland it is definitely your kind of series. Story is simple a group of people play children\\'s games and who loses will die. Even it is children\\'s games it will keep you at the edge. That\\'s also the speciality of the series.This series will never going to disappoint you It\\'s worth every bit of your time.,I love squid game. I watched all 9 episodes in 2 days as it was so intriguing. Episode 6,9 and 1 were so good and the games were so tense and creative such as the first one and the tug of war won. Episode 6 was really sad with many of my favourites dying like Ali and il nam. The twist at the end of ep 9 was good with IL name creating the games but I didn\\'t like it that much. There are some unnecessary rude scenes in ep 4 and 7 but I just forwarded them.Overall,I rate the show 8.5.It was definitely Netflix\\'s best show but it was not the greatest show of all time.,Being a fan of Korean cinema I was intrigued by this series and over the weekend became addicted to each episode. I was especially intrigued as I know Jung Ho-Yeon from the fashion industry and worked with her on many fashion shows. Didn\\'t know she could act as well as she did and look as unattractive that her role called for. The only but for me was the VIPS and the manner in which they were portrayed. It was vulgar, crude and racist and a total turn off for me.,Didn\\'t like the Korean overacting or the premise or the pacing. Got 2/3rds of the way through Ep1 and gave up. Can\\'t see what all the fuss is about and I normally give stuff like this a chance.,It started off slow but picked up and starts to catch your attention Quick after the plot is revealed...the Characters are interesting and by the middle of the show your already explained of most of their roles. Definitely something different from most recent series.,First few episodes were good.but than those vips kind of ruined it......hate to break it. .but how somebody can enjoy it when you are killing people like some tomato bags.,Omg it was amazing! Attractive, interesting and exciting from the first episode! I LOVE IT! I love the whole characters and how they played their roles, it was damn sad when the grandpa have died and Sae-Byeok at the end.,The Old Man being the main guy - hmm...\\r\\nThere are hints throughout the show btw. In the Green Light, Red Light he was the one who just triumphantly walked among the people trembling with fear after the \"K-Anabelle(lol)\" doll starts shooting.He smiles as he is enjoying the moment. But they wouldn\\'t kill him because as we saw he wouldn\\'t be killed after the Marbles Game, he still lives.So, maybe there was no stake for him, I guess or maybe there was... that\\'s why he volunteered to play. Or maybe just for fun of it, you know - as he says.Even in marbles episode, he is shown as a planner to trick 456 just to see if he tries to use the \\'dementia\\' of an \\'helpless\\' old man, even if he is considered a good friend. But he went out as a kind, loving grandpa kind of way. That\\'s why the twist - that he was the Mastermind bums most people. But he is a planner, a great one. I am not judging if he is a smart guy, should be an evil one. Just saying after the series shows he was.Just take this as a fun read, I guess. Umm, bye.,Last century misogyny, foul language, ageism, casual racism, greed and despair - basically everything that\\'s wrong with South Korea today, and which would be outright rejected if this was a Hollywood/Western production. It\\'s amazing how a few bits of cheap brightly coloured scenery and silly costumes can get people excited about what is a very old and trite concept. Yawn.,Other says Alice in Borderland has much intensity especially in episode 3 . But squidgame, it has a heart, loyalty . It\\'s a mix of As God\\'s Will, Triangle (2011) that ship scene.,What a unique, entertainingly disturbing concept. The writing was well done and kept the watchers guessing with lots of twist and turns. You feel for individual characters struggling to survive that many people can relent too. The games are simple yet disturbingly twisted which keeps\\r\\nYou wanting to see what comes next. Two thumbs up!!,A series high on adrenalin and suspence. With a very relatable lead. I loved the scenes. The lead does not feel untouchable, rather, you get the sence that he two may fall at any time. The plot is simple yet loveable.You actually understand why the characters are willing to go through what they endured based on their own personal struggles. It is a sad and emotional flick.Pay attention to the Subtitled even when watching the Dubbed version. It is full of nuggets ands gems.A masterclass that may have initiated me into a new genre.,Very very minor spoiler. The show as a whole was phenomenal, and I\\'d recommend it to almost anyone, but the ending was weak. The second half of the last episode honestly weakened my rating by two full stars. Still worth it though.,I really don\\'t get the hype. Done 5 episodes now and find it all rather boring.Maybe I was expecting too much when someone told me it similar to Battle Royale....?,This is a very strange series. It\\'s like a cross between Logan\\'s Run, The Hunger Games, Lost, Lord of the Flies (not to mention M. C. Escher) and a number of other dystopian books/movies that have come out over time. I grant that the way the story is told is somewhat original, and as an example of Korean drama, I suppose it gets a few points for raising that profile....But seriously...WTF!!!!!The dialogue, is addition to being almost juvenile at times, is made even more excruciating by the absolutely horrible, over the top, beyond melodramatic delivery by both the original Korean actors and the those doing the English dub. But even the scenes in English (the VIPS) was ridiculous, so while this may be intended and a normal quality of Korean cinema, it doesn\\'t automatically make it good or even ok. My score of 3 is almost exclusively due to this. It made the show nearly unwatchable. Maybe this makes more sense in the original Korean and would have been better served by English subtitles. I don\\'t know.I also question the premise for the show in the first place. Yeah, times are tough, but would people really be that morally depraved? After the first round when they were allowed to leave, I find it difficult to believe that anyone would come back no matter how difficult their situation was on the outside. And how could anyone ever possibly emotionally separate their \"winnings\" from how they were acquired? And while the \"1 year later\" epilogue does cover this to some extent, I mean really, what kind of horrible, sad, miserable life is Gi-hun going to have? Obviously they\\'re planning a second season, so maybe we\\'ll find out more, but I don\\'t think I really care .Also, as we learn more about the operation of the contest itself, more questions arise. First you wonder how they explain all the deaths. Then when you realize they are harvesting organs, you have to ask why a sudden influx of supposedly anonymous organ donations wouldn\\'t be questioned by someone. And wouldn\\'t there be a sudden flurry of missing persons reported that the authorities would be looking into? I get it. It\\'s a fantasy dystopian thing, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief on this point.However, I liked the creepy use of Tchaikowsky\\'s waltz from \"Serenade for Strings\", Strauss\\'s \"Blue Danube\" and \"Fly Me to the Moon\" and found it to be one of the more interesting aspects.But again, seriously......WTF!!!P. S. How again is the game court supposed to look like a squid?,Annoying characters, illogical events, boring dialogues, very precictable. What was this all about? That Koreans like violence and satanic killing? The idea is the series is quite good but the script is eventually pretty weak.,Make sure watch it\\r\\nits amazingif u wana more excellent korean series?I offer u thisflower of evil\\r\\nmy dangrus wife\\r\\ngoblin\\r\\n& hotel deluna.,This TV show was very sad in the beginning but as it goes on it get good the story is very well written and I got to warn you its very graphic I give this show a thumbs up make that 4.,OK: I\\'ve only seen the first episode, but what a drivel it is! As if this would ever happen in real life. It also - forever - lowers my faith in both Japan as a refined culture and people in general who praise this a-b-s-o-l-u-t-e tripe.Why even make this kind of TV-series when it only focuses on how much blood people can bleed? Please avoid at all costs.,What is wrong with the world? Lol this show is horrible and predictable but mostly stupid.Episode 2, they all go home... those that survived. Then they go back, willingly and I\\'m supposed to feel sorry for them? Oh, my they are so broke that they\\'ll go enter games to kill themselves for money that if they die they don\\'t get so they leave their family without answers to even where they\\'ve gone. Now their family will spend a lifetime looking for them.That\\'s selfish.I think people today are easily entertained. The thought of being so stupid so play chilhood games in a deadly way for money is insane. Oh and it was obvious #1 was in on it... he was far too happy playing a Red Light and definitely moved lol.I\\'m in awe, seriously.,Despite the moody grim nature of the show it manages to pull off great thrills, human drama and most importantly hope and an ending that satisfies giving hope to its viewers. It doesn\\'t try to be ultra realistic or end on a depressing grim note which is why I loved this show!!!,Its no doubt this series is great.. But is it worth all the hype it\\'s getting across the world?! No...The concept looks similar to modified concepts from several movies that we might have seem before.. like hunger games, battle royal, the condemned, the running man and many more..While the games itself were okayish to watch, the show is not about the games.. Its more about the relationship between players.. Ots all about the emotional connect.. Overall, its a good unreasonably overhyped series..,Standard down on their luck beginning of characters, then the storyline quickly goes into overdrive with many social mores broken.I guessed the ending but the reason I don\\'t give this 10/10 is the last episode is somewhat muddled. The angst and actions of the main character is weakly explained.,So misanthropic, violent, gory, pessimistic, vague, misleading and superficial... but its production was very good and in good taste.Maybe that\\'s just what most people care about and this is the reason that it has an 8 rating on IMDb!Don\\'t let your children watch this also!Politically it was so vague and maybe it can give some people very wrong ideas about authoritarian systems and regimes.Don\\'t forget about the whole series just because it has a decent humanistic ending!On most occasions, there wasn\\'t any humanistic approach at all.There was something more like amnesia, players keep forgot that they have to kill everyone to be able to go out, just unbelievable.Casting of all non-Korean actors for VIPs were completely scornful and wrong and the actors who played the VIPs were sounding so amateur and unnatural.There was some good stuff and some good intentions in this TV mini-series but it was buried under these negative aspects of it.6.3/10.,First six episodes are great - excellent introduction of characters and how they got here, careful world-building, clever and shocking games with increasing suspense up to episode 6 which is the peak of the showBy episode 7 there are about 20 players left, with a couple of \"important\" characters. That\\'s where the show goes downhill:the fifth game is almost entirely luck based and running order practically determines who will pass. It also weeds out a lot of players giving us finalists out of nowhere-the winner is predictable and almost all uncertainties are removed prior to the final game, that confrontation felt empty\\r\\nVIPS are abomination and ruin these last 3 episodes by a lotThe cop - lost brother plot resolved in a very underwhelming wayFront man is still a mystery - how he got to that position and why, his only redeeming quality is cool maskThe host and the grand scheme are also very underwhelming and predictablethe 1 year later epilogue is just depressing, maybe that was the intentionAll in all, I feel it could\\'ve been better. It\\'s like they\\'ve run out of ideas towards the end.,The series uses recurring theme of anime like jujutsu kaisen, btooom and movie like Tournament, Gun Akimbo; tries to put together set of events which are predictable and characters which you cannot relate to. And to make that happen there is very stupid premise of VIPs and debt for which people are ready to kill and die for.,I wasn\\'t hoping it to be this good but it has a good story, good graphics and well acted. Teaches a few life lessons. Sometimes the story gets slow but picks up later on. A great watch indeed.,The premise and aesthetic of the show had me hooked already. Lots of mystery. Love-able and hate-able characters. The \"games\" they play are always intense and you hope your favourites survive.It was quite emotional too, there\\'s times where you have to be deceitful to your allies.Really great show all round. Although the VIP\\'s had atrocious acting when they were introduced around EP 7. Really took me out the immersion for an episode.Other than that it was amazing, I love Korean shows and you don\\'t get many on Netflix, so I hope the show does well so we see more.TL;DRIt\\'s great, watch it.,Sorry. That\\'s a crude summation of this brilliant series. It\\'s a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in. Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game.Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out. The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed. It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror. If you\\'re ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game.,I am seldom one to follow the masses and I am not probe to popular opinion. At first I was of two minds, but as the story develops it becomes more complex. The characters who seem likable and reasonable becomes more questionable. You become torn between their motivation and which is the real driver - survival or greed. Or are they possibly the same? In a world where ownership is survival what defines a fair game? If there is such a thing anymore... This is very good storytelling even if a bit extreme. The lines between good and bad gets blurred. The walls between ethical and immoral is broken down. The subtext is phenomenal and though the violence feels somewhat unnecessary (it could have been done less graphical), it is driven by very strong narrative threads. Highly recommended! This is Money Heist, but with an actual story.,Life is boring when you are a billionaire. Gripping with anxiety but futile and aimless if you poor. One gets excitement the other gets money and aim. Where is all to lead? Have a look.,A series or movie that makes time pass quickly because you\\'re so into it is greatly appreciated by me. So many titles to choose from but only a few leave you with a feeling of satisfaction after viewing. Several Korean series hit that mark, Vagabond, Kingdom, Tunnel, to name a few. The only problem I have is with scenes that go on way to long, Nine episodes could\\'ve been cut to six with some efficient editing but other than that I loved it.,Every episode they took morea than anything efforts to make such a great show. I love this show and all the characters made this show a very well. Congratulations to all the cast and crew for working for this series. Loved it and i can watch it again and again.,I don\\'t know how to feel about this series, it left me with so many feelings. I have to say that I liked it for that reason. I was very uncomfortable watching the show, but something kept me watching. There were some plot holes that other people have mentioned already. I also think that some of the gruesomeness was a bit unnecessary. I understand that the gore was a big part in the whole show, but some of the scenes were a little too much. Otherwise, definitely worth a watch.,Very good tv show as i expected from the Korean shows but i think the storytelling is not very well although the characters are well written\\r\\nAnd i liked the Design and Music also some twist events.,What i really liked about this is its completely different to all the other formulaic shows, i watch a lot of tv and even if i am watching something i am really enjoying i often feel i have seen it before. This is completely unique. Totally absorbing on the edge of your seat television.,An absolute masterpiece of tv show\\r\\nThe actors the story the cast, music, just all is prefect, enjoyed every minute of it.,The survival story is actually pretty good, but it doesn\\'t really surprise me in a way like how a thriller should be able to suprise you. Honestly, I must admit that is too overrated since there are still tons of movies/series with better quality. To me, the story is not that tense and plot twist is also very average for a survival story.However, what I like the most is the emotional effects that you usually find from a K-drama. As a viewer, I am able to understand the characters\\' backgrounds till they want to sacrifice their life for money. I mean it is very sensible since you can find it in our everydays\\' life. Obviously, this is a very good point since most survival stories are not that logical and sensible. Well, we can find a lot of life lessons from Squid Game. I think this is one the reasons why it is too overrated despite the average plot twists.On top of that, I really love the \\'A Class\\' actors as the cameos, it\\'s quite surprising though I wish they could involve more. I think instead of the main casts, Gong Yoo is the main trigger why people are so curious to watch it. In other words, A Class cameos are the stars there. Well, I really hope they will bring back Gong Yoo and Lee Byun Hun later on!,The messages of this series were too negative. The topics have been done before, but this series shows worse versions of the topics.Nearly everything was predictable. Stupid decisions are made. Don\\'t understand what all the hype was about. Won\\'t be watching the second season. If any.,In my opinion, \"Squid Game\" is overhyped, and I don\\'t see any other reason than good marketing and viral advertisement.The story is nothing new: game, where the last survivor(s) get(s) the prize. We had seen it in anime, tv-shows, and movies like \"Cube\". Nothing special. What Squid Game does different? Actually, not much. It discloses the motivation of the characters, which is, eventually, irrelevant. It allows to fill half of a season instead of filming 1.5 hour movies.Do I think it\\'s a bad show? No, it\\'s decent and I don\\'t regret watching it. Yet it\\'s quite basic in every possible respect, distinguished by quality of the scenes, but not content..,Ok first and foremost hear me out, it\\'s Jigsaw but made in a larger environment, with bigger budget and more techy stuff, with same poorly executed and barely noticeable subtle society criticism. Is it watchable? Yes it is. Is it ground breaking, revolutionary, never seen before kind of story that people will remember and passionately talk about even 10 years from now; like the overhype wants you to believe? Absolutely not. Acting is probably the worst part of this show, characters are hard to believe and sympathize with with almost no character development, the way you see them in the first episode is the way they stay for the rest of it... All in all, for people who for some reason tend to fetishize Korean production and for people who want to be up to date with what TikTok is talking about this is a must watch, for everyone else watch if you want but even if you skip it you\\'re not missing anything.,..... ruined by some extremely unlikeable characters, and some really terrible voice acting. It\\'s visually stunning, though, with several impressive sets.,Firsts things first, the series is really well made and has a very well thought and written story.Speaking of story, this one was super realistic in regards to what would happen if such a situation were to happen, the only 2 problems I had were thinking of a way someone could be that rich to afford such facilities and to buy a island for themselves while keeping everything unsuspicious. Talking about unsuspicious, problem number 2 is how would 456 be kidnapped and no one would notice? Other than that I have no other critic to the story, well done, realistic and interesting.Image wise it is as impressive as a series gets. The sceneries are beautifully well made. Interesting camera angles for a series as well.Lastly I want to point something out, a technicality that I noticed (and like I noticed this one I might have missed many others or there might not even exist any other, I don\\'t know). When they are at the Tug of War, when a team loses they all fall down the bridge. I also noticed that it takes a few seconds for the blade to cut the rope. If putted the pieces together then shouldn\\'t the winning team fall down the bridge as well duo to the massive weight difference, especially when it\\'s a team with 3 women vs one full of men and the team with the women wins (meaning the team with only men is heavier)?To finish, the series is not perfect but it is pretty damn high up there.,It could have been great - human selfishness exposed through worst excesses of capitalism, emotional struggles and ridiculously tough life and death choices, great sets, plenty of villains and drama.Instead, it is so unbelievably full of plot holes that it could only work as a parody, perhaps even really well. Unfortunately, Squid Game takes itself more seriously than a 19th century psychiatrist. It oozes heaviness and deep philosophy that its clownishly overacting cast (VIPs are the least of the show\\'s problems) just cannot bear out.,My ears rang, the never-ending drone of people clamoring on about a new television show, one that raised their expectations of Korean cinema and the content Netflix sponsors. I ignored it for a while, but the incessant noise could only be filtered out for so long - eventually I gave in. The faint tap of the buttons on my Google TV remote echoed through my living room, the silence almost deafening. I sat there for a while, looking at the cover - what did it all mean? I knew, of course, there was only one way to find out - I had to watch it. I had to steel myself; bend my legs, jump on the bandwagon. For a few moments I sat puzzled, wondering why I couldn\\'t grasp the context; my brain was moving at a million miles per hour and skipped over something integral to my understanding of the media - subtitles. The echoes of the remote could be heard again as I navigated the maze of menus to provide me with context to this global phenomenon, something I had managed to avoid for as long as I could.As I sit there, the darkness almost entirely enveloping me (save for the incredible illumination of the 55\" screen on the wall), I began to sink. I sank further and further, my sense of awareness gently escaping my grasp. 001. 199. 218. 456. The numbers revolved around me, my attention skittering between them. Who do I pine for? Who do I despise? Who do I pity? Who do I envy? Even though my mind raced through these questions, it could never find an answer. No, it could never perform any task in its entirety as it was completely and utterly hypnotized by the reel of cinema rolling before my eyes.Eventually, I came to. I looked at my clock: 3:53 AM. How much time had passed since I sat down? I couldn\\'t remember. I picked up my phone and a steady stream of notifications littered my lock screen. I asked myself a different question - how many DAYS had passed? I had been so engrossed in this work of art I lost all sense of being, all sense of time, all sense of life. And yet, I never felt like I missed something, like I had passed on experiences that would have made me feel some semblance of happiness and joy. My life had skipped two days in the blink of an eye and I didn\\'t feel anything. And despite watching the illegible names of several people I knew nothing about in Hangul gently scroll up, I still continued to think about the event I had just witnessed. What happens next? At the moment, I don\\'t know (though, my mind certainly has ideas). But I can only hope that this phenomenon continues, as my mind couldn\\'t take the hit of knowing this would be the only exposure to something so interesting, something so vile yet gripping.So I say to you - stop reading this convoluted memoir and watch it. You eyes may bleed; your mind may shatter - but you will never feel something as incredible as this piece of television.,Intense. Massively intense!!!Games. Choices. Money. Decision.Oh what a twist! Salute to the Scriptwriter and Director, Hwang Dong-hyuk!Cheers to all the actors! It made me scream and cry!9.5/10#SquidGame.,Squid Game is a solid show but that\\'s it. I don\\'t know why there is such a hype about it. This show is just a few weeks old but already overrated...,With a premise similar to the likes of Cube and Circle, the odd titled Squid Game helps us question humanity all over again as well as the importance society places on money.As dark and violent as Battle Royal and intriguing as 3% it grabs your attention early on and keeps you guessing to the end.Great binge worthy series with a likeable cast and main protagonist.Knocked off one point as I didn\\'t love the ending but otherwise a really great TV series with some great ideas and worthy of top marks.Season 2? Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again...,This has budget, making for some entertaining scenes, but the plot is quite poor, many parts didn\\'t make sense, too much of it down to luck and it\\'s very predictable. The characters\\' back stories are uninteresting, there\\'s not much character development. It\\'s average at best for the genre.,Interesting Korean take on Hunger Games and Battle Royale. Good start with intrigue and character building until it became boring, pretentious and predictable cliché.,Take Battle Royale, Alice in Borderland, and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji - put them in a blender with all the best parts of each - BOOM you get Squid Game. Incredible plot, great acting (yea the English VIPs were awful, but not enough to the people who are complaining about them in reviews), and the intensity...wonderful series.,It started good but end up pretentious.There were many things left unexplained like\\r\\n1- the videos were already sent to police .2- how did the cop\\'s brother become a master and for what .3- there were people who\\'s supposed to take the MC kidney, but somehow and even though he never paid them back ( since he never used the money ) after a year , he still had his kidneys .4- I don\\'t remember how many players were there but how did they manage to split into groups of tens. It doesn\\'t make any sense .5- the cop that was shot, the body will be found and even if it didn\\'t , he would still be remain missing, which is a huge problem since he\\'s a cop not just a citizen.6- when the old man told his assistant to excuse him from watching the game with the vips and wanted to play with the players, the vips only watched the glass game and the old man was expelled earlier so this doesn\\'t make sense eitherI don\\'t know what is it with Korean drama but they always mess it up , they start good but finish badly , the acting the story line , the plot holes .My god every time they show us the English speakers characters , I just want to throw up . The whole scene , the decorations , who the heck thought of that , why ruin it .And I must finish with , if you\\'re gonna watch this , you should watch the movie serie saw instead , it\\'s better anyway , since this was a huge rip off.I wished that the girl would have won .. and that the MC would have ended just as greedy and betrayer as others , it would be a better story line and very unexpected since she was only a side character .,Deadbeats and losers being used in games that result in death for the entertainment of elite. Brutal, disturbing, and depressing look into human psyche. But good.Also, if you want something along the same lines, check out the anime \"Kaiji\". I believe there is some inspiration from Kaiji although Kaiji is more about gambling games (and is even more entertaining I\\'d say).,It would be completely unfair to rate the actors if you watch English dub, because a lot is lost in translation. This is the best drama series available. I.,This serie could be on the top so many years.Variety of games, colors, act, scenes, suspense and even reality, who knows? Jaja.Great 1st episope at the half of it starts the action\\r\\n2nd one was like... oh no are they gonna leave the games??Later on the games are spot on and the only downside is the end. Although we know for sure it will be 2nd season.Just waiting for that.,I was hooked into the series right from the start. It has a good plot and getting to know the main character. From there it is a blast. Some people may find it disturbing, but it is a part if the show. You will have to watch it. Only down side is the last episode.,5 episodes in. Can\\'t stand player 070, but boy is this dark. Sick and scary. I can believe this stuff really happens, for sick people\\'s pleasure. A bit like Hostel, Saw and other scary stuff. Eye covering watching.,...Which is saying something for TV today. A lot of reviewers here seem to be getting caught up technical or other sidebar issues w/ the series, all forgetting the simple fact it\\'s a show, complete w/ weak, strong, good and bad moments. But it is most assuredly compelling TV without a doubt and hence my 8 rating. One episode had me in tears, while the 1st episode left a lot to be desired, some were extremely gripping, and certain aspects I could definitely quibble with. But overall, I hung in there throughout and would definitely recommend watching it, as it is compelling TV, and anything but boring! So go for it.,Not only did this hit show break international records like the most watched show of all time, it\\'s actually very entertaining and smart! It is very violent, let\\'s get that right, it\\'s not really made for everyone. But the story is really good and there\\'s a surprisingly good amount of philosophy in this show! How important is money? How important are friends? This show seriously makes you think! Truly amazing! The ending was weak but it doesn\\'t matter. The first 6 episodes are mind-blowing!! 🌟🌟🌟,I wanted to give this 9/10, as I enjoyed the first 6 episodes immensely. Ok, it\\'s not massively original in its premise, but the South Korean slant and the focus on individual debt made this more than interestingHowever, once the VIP\\'s arrived I felt it lost its way a little and the switch to English was quite jarring (I watched it in subtitles). Whether it was deliberate or not, the \"acting\" and dialogue of the VIP\\'s was pretty poor and riddled with unnecessary exposition and cliche. In addition, I felt the subplot regarding the stowaway policeman wasn\\'t properly resolvedWhilst the finale wasn\\'t terrible - it felt a little disjointed with some characters making decisions that seemed odd based on what they\\'d done before (Cho Sang-Woo for example in the Squid game). Also, the \"reveal\" in the skyscraper kind of ruined a few of the previous episodes.It\\'s a shame, as this could have been an even better series than it actually was - but it is still definitely worth a watch.,Some of it was good, some of it very good, some of it not so good.My frowning moments were:*** spoiler alert **** When they started killing each other, 27 people in total: too soon and over the top. Here I considered giving it 5 stars at most.* The ending during which the bad guy has a sudden change of heart, with no convincing explanation.* The English speaking people were over the top and somehow not very convincing. All except the sexual predator, which did add to the creepiness.* The importance of money made no sense to me; yes, poverty is a nuisance, but to have it turn you into a killing machine? Nor did I understand the 1 winner only system. I don\\'t recall it being specified that only 1 person could leave with the money (could\\'ve been made more clear in fact as the main character hopes to leave together with a girl). I personally think it would\\'ve been better and not damaging to the storyline if more people could\\'ve shared the prize merely by making it through all games alive. First of all there was enough money to go around for quite some people. But foremostly because I just don\\'t believe ANYONE except a crazed psychopath would agree to being the single winner, meaning you have to watch everyone (everyone - 500 people!) die. And they chose this voluntarily too, when they came back for that second round. Really, if I handed you a lottery ticket with a 1 in 500 chance of winning but a 500 to 1 chance of killing you, would you take it?* Melodrama on various occasions where less would\\'ve been more.* Like others have said that one screaming, scheming female should\\'ve been toned down (or replaced by a less annoying actress).* I thought the twist at ending okay but the ending after that somewhat daft. He should have just done what he should\\'ve done at the get-go: give a darn about his daughter.* The character developement of the main character was poor. He\\'s a selfish loser in the beginning and just the same in the end. Doesn\\'t go see his daughter, doesn\\'t share some of the money he won with the really poor. And his sudden change of morality just didn\\'t ring true with me.BUT, having said all this, after seeing the similar series \"Alice in Borderland\", I have to say I thought this way better. It certainly had me hooked all the way through. So I\\'d still recommend it if this type of story is your thing. The cinematography was great. And - I came back to add this - it really WAS very colourful and creepy (those masks, with different ranks according to symbol, and the private island), and not mainstream, and very entertaining.,I wanted to like this. I love Asian film and TV from most of their countries, and this entry started interesting enough but even some of the initial elements forbode what my instincts told me would be a lame ending, thus maintaining the \"we don\\'t care what we put out\" tradition of crappy Netflix fare. 9 hours to a horrible disappointing payoff. It started to go off the rails and become a self righteous preachy mess around episode 4. I won\\'t give away the ending but I warned you, though I\\'m sure the lemmings who follow anything will applaud it.,...But then I saw the American actors that play a role and I knew that all the acting was really bad.Starts off shocking and kinda intriguing and fades into being dumb and boring. Had a hard time paying attention by the end.,The main character is a foolish, clueless, impulsive, emotionally self-indulgent jerk.Other characters, flawed but fundamentally good people, die getting him back to the real world with that 45.6B won (~40M USD), but what does he do for the first year of having all that money? Does he help any of the loved ones left behind by those people who died getting him there with all that money?No, he leaves them all hanging, suffering for another year in the circumstances that were so bad it caused those good people who died saving him to go into and then back into that bloody Hell to try to save them.And then what does he do when he decides to go after the people behind the game? He calls them up and threatens them, making sure they know he\\'s an enemy to be removed.He\\'s a very unpleasant, impulsive and judgmental fool. Fortunately, although he\\'s clearly the main character from start to finish, he doesn\\'t dominate too much screen time, and there are plenty of other characters to enjoy watching .... although they pretty much all die.,Boring and uninspired, backed up by great marketing. After two episodes i was done, soo boring and simple story.The best thing about it must be the costumes, good design.,A movie would have been way too short and required some serious character cuts, however 9 episodes was also too long. There were a lot of lull moments that either dragged or unnecessary side stories that contributed very little to the overall story and arc of the protagonists. Had this been sliced down into 4 or 5 episodes, the overall pacing would have been much better and created an overall more intense viewing experience to constantly kept viewers on edge. A little trimming and this would handily have been a solid 10/10 experience at how fervent and enrapturing the story moves.One thing also worth commenting is that Netflix indirectly spoils the final episode. On the parental guidance at the top of the screen, the \\'suicide\\' word appears, ultimately revealing the outcome of the final game (even though it was rather predictable, it does confirm it).Not a bad series and worth watching, just do not watch all 9 episodes in a row or the story may move too slowly. It would be better with some time between episodes so you can build anticipation.,Those of you complaining about the VIPs are completely missing the point. This show is so damn clever. The VIPs are meant to be over the top, gaudy, and obnoxious. They\\'re representing the type of rich, entitled aholes that enjoy this kind of entertainment. These are the same guys that would set up a game of hunting for humans. Fantastic show.,Highly disappointed. The show started great but the ending is stupid as hell. I feels like I wasted my time watching this because so many things were left out. I am assuming there is another season into play but so far, I am giving it a solid three. I\\'ll come back and change my review once they fix this crap.,Kim joo & doek su are the ugliest people in this movie!!! The sex scene between the two made me vomit to the point where I had to stop watching the show.,I\\'ve watched too many power house Korean movies for this to have much of an impact on me. Sounds very pretentious me saying this but if you\\'ve watched movies like Oldboy, memories of murder, chaser, I saw the devil, (these are just scratching the surface) then you\\'ll know exactly what I mean. This just doesn\\'t hit the same way they do, I feel like this could possible be because it is being released on Netflix but whatevs - I wasn\\'t left gripping my seat the same way they do.Might not be a good thing honestly comparing this series to them with being completely different premises, but honestly this doesn\\'t come close. What I love about this show is that it will open up a lot of people who aren\\'t particularly regulars with watching something foreign, and show them what is out there to dive into and will break that barrier of entry down to make them go discover more film from this absolute master race of film makers, actors and story tellers. Mark my words NO ONE DOES IT BETTER THAN THE KOREANS. It\\'s just a shame that because the popularity this has seen so far will start to cloud over the absolute master pieces these people are capable of and have produced.,It\\'s an okay series, but I really don\\'t think it\\'s hypeworthy. Most, if not all, elements of the series have been there before, but better. Only distinguishing feature is that it\\'s korean.What really bothered me was: Overacting a lot of times. Or is that just a cultural thing?Cringeworthy dialogues from all people involved (especially the bad guys).Certain storylines just fizzle out into nothingness. What\\'s the purpose of having them then?,Thriller and entertaining series..hope we will get a season 2..really excited. The casting and acting are awesome. The directing is good and also the secenerios are pleassant to watch. Its really full of viloence so love who dont like action or like that shouldn\\'t watch.,My ratings are always either 1,5 or 10. I gave this 5 because it\\'s not a 10. It would have to be exceptional to get a 10 on my scale.People that are reviewing this as a game are completely missing the point. The show is meant to be a commentary on the current world we live in and how broken the system is. It is also meant to show people the mirror so they can look at their behaviour in society and realize how they currently live their lives. It shows the dark nature of human behaviour and how easily we are manipulated by the system.,Since watching the series \"Squid Game\" I have come across some criticism from viewers claiming that the show is being given too much credit and that it\\'s somewhat overrated. For me, it\\'s hard to deny how great the series is - it\\'s filled with compelling visuals and plenty of powerful characters. The pink-suit guards in black masks really draws the viewer in, the look is intimidating yet oddly fascinating and almost mesmerizing, and I believe the most iconic thing about the show (at least visually). As for the acting, Park Hae-soo is incredible as the dubious yet likeable Cho Sang-woo, while Lee Jung-jae perfectly captures the desperation and sadness of the show\\'s main protagonist Seong Gi-hun. With plenty of gut-wrenching action and gory violence, Squid Game will keep you guessing right to the last episode. So curl up on the couch, grab some Dalgona cookies and enjoy binging on Squid Game...just don\\'t pick the damn umbrella...,I gave it 4 episodes in the hope it would be something different from what I have seen before.,Most of Hollywood and almost every single(once beloved franchise) turned their backs on the customers. Too busy to lecture us and shove their woke religion down our throats but many other countries still make movies and series to entertain. To give us escapism, good story lines, thrills, believable characters with backgrounds and struggles, some who you despise, some who you care for, many of them grey and no political propaganda.No obvious message from the rich elite in Hollywood. No forced identity (with the exception of the elite watching the fights (poor acting, the sole downside of the movie) but real identities (e.g. Different characters).No all-powerful protagonists. Not total conformism. When a girl or woman fights a man it\\'s believable and no preaching. I love it. No endless preaching from the hypocrites (which constantly pulls you out of the movie experience) but good \\'le inventive and exciting entertainment.This is a high quality dystopian series from our Korean friends.If you are sick to the back teeth of modern day Hollywood sensibilities and microagressions like 95% of mankind then watch this macro aggression series. Highly recommended.,This series gets a 6 overall...For the concept and cinematography, this deserves a 7... Well filmed and good use of lighting and colours... The costume was vibrant and eye catching but rather bland after a couple of episodes... Some parts felt disjointed and out of place...The script in terms of story and logic gets a 6... Some illogical occurrences and lapses in a supposedly tightly controlled environment... Some characters seem to overreact all the time while some felt detached and unaffected...\"normal\" people seldom react similarly under duress but a few characters do not seem involved...a few act overly cool towards \"friends\" and a few overly warm towards \"adversaries\"...\\r\\nPerhaps there were too many characters to properly develop but even the main ones aren\\'t \\'likeable\\' enough to root for... And most of the plot became predictable before the half way mark..The acting was the major let down for me and scored between a 4 and a 5.... While there were some great moments yet generally throughout, acting weren\\'t believable... Fear and anger felt under whelming, aggression and obnoxious behaviours seemed overplayed... And some characters over act to clownish proportions...a few of the characters also don\\'t feel consistent, suddenly brave then turn cowardly or vice versa...I found most of the characters unrelatable at many points of the story development... This is partly the fault of the script but the acting or over-acting didn\\'t help...Can\\'t say much more without giving spoilers away... Overall, quite enjoyable but not one where I felt the need to keep chasing the next installment... Continue watching was to just check if my prediction is somewhat accurate instead of a need to find out what happens next... This point is where I feel the series is a let down...Combining the above assessment, an average score of 5.5 to 6 seems fair... Wish they paid more attention to the details... Game of thrones this isn\\'t, well maybe just a below par season 8 of GOT... \"Could have been much better\" is the general feeling...,I get why this show is so praised. The idea is simple yet very well executed. The asthetic and decors, and musics are amazing. BUT, the dialogs, the script and the acting are way over acted. Nobody talk like any of the character and it is sometimes really awkward. It is even more obvious when VIP talks. It is painfull to watch.There are all the stereotypical characters we have seen a million time : The benevolent hero, the cool/cold chick, the mysterious connection, the old wise man, the pure villain.... and when you start to think about the entire plot, nothing make sense. Also, the twist ending is way too predictable. I called it on episode 2 and then told myself \\'\\'no, they wouldnt go there, it is way too easy\\'\\'. Yep, they totally did. This show could have been made in the 80\\'s and then maybe, they would have some original idea. Aside from the premise, a lot of trope are copy paste from american\\'s thriller.I was dying lauging when the face scan his mask.,This show is a great Korean drama adventure that will make the audience at their edge all the time, well written and great acting.Hands up for Netflix & Korea for deliver this show and looking forward for more cooperation to come in the near future.Unpopular opinion: This V. I. P characters acting is dumb and the way they talk is annoying but I think a human enjoy watching other people suffering has to be dumb and have a brain damage somehow!!,Absolute masterpiece and a must watch. It has excellent premise, gripping & binge-worthy development, perfectly handle twist & turns, fantastic character arcs and overall exceptional writing and acting!It\\'s near the realm of perfection with little to complain but if I have to nitpick, my only minor gripes are:\\r\\n1. Motivation revealed in last episode could have been more...philosophical (maybe it\\'s lost in translation)\\r\\n2. VIPs acting are really bad, like...they supposed to be world\\'s richest a-holes, not jerk high schooler reading off a drama script...,Classic example of the madness of crowds. How it has become so popular so fast means there is an agenda somewhere to push this.,Good show. Interesting characters. Well produced. Stellar acting.,I fail to see what got people so hyped about this. It is slow, veeeeryyy predictable, characters not relatable at all, long winded bathetic (yes that is a word) scenes, borderline annoying characters, no skill or smarts needed only luck, very poorly written \"twists\" that fail to be twists and so on... This is a huuuggeee disappointment.,Squid Game is essentially a terrible indictment of society whereby contestants are so downtrodden and made desperate by life in the real world that they\\'re willing to enter a fabricated, deadly gameshow world to solve their real world problems with money. Although this show demonstrates that money certainly doesn\\'t solve everything like you think it will. The show also highlights that as with real current events in the early 2020s, some elites are bored and perverted and take pleasure in having people abused and exploited for their entertainment. This series has got it all, great action, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, co-operation, revenge, family, greed, horror, plot twists, suspense and some very touching moments.Everyone involved with this production should be proud of themselves, the set designers and builders, the lighting technicians, the actors, the director, the writers, the people that chose the music and costume design.,You haven\\'t seen the series, so please don\\'t rate...Saw this before all the hype, first day it came out, fell in love instantly.,A series with completely unique n innovative script ever! Portrays all human emotions of helplessness, greed, competition, violence, deceit, struggle, guilt. A true master creation at its best!,Whilst initially i took the bait like the rest of humanity but it didn\\'t take long to discover the simplistic predictable storyline & let me say \"unique\" acting performances. But let\\'s face, i don\\'t thing anything in human history is capable of living up to that nonsensical level of hype. Massive credit goes to the creation of the concept but i genuinely believe this should have been a movie not a series.,Actually, i didn\\'t watch any korean movies or series before. But i believe that no one denies that this show is one of the greatest shows \"this year at least\".,Hi, my name is sam and i haven\\'t watched any korean show or movie before but this show was the trend in 2021 so i decided to watch it and see if it was a cool show or not.Well, let\\'s talk about the story! The story was pretty damn cool and full of excitement, but there are some nonsensical points like bringing you WIFE into this game.... AGAIN!. Also, the officer, his phone did not run out of battery! It was turned on for like 3 days but the battery didn\\'t run out HOW! Speaking of the officer, why did the director create a very stupid twist at the end????????????? Why did he make the brother of the officer is the one who made the game? What a stupid twist! The twist of the player number 1 at the end of the show is WAY more clever than this. And the vip....... THOSE ARE HERE TO JUST TALK! THERE IS NO ACTING, JUST TALK! Also all of them are Americans.... wait what? How? Haven\\'t you said that this game has a lot of departments around the world? This means that the vips should have different nationalities? This is one of many many dark and nonsensical points. If just the director took a little more time to only focus on them, this show could have been the best korean short show of all time maybeat last, i can\\'t deny how much i loved this show and how much of the enthusiasm i had to watch one more episode of it, .But if you look at it logically, you would see what i mean.My final rating is 8.5/10.Is it worth watching?: yes, it is\\r\\ndo i want a second season: no, that\\'s enough\\r\\nDoes it deserve an award?: Depending on the acting and the music, yes, it does.,I like it, but I don\\'t love it. I would\\'ve loved to love it though, since it had great potential. I like the plot and characters. The set dressing is pretty cool. Even the soundtrack is pretty nice. The fact that it\\'s a Korean production just made it feel like something a bit more curious to me. But it had three predictable elements in its plot that made me like it and not love it. Without spoiling it, it involves the detective\\'s missing brother, a certain player and the outcome of the game. Another point of criticism is that I found some games to be lacking a little punch. I would still recommend to watch this series if you\\'re a fan of the genre since it is both entertaining and memorable.,The South Korean film Parasite should\\'ve gotten the same amount of hype this show received. First off cringe worthy costume designs they looked too basic, childish, and uncreative. The story had real world implications but felt like a weird lazy rip off of the movie saw with weak writing. It got so predictable and dull I didn\\'t even watch the last two episodes. Overall, watch it if you don\\'t mind cheap storytelling. If you haven\\'t seen Parasite by Bong Joon-ho, then that\\'s a better use of your time.,The American voice actors don\\'t really have the passion that the real actors have, so if you can live without the English dubbing then watch it with subtitles. Trust me, you\\'ll understand why if you rewatch parts with the English overdubs. Also, there\\'s a fair few writing issues and plot holes that may be just due to the way it was translated so it\\'s not a flawless series but it\\'s still a great series despite these letdowns.,If you have seen hostel ....then this series is just 100000000 times BETTER!!!!Unbelievable , thrill that gives you chill and makes you shrill !!!!The scenes are prolific that it stems SHOCK & AWE !MUST WATCH.,I must say I started watching this because everyone is/was talking about it. So I went in expecting not very much, but I was wrong.This show blew me away by the amazing story and the incredible performance of the actors (minus the VIP\\'s).It really strung me along till the very end and it didn\\'t bore me a second.Amazing show, very different from anything I had seen before.Overall 9/10.,It\\'s a good series. Is it as good as Alice in Borderland, not really, this one, while having more realistic qualities, is basically that series meets Parasite with a light flavoring of Saw series. Outside of the main character there isn\\'t much in the way of an engaging cast. In fact towards the end of the series you\\'re rooting against most of them. The side story was particularly laboring and disengaging. The theming is little too blatant and bordering on sophomoric. It\\'s really just not that clever, despite the hype. It is a good series, and of course being a K series social and economic injustice is deeply threaded into the theme. Like I said though, it\\'s enjoyable, worth the watch but not as thoughtful as it tries so hard to be.,Some spoilers here, and this review is before season 2 comes out, but this show was a solid 7/10 for me. There was plenty to love, as you could really get invested in some of the characters which are all very realistic in their own way. This show is aesthetically pleasing, with great directing and acting. Interesting plot that mostly delivers on the setup. Finally, the score really works well with this show and the tone is very consistent throughout.For me though, I couldn\\'t go higher than a 7 because of the, in my opinion, weak twists that happened and the lack of explanation given to some aspects of the story. The final twist was unknowingly foreshadowed with small hints, but the choice of the twist with what we were shown feels kind of forced and pointless to me. The frontman twist went nowhere, leaving you with more questions than answers, and really not much care for that character. Finally, the show has a bit of a slow start that completely focuses on Gi-Hun, which really took away the tension of who will live and die because I\\'m just thinking \"this is our main character and there\\'s only one winner\" the whole time. These things took away from my enjoyment of the show, but overall it is still great and I can see why so many people are loving it- I will be trying out season 2 when it arrives although I am slightly skeptical of where they can go from here if they focus on Gi-Hun.,About wolves and sheep in this world.Rich People playing God with the unfortunate and someone\\'s version about right and wrong.Over emotional actors.Speculation on outcomes.I gave a 6 for effort and suspense held.I did predict the ending early in the movie but not sure how others faired.Stupid ending. What, oh a sequel? Meh, I\\'ll pass.,At the end of the third episode, I felt I had enough of this show. I could not mind a message or entertainment to get me interested in the shallow plot. I also had to wonder what individuals see in this type of violence. Just could find anything to keep me interested and not turned off. Wait one thing, the first episode which was slow did give a visual of Korea and I presume Seoul. This was the worst simply put with no redeeming values. Big turnoff.,Korean TV shows are traditionally a step below their movies, which have been the best in the world for a while now. With its budget, production quality and talent Squid Game could have been the one show that got away but all is sadly ruined by Lee Jung-jae overacting pretty much every scene he\\'s in, he just doesn\\'t seem to be able to ground his character. Granted, some of the writing is over the top too, which doesn\\'t help but the director should have helped him calibrate. In comparison Gong Yoo and especially Lee Byung-hun own the screen and ooze charisma every single time despite very brief appearances.It\\'s still a good show and overall quite watchable but it\\'s just not great.,I didn\\'t think the lead actor was likeable in the first episode but found myself rooting for him after episode 2. The games were so creepy. Children\\'s games that if you lose, you die, in horrible bloody circumstances. Whittling the players down to one ultimate cash prize winner. So there\\'s a lot of violence and death. Now, this programme could have been higher rated had it not been for one thing: The VIPs. My gosh how embarrassingly cringeworthy are they! They ought to be glad their faces were mainly hidden! I\\'m not sure if it was a budgeting thing and they were hired on the cheap as western actors. Or if their performances translated better for Korean viewers, as foreign actors. I doubt it though. They really let the show down. However, i\\'ll still give it an 8 for the concept, production and delivery and the Korean actors.,This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.The only major problem I have with it is the acting.It\\'s not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see \\'fear of death\\' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting.,Squid games is another one of those concepts which we have seen quite a few times before(Battle Royale, Hunger games, Belko Experiment, Escape Room...).A bunch of people locked up in an environment where they have to battle it out to the death, all for a cash price for 45.6 billion or something.The games are all unique, all the type which we probably have played before as kids. With the added incentive of life or death there is a real intensity to these games which intrigues us throughout.The characters all have unique and relatable motivations and circumstances. They all need money for one reason or another be it for themselves, their family members , debts, etc.The characters surprisingly are very well written and rounded up which is what keeps us hooked right unitl the end and perhaps seperates this show from other violent shows.The show throws concepts of morality in the face of adversity, consumerism, democracy, class separation, gender equality, all very subtly and naturally weaving and fitting into the story without taking any unneccesary stops.It lets you form your own opinion of these concepts and themes instead of drilling its own politics into you.From the standards of storytelling in modern times its Oscar worthy!The ending revelations perhaps felt uninspired even if they were executed well(driven mostly by the actors performances and direction),\\r\\nthe twists and turns ranged from genuinely shocking, emotional to \\'Havent we seen that somewhere else?\\'.Yes the plot twists at the end remind you of Escape Room perhaps even of Hunger Games or Battle Royale but the writing and character development is what elevates the show a notch above.I dont think we need a sequel....the show is clearly one of the best of the year.,Overhyped show for CW teens. Don\\'t trust other reviews.,This is one of the best series I have ever seen. Prepare yourself, however, to be anxious and have your heart ripped out thanks to episode 6.,It would probably be more thought-provoking if it weren\\'t for the glaring errors.Also, it proved to be rather something of a bait and switch. First, they say it\\'s all about pulling oneself up by one\\'s bootstraps but it turns out to be something quite different. Everyday, vulgar banality is all it was, after all.,To be honest, the first time I found out about \"Squid Game\" was when I was traveling home and a passenger on my bus was watching it on his cell phone. After doing some research to confirm, I tried to avoid spoilers until I could see it, but in less than 24 hours the entire internet was filled with it. That forced me to abstain from watching the series for a few days until the boom subsided.After finally observing the 9 chapters, I can share the following points. Personally, I really liked the social message that the series shared, of how they gave Korean children\\'s games of the 70s and 80s a dark twist, and the chemistry between the characters and their individual development. I would have easily given it an 8, if not for two downsides.The first was the way the story was told. At first, it was able to take off without any problem but it became unstable until the end of the season, which in my opinion could have been better. Apart from that, the police side-plot must also have been developed better. They gave him considerable screening time, only to stop with a clichéd Star Wars-type moment? I mean, what the heck?The second is related to the characters. Although the characters had good chemistry with each other and a good, but slow individual development, the same cannot be said about the audience; since they felt a bit generic and the charisma was almost non-existent (especially with the main character).In short, \"The Squid Game\" is not a bad series, but I consider it highly overrated from what I had to see. If in such case Netflix renews it for a Season 2, it is necessary that improvements be made, especially with the writing part. I give it a 6.5/10.,First of all, this show will gut you like a fish and use your soul for chum. It\\'s ultra-violent, graphic, and so intense that sometimes I felt sick. I cried a few times but mostly I was just becoming as damaged as the contestants. This show will MESS. YOU. UP. It is hella dark, hella bleak, and once you start it, you won\\'t be able to stop until you know who wins the game. I need Season 2, please.This is NOT Alice in Borderland!!! This is NOT The Hunger Games!!! This isn\\'t Battle Royale.Yes, the same most basic of premise is there. But this show stands alone.Watch it at your own peril. But Watch It.,Brilliance at its finest. Correlating with modern times and capitalism, the symbolism and valuable lessons in this show make this emotional thriller a must see. Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk along with his talented cast, create intense dialogue, beautiful visuals and scenes that are absolutely unforgettable. Watching this was refreshing and exciting.,To be honest, it\\'s cliche, nonsensible & horrible art-design. Whole storyline is quite boring. We can see the aim-system bypassed the old man at the very beginning, and we know there\\'s something on it.It get the high ratings, but beneath it\\'s not a bad tv drama series, and that\\'s all of it - just a not-bad one.,There are a lot of holes in the plot...Many, maybe too many.But I had a nice time, which is the objective of entertainment.My grade:\\r\\nActing (Korean style): 3/3\\r\\nScenario (some flaws): 2/3\\r\\nProduction (inconsistencies): 2/3\\r\\nNo cancel culture, gay couples, or save the planet BS: 1/1.,This is a show written for and by mainstream human brains that are obsessed with social connections, and enjoy spending every waking minute contemplating about the meaning and weight behind social interactions.It is not good material for those of us who repurpose our neurons for more interesting things.It is possible to skip 70% of the material without losing sight of the simple story construct, and you still get to claim to have watched it.,This show was amazing, apart from the thrill, drama and violence, it tried to show the social inequalities that people have to live with and they fight to survive! Yet another Korean masterpiece.,The first 5 episodes are cool. Then the rest is sooooo boring , lonnnng and predictable. Dont let me start about the finale which is a mess and dosen\\'t make sense.Thank god succession is coming back tonight, a real show with talent .,I thought this Season of Squid Game was done so well. So many emotions and characters to follow. I never thought of South Korea as coming out with something so good...such a pleasant surprise. I can\\'t wait for Season 2 (perfect ending to a great Season-obviously there will be a 2nd Season).Great job-keep up the good work!!Anyone worried about it being in Korean-just watch in English and put English subtitles on. You\\'ll never know the difference.,Right off the bat, I smelled something fishy when Player 1 was actually Player 1. There were plenty of plotholes such as:Gi-hun owed the loan sharks and he tells them he\\'ll pay them in full \"next month\" but we learn that he hasn\\'t touched his winnings from the account so how did he pay them off?Diagnosed with diabetes and nearing amputation, Gi-hun\\'s mother is not even in the hospital upon his return but dead on the floor. How long has she been dead?The cop has played every move smartly up until sending the evidence to the police which ruins the whole angleThe cop\\'s brother \"won\" the game but then becomes the Front Man and then kills his cop brother? Why?How did Gi-hun know exactly where to find the girl\\'s little brother?All winners presumably are allowed to go free. What stops them from uncovering this game conspiracy? If any of the past winners accumulated together, they could bring down the corporationIn the first instance, Gi-hun could have asked the cop to insert a tracking device on Gi-hun so when he went to the game the second time, the police could track his locationThere was no rule against crawling in the 6th game when they\\'re crossing the glass. Two people can stand on one tempered tile while one person is crawling ahead. If the glass ahead breaks, the person with them (behind them) can just pull the person who starts falling by their legs and hoist them back upTo my knowledge, tempered glass doesn\\'t shatter. It webs up as we see on a car\\'s windshield. Even so, a huge chunk of glass hits the girl and she bleeds profusely which doesn\\'t seem plausible at allThere are presumably 456 players when the games are starting. They could have easily constructed a human pyramid to reach the money inside the chamber. A few of them could have blocked the doors to stop the guards from entering. Alternatively, the players could have also overpowered the guards by their sheer number alone.Why didn\\'t the cop trigger the bombs when he was escaping?When the cop sneaks into the van as a player, the guards are scanning the players behind their ears. What exactly are they scanning for?,Ok, I have to get this off my chest. It really annoys me when people just don\\'t give a realistic review of movies and tv shows because giving something 10 and saying \\'best thing ever!\\' or a 1 (or even 0) and saying \\'worst thing ever!\\' serve no purpose except to feel the gap some people have in their life for a hobby... I find it especially annoying when people rate something zero and say \\'I was bored after 10 minutes so turned off\\' - hey buddy, don\\'t review it then if you\\'re not mature enough to invest some time! Go watch some Tik Tok videos instead!Ok, rant over lol.I put this on for the sake of having something in the background while I worked from home. It was a huge mistake as I kept concentrating on the show with work in the background! Sorry boss :) I did however change it to other \"stuff\" when I realised it was a show I wanted to watch.The basic premise is simple - people with huge debts and nothing really to live for are offered a part in 6 games and the winner gets huge amounts of money. Simples. What they don\\'t know is that they might die...I don\\'t know how they do it, but Korea just nails it when it comes to creating characters that are fallible but likeable. They even make bad guys, real a-holes, somehow relatable and fleshed out so they\\'re not just one dimensional villains.Anyway, I won\\'t spoil anything for anyone except to say it\\'s really very good :) It doesn\\'t glorify the deaths, they\\'re grim and matter of fact and as the series progresses, because they\\'ve developed characters and you\\'ve invested in them then their deaths hit pretty hard :( I sort of assumed that more would survive but this feels like it\\'s completely self contained like they didn\\'t expect a second series.Watch it, enjoy it - or not - just don\\'t come in and review it like a child afterwards.,Dong-hyuk Hwang starts out with what seems to be a typical Korean drama and by the end of it we\\'ve been through \"Battle Royale\", \"Hunger Games\", \"Eyes Wide Shut\", and a Bond movie - complete with plot twists, Kubrik-esque visual easter-eggs, and social commentary delivered with a side-dish of disturbing trauma.Squid game is about a group of people recruited to play lethal games for prize money, but it is more than that. It is a commentary about the nature of human competition, the endless class war, the illusion of wealth. Read into it a bit more closely and you\\'ll all about the levers of control our governments and rulers have over us all.The most obvious theme is the love and sacrifice that others have to make for us to succeed in life. Some people seem to think that this is a critique of capitalism, but capitalism isn\\'t a zero-sum game like Squid Game is.With this deep commentary underlying the action - being carefully shown and not told to us - Squid Game is an unmissable watch.Negatives? The ending was a bit flat. It flirted with the idea of tying up all lose ends into a satisfying thematic conclusion - but in the end, the actual conclusion was a little less than satisfying and opened up more questions than it actually resolved. That\\'s perfect for a sequel season - if we get one.,A very well directed series with not so many flaws. I loved the acting of all thr main characters and this series is sort of an emotional one than anything else. This shows the problems each character is facing in their day to day lives and how they were emotionally drawn into this SQUID GAME. I\\'m loving it and have stopped watching the cheesy MONEY HEIST.,What a show. Keeps you gripped all the way through. Brilliant concept, well acted (other than the VIPs) and you never get too connected to one character as they are all horrible so you don\\'t get too upset when one dies like in other shows.,Imagine, that you\\'re jumping on glass plates 200 meters above the ground, and your game mates pushing you to do it more quickly... And you volunteered to participate in this brutal game. Good story. Pity that not every episode was interesting enough.,Nice and innovative concept of this korean web series. From start to end it is nice to watch. Also very emotional at the end. Very few series has such a new concept.,Kinda sad Korean dramas had to \"westernize\" themselves this much to go trending. The show isn\\'t bad but it isn\\'t jaw dropping. It has none of the charms kdrama lovers enjoy that are exclusive to the Korean culture. This is another western show with Korean people in it.,If not the best new show on TV--and it may be exactly that--certainly one of the most outrageous. Set in South Korea, it stars Lee Jung-jae as a hardcore gambler in debt to the mob with child support payments he can\\'t maintain and medical bills for his ailing mom that he can no longer afford to pay. When he is offered a chance to make a not-so-small fortune by competing against several hundred other desperate souls in a high-stakes series of childrens\\' games, he grabs it--with absolutely no idea of what he has signed up for. At first, there\\'s a repetitiveness to it all--everyone competes, the losers are massacred in a horrible bloodbath, the winners move on, rinse and repeat--and, terrifying as the story quickly becomes, you may start wondering if that\\'s all there is. But then episodes six and seven come along, the suspense is ratcheted up even higher, the pool of players is winnowed down to a precious few, and the action really takes off. (Who knew that an ordinary game of marbles could turn into such a nailbiter?) The premise is brilliant, the acting is magnificent (Jung-jae, with his large eyes and expressive face, leads an extraordinarily talented cast), and the stunt work is amazing. Not for the faint of heart--there are more corpses here than at your local boneyard--but if you can stomach the more cringeworthy moments, \"Squid Game\" is quite a ride. The ending is a jaw-dropper, too. It\\'s already been renewed for a second season, and I can\\'t wait.,This series isn\\'t overrated to me. It\\'s what I needed to see.Hldhyorljycljdtufuepiilufidyksutdhl.Kgtkskydytiskgsuifoydlhydkhl\\r\\nKhkhsgkxitskgitsgxiykhkykykgkgkylhkykykyludykkykykykykyskylulukukydludlukydiyljiycljiymhgk.,Squid Game offers a breath of fresh air into 2021\\'s drama/thrillers.With unpredictable twists around every corner, excellent acting and writing, this show is taking the world by storm - and for a good reason.,I love this show. The series is very tense, with steaks being very high. It also has a lot of commentary on some of the toxicity in competition and discrimination. I loved this, but I have one major issue. 3 of the episodes aren\\'t good, and this isn\\'t the kind of series where you can skip over one episode and still be able to follow the story. I enjoyed this, but I\\'m not really going to watch it again.,It had good moments till vip episode but overall games sucked and too childish and then the ending and last few episodes sucked..........................,*Roughly Translated From Brazilian Portuguese.Series Review - Squid Game (Season 1).I confess that I went to watch this series thinking it would not be good. As much as she has been voted the most viewed in the world recently, I was too suspicious of her potential, thinking that it could be a shallow plot, just a \"popocão\" to marathon. I was wrong.The show is very balanced, it has a plot, it has good characters, and it grips you in a very smooth way, where you\\'re tempted to keep watching, episode after episode.Overall, it\\'s guaranteed fun. The show\\'s aesthetic alone tells us not to take it too seriously, so don\\'t. Skip the details and have fun.Out of respect for the great old series, which were extremely well done, I won\\'t give it a higher rating, but it\\'s a very good series.Good for a marathon on a Saturday after lunch, alone or with others.Rating: 4/5 - Very good series.,The movie is allegorical to various ideas, from brutality of the people to that of the social, financial and political systems. From gaming the system, to playing the system, and being played by the system. Is all Korean in the representation of those ideas after that. After watching a couple of Old Boy(s) sort of movies, the thriller of plot turns and the display of certain characters seem too repetitive.Nevertheless, it is well-made. And it has the potential of becoming the best show worldwide if they iinternationalize it. There are kids\\' games in my country that have the potential of being far more brutal with the proper setting.Bit is atrociius writing this revuew in Android.,Sadly and stupidly I watched every episode.Easily predictable on what happens and who\\'s who.The acting is woeful with even worse dubbing. If I can remember who recommended this to me, i\\'d throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting 9 hours of my life on utter dross.It\\'s not unique it\\'s not different. It\\'s all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surpriseIf I can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done.,Loses points only for the final reveal, which was a bit anticlimactic, and the bafflingly awful, stilted acting of the American VIPs.Otherwise, definitely worth the watch.,People have been rightly comparing this gem to the Hunger Games, and to some extent they\\'re right; however, to oversimplify the show as another \"Dystopian Future Game Show\" drama risks looking over the masterful character work, the wildly impressive production design and cinematography, and of course the top-tier acting from everyone involved (yes, that includes the VIPs).Everyone involved in making this, please take a bow. I look forward to where this story goes.,Entertaining enough. The main character is super annoying. The end (explanation) is plain weak and goes ridiculously against human nature, therefore it weakens the premise of the \\'games\\'.,Squid Game could have been an amazing show, but at an average of 55 episodes, it\\'s filled with so much bloat.It needed to be 6-8 half hour episodes.It is fantastic, stylishly shot and has so much going for it, but boy does it need an edit. Episode 2 was entirely pointless and ridiculous in the extreme.So much I could say, but I\\'d love to see a vastly cut down version, or a 2 hour movie - the running length is really the only thing spoiling what could have been truly legendary.,This is definitely the most diverse drama I\\'ve watched it really is like no other drama I binged it in two days it kept me hooked first episode hopefully there is a second season because whilst the concept was gruesome and inhumane I really enjoyed watching it.,With nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey (Blue Danube score and depth of meaning regarding some of the eliminations) and Battle Royale (an all out fight for survival), whilst some of the acting leaves much to be desired, the concept and plot raises this to be an addictive, binge worthy series.Granted I watched this with the English dubbing, which may lose some of the intended dialogue, but the main characters give a boost to the otherwise mediocre acting of some of the other members of the cast.The story - albeit an old one of man versus man in a primordial sense - is engaging and keeps you interested. The side story of the masked individuals is perhaps an unnecessary addition, and I found it disengaging from the main plot. That being said, if you ignore it and focus on the primary plot, it can be forgiven.Overall 8/10. Watch it and enjoy!,Great acting, very interesting storyline. As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am watching the show without having to rely on the subtitles. As someone who is also fluent in English, I am reading the subtitles as well. I cannot believe that this high budget production is ruined by shockingly poor translation. For non-Korean speakers who must rely on the subtitles, please believe me when I tell you that the actual dialog is not that poor. It\\'s shame that Netflix does not have any QC over translated subtitles.,I must say, Squid Game kind of entertained me! The concept was really fun and intriguing and that led to some very fun and memorable scenes.However, I felt that there could have been so many better ways for this show to go. Like I said it is a great concept but I thought the execution could have been so much better and more enjoyable. It all just becoming so predictable with every game who would survive and who wouldn\\'t. Especially with the game in episode 6. The moment the game was announced I knew what would happen. That didn\\'t mean it was a bad episode because still, some stuff happens which was nicely executed. But because it was so predictable for me it kind of ruined the great moments.The acting was decent and some of the characters were semi enjoyable. But I felt that the whole cop storyline was so slow and boring. And the twist for him at the end didn\\'t work and was just so unnecessary.Overall the show was fun to watch but defiantly nothing special. I have no idea why there is so much hype for this and I\\'m afraid with more seasons coming it will only milk it out as much as it can.I would rate this show a 6.5/10.,We all know this Show broke records and became really famous, and for good reason. It has a really good concept and Good actors. The Korean actors atleast, the VIPs literally made me want to punch something, so cheesy it was painful to watch. But other than that the rest of the show was awesome and fun to watch.Also I hate episode 6.,The plot is super interesting! It offers you almost identical storyline to the one of Alice in borderland, but it\\'s even better. The characters are all round, none of them are flat. The gore is great and it does leave you on the brink of being creeped out by the events it creates. Love every bit of it. Moreover, the plot twist at the end is really well done, if you keep your eyes peeled at every little detail, you can figure it out yourself, but it\\'s not really all that simple.Really recommend it to everyone. Very interesting and can\\'t wait for season 2.,If you like Battle Royale, The Prisoner, Hunger Games and a good drama - this is for you.Set in South Korea in the present day, this series is a stark look at what people will do when society has failed them - richly character driven and with a wonderfully original take on the sinister, this is a Netflix series that has depth, drama, entertainment and shock-value.It\\'s a not afraid to be a slow burner at times, but the mystery and slight surrealist nature of \\'The Game\\' drives your attention throughout.It\\'s worth watching and taking time over. Really recommended.,Wow! Amazing show worth watching for sure. Concept was so good. The VIPs doe.. their acting was weird. Other than that the whole show keeps you on the edge.. the characters were really well played and I can\\'t wait for the next season.,After reading and seeing stories like Liar Game, Kaiji and multiple Battle Royale clones over 20 years ago this one doesn\\'t bring anything new to the table. Not only isn\\'t it the first, but Squid Game isn\\'t even among the best of its kind.To be fair my main critique isn\\'t the old concept. A more glaring issue is with some core points like the Jigsaw like reveal that I found rather predictable.The ending itself and Seong Gi-Hun\\'s decision is incomprehensible as well. If you just think back to all the games it\\'s clear that he only survived by luck or help or pity from the other contestants. There\\'s really only one game to give him full credit for. Taking this into account his decision at the end of joining the next game doesn\\'t make any sense.Aside from some character inconsistencies or rather incomprehensible acts by some characters like Seong Gi-Hun, Oh Il-nam and Front Man the characters were really great and fleshed out. Definitely one of the best things about this show.,This is one of the best shows I\\'ve watched. The production quality all around is superb. The directing, cinematography, the script, the overall writing, the cast, and above all, the acting. Every single detail was chosen to perfection. Even watching in English, it\\'s amazingly well-developed. Full 10/10, one of the best shows in years. Go watch it!,It gets one extra star for being somewhat creative at times. But otherwise I have no idea how anyone can stand this show.The main character is so awful and unlikable that it kind of ruins the show from the beginning. Why would we even care if he lives or dies? He\\'s an unbelievably crap person. The acting is atrocious all around. Doesn\\'t matter if you watch it in Korean or dubbed, it\\'s forced like high schoolers trying out for the drama program.Plot twists? There are a few, but I had no trouble predicting them once the show gave you enough hints.The \"Game\" itself? Boring and drawn out.Couldn\\'t finish the show but I heard the last episode sucks anyway.,Battle Royale, As The Gods Will (literally about kid\\'s games in a death challenge environment), Alice in Borderland, Hunger Games, etc. And those are just the Asian ones...This really didn\\'t do anything special or anything unique. The story dragged on during some moments, wouldn\\'t be surprised if they were trying to stretch out the episodes. Episode 6 was the best one and had some of the show\\'s best acting.The last 3 episodes were really bad and uninspired and clearly just meant to setup a season 2 which is annoying. All the character arcs are thrown out the window, a police officer investigating this deadly game has a lackluster ending, and the reveals.... meh? The \\'protagonist\\' learns nothing by the end of the film, so there\\'s zero character arc.I\\'ll give it a 6. It\\'s entertaining to watch the games and their thought process but I can\\'t give it anymore than that thanks to the lackluster ending. Now an ending can be disappointing but I want rate an entire series on JUST an ending (like Game of Thrones). But the fact this did nothing new at all and flat out copied movies. People are saying some of the above movies I mentioned are fantasy, but there\\'s another movie I can\\'t think of where people volunteer to play for money in a very realistic setting that is basically the same thing...Nothing new, acting is OKAY, some major plotholes or scratch your head moments, and not a good conclusion. I know they\\'re setting up for season 2, but how they set it up is pretty stupid. And I don\\'t think it needs to go there to begin with.,So good to see a truly entertaining TV show for a change, enjoyed every single episode, a big round of applause for Korean entertainment. And don\\'t worry about the bad VIPs, they\\'re not in it for long and the masks are beautiful.,Gripping South Korean take on a Battle Royale theme, based around playing games for a huge cash prize. The Aesthetics are memorable & the competition relentless. Kudos to Netflix for taking such original regional content on. Its like nothing I have seen before.,This show is incredible and sad at the same time because it shows us human nature in a world dominated by the value of money, how far we can go by having money on one side and how sick those who have money are, in short we are doomed for money.,Takes the battle royale Hunger games style approach coupled with high stakes children\\'s style games and creates an intriguing story of debt and greed. Shows how people can change when they are pushed so far. You will end up loving and hating characters, and be surprised at the plot twists. This is one of my new favorite shows. I hope Season 2 is as good or better than the first.,I do love Korean music, movies and series. So I\\'m overwhelmed and happy that Squid Game gets so much hype and is currently the most streamed series on Netflix. I\\'ve seen Ig Stories of my friends loving Squid Game. Even though they never watched Korean series or films before.I grant all the success from heart to Hwang Dong-hyuk. His plot for the series was rejected many times over the years by a lot of companies. They didn\\'t believed in Squid Game.What I live about Squid Game is that it deals with pain & desperation. It shows what people are willing to do to get money.The actors were impressive during the entire season. Also recognized some familiar faces.The plot is not predictable and never lost it magic. I was there from the first to the last second fully focused on the screen.Squid Game & Move To Heaven are the best series on Netflix.10/10.,First of all. I like Korean cinema. Memories of murder and Burning are among my top 10 favorite films of all time.The show has been hyped everywhere and I actually didn\\'t want to see it right away. But so many people told me to watch. So I watched.I try to make it simple and I don\\'t make it up.I knew the guy in the black mask was the brother of the police guy from the 3rd episode on. Why would the black masked guy be the only one with a weird voice.I knew right away that the old guy has something to do with the whole thing. It came to my mind instantly. He was the only old guy and kind of wise and all and also in the marble game episode he was the only character not being shown being shot.Yes it was thrilling here and there, yes the performances were good and yes I wanted to keep watching. But to me it was pretty predictable.Every character did exactly what I expected in almost every situation. The bad guy with the snake tattoo just kept being an idiot. The crazy woman he slept with yep being annoying and loud. And so on.And this goes along with every thing in the show.Examples:Marble game again. There is this husband guy who kind of killed his wife who wants to hang himself. He hangs himself. Success. It would\\'ve been funnier if it didn\\'t work and he had to keep playing. Even though I know he wasn\\'t an important character.The glass bridge game. The broker guy who also fooled Ali pushes one person into death right in front of the last step to safety. He pushes the guy, the guy falls down and dies. He jumps and wins. I would\\'ve loved that at one point maybe two of the glass surfaces were to be the weaker ones. That would\\'ve been unexpected. He pushes the guy and thinks he\\'s safe, jumps, but the other one breaks too. WOW. Didn\\'t happen.Police guy trying to escape all the sudden. Why so ever. He looked for his brother, couldn\\'t find him and then leaves. They look after him in the weird tunnel in the cupboard. They follow him. They see that one oxygen divers tank is missing so they assume he went diving. And what did he do ? He went diving. I would\\'ve like that he had maybe hidden one tank somewhere to fool them. Didn\\'t happen.The whole show is just based on its whole premise. Violence and shock. And bright classic music in weird situations. And that just repeats.To me it really went difficult when the \\'VIPs\\' showed up. They were super cringeworthy. I couldn\\'t barely watch and listen to their generic lines. And why would they come to almost the last game ? So they watched people running over a bridge and two guys fighting on a rainy playground. Wow. They should\\'ve been introduced earlier. They weren\\'t even needed at all. If you\\'d take them out it wouldn\\'t have changed anything and it would\\'ve even be more mysterious in my opinion. I doesn\\'t match with what the old guy says in the end and it is also not further explained.And then the show ends with a father not going to see his daughter. Instead coloring his hair red and apparently wants to play again. Instead of going to see his daughter and make it up again. Right.. Who cares about children. She can wait another year. Stoopid kid.I also had a problem with the portrayal of the Arab character. He was portrayed as super stupid, almost retarded. He didn\\'t even know what even and odd numbers are. And his name was Ali Abdul. It\\'s like having a French character and calling him \\'Guy Frenchman\\'.However it was still a lot better than 80% of Netflix stuff. And I will watch the second season if it comes. I also liked \"Sweet Home\" which is also a Korean show with monsters and all around one house. It kind of went nowhere in the end, but I actually liked that one more.,It wasn\\'t actually bad,but just like any netflix show\\r\\nIt\\'s never good enough/great\\r\\nIt\\'s mostly an overhyped show that\\'s (at best cases) A time killer\\r\\nSo scenes were really long that you don\\'t lose anything by skipping a minute or two\\r\\nSome actors were really really horrible\\r\\nEdgy and like anime characters\\r\\nA bully is 24/7 a criminal/bully\\r\\nA woman who uses people is 24/7 this way\\r\\nAnd if there\\'s a game that\\'s based on people fighting to keep the bet on,why would they let them kill each other?And the whole brother murder thing is really dumb..and somr plots are dumb like a couple coming back again and being surprised they\\'ll kill each other while it\\'s supposed to happen at one point or the other,and people repeating that they\\'ll get out together while the rule was you can\\'t get out together and keep the money...and the VIPs arc was waaayyyy too dumb.,I really loved the first few episodes, but soon the magic started waning for me. There were too many predictable and pointless subplots, and the level of melodrama started to get too high for my taste. Also, there were a couple of outrageously homophobic moments.All in all; the show was good and I enjoyed it, but expected something more based on all the hype.,Korean shows movies are the best no doubt...some are getting a bit too much Hollywood in em is getting scary...bit slow compared to Alice in borderlands...indian guy is making this ugly with overacting and bending down unnaturally as if he\\'s gonna fall down... multiculturalism is ok but avoid these guys in good natural Korean shows and movies...they make it like Bollywood crap...rest is good.,...just because the violence, blood and gore were too gratuitous for my taste. But the story was so intriguing yet disturbing we just couldn\\'t stop watching. Looking forward to Season 2 even though I\\'ll hide my eyes for lots of it.,It\\'s one of the best series I have seen in my life\\r\\nThe VIPs give some boring scenes to the show\\r\\nBut it still the show is 100% worth watching\\r\\nIf you have a good heart\\r\\nI watched it in 1 day.,Just binge the whole 9 episodes\\r\\nAnd I will probably say it is one of the best series you will look after\\r\\nThe VIPs give some boring scenes to the show\\r\\nBut the show is still 100%worth\\r\\nIf you have already watched Parasite and loved it this series is for you\\r\\nI will not recommend you this series in only one condition if you don\\'t have a powerful heart.,Incredible story and performances layered over a timely, universal theme about the dangerously increasing wealth gap. Excellent visuals (I imagine black/pink soldier costumes will be popular) and character development. May develop trust issues after watching.,\"Squid Game\" is a show meant to appeal to its viewers twisted inner child. It\\'s not just the games themselves, but the brightly coloured, oversize playground in which the players are forced to live and compete. The storytelling is relatively simple and straightforward. And the satirical elements about the evil billionaires who come to bet on the game can at times feel like how a grade schooler.,This series is extremely good, the character I love the most in it have to be player 1. My rating 8/10.,Yea sorry alert from those ( who I think may have struggled due to language and culture barriers so nobody\\'s fault really ) the series was one of the best things I\\'ve been seen . I\\'m pooped I watch it in two days and I need a holiday . I like to think I cry at things when it\\'s needed but I\\'m either going though something subconsciously right now or this series just got me ... got me bad... I blubbered at without a doubt the most heartbreaking episode ( 6) I\\'ve ever witnessed from a show . I was a mess .... literal snot everywhere and sobbing noises which concluded at the end of the dining episode .. anyways I\\'m off to chill coz I\\'m shredded and need to be ok for a wedding this week. Bravo actors , writers , directors and everyone else it was a triumphal . Bravo.,Decent show, good acting and cast, definitely best K-drama I\\'ve ever seen, I would probably never rewatch it but it isn\\'t necessarily bad, it is definitely overrated though, I liked the violence and gore, also unlike most K dramas the plot doesn\\'t seem like it was put together in a day and the movie doesn\\'t look like it was filmed by a teenager with an old camera that they found in their basement, also the editing/green screen is a lot better than expected, and most of the actors are hot so they made it easy to watch hahahah.. Also it isn\\'t too long, nor is it too short, which is good because I can\\'t watch things for a prolonged amount of time.,I have seen Battle Royale and all the Hunger Games. So I see the comparison to those well constructed films. But this film\\'s characters have the emotional and mental capacity of teenagers.If it were teens it may have been more believable. Every plot point was predictable to a point I was yelling at the tv and the actors performances for many scenes was overdone. It was way too long for such a simple idea that has already been done before and much better in other films.And most every character is un likable. Even the main one is so lost 90% of the time that you lose interest in his redemption.,Squid Games received a lot of buzz since it came out and it is easy to understand why. Around 400 people who have their own financial problems decide to join a tournament, in which they have to play kids games where the losers will be killed. The premise is similar to franchises such as the hunger games, and other violent movies that became popular after that franchise.And throughout the first couple of episodes we get kind of the same adrenaline filled experiences: the games are silly but due to the fact you get killed when you loose there is automatically tension. And eventhough it is pretty clear who will survive the first few games, audience still get what they want; a high body count and enough gore.When the stakes are getting higher, you start to realize that the show has more similarities to \\'the most dangerous game\\' and \\'The Cabin in the Woods\\'. And without going too much into spoilers, the power distance between certain characters is present in all these three names. And soon you start to realize that it is a bold move for an American company (Netflix) to produce such anti-American series. I just wish they stocked with this idea.Unfortunately, and maybe I am a bit too harsh in ranking it this low because of this, they completely flipped the premise on his head towards the end. And everything they build up in the previous episodes is wasted by a cheap plot twist that literally does not make sense at all. Don\\'t get me wrong, the games are fun and there is plenty of tension, but it doesn\\'t add up like The Cabin in The woods ended. The anti American propaganda is completely thrown out, and that is a huge dissapointment.Pros: the games, the violence, references to inequality\\r\\nCons: plot twist, predictability, ending.,It\\'s not that good as everybody says, it was a good concept but... It\\'s just not that good and overrated -, _-, My review has to have at least 150 characters co i will say a fun fact: ants doesn\\'t have lungs.,It took a minute to get started but once it did, I was hooked. With than being said, the winner pissed me off. He was so moral that he oozed of stupidity. Him winning was an insult to all those who fought and lost and died. He indulged in a year long, self absorbed pity party. Had I saw the ending first, I wouldn\\'t have bothered watching any of it.,Series lost its thrill after 5th Episode\\r\\nJust an average show.,If you\\'re looking for the stereotypical K-Drama with romance, no cussing, nudity, sex, or gore, DO NOT watch this. Netflix has absolutely smashed the Korean television stereotype out of the park - in a good way. The twists and shock that this series has is mind-bending. It will have your jaw on the floor after each episode. I\\'d say my only gripe is the open ending. I know 99% of K-Dramas don\\'t get a second season, but I REALLY hope for a continuation with this one.,After the relentless hype, gave it a try but after one episode got bored.Its production is stylish, well acted but the premise is too unrealistic, ok even if you buy the fact that somehow a group can organise such murderous games, if it had an ounce of realism, after the massacre of the first game, 90% of the survivors would be too shocked and ptsd to talk never mind vote onto whether continue or not, and then ofc the vote is dead heat and down to last vote. Poor poor writing.Gave up end of 2nd episode.Just shows world we live in now, hype over quality.,Probably one of the most cliché, \"battle royale\" kind of storyline... BUT... It was still very gripping, intense, and entertaining. Definitely a binge worthy show! I can really see the typical K-drama elements in this show - you know, the unnecessary and far-fetched plot twist that almost makes you feel like it\\'s trying to make up for something? Yeah, that. I could probably list all the cliché and predictable moments in this show but I don\\'t want to spoil it for anyone.However, I can\\'t deny the fact that this really did get me binge watching for 2 days. Perhaps, it\\'s the great acting or the overly indulgent storyline - I\\'m not sure but I was hooked.,Personally found it to be somewhat of a combination of Saw, Hunger Games and Parasite, though very original in its own way.A great new TV show to binge (but maybe not with the family),This is a must-watch series . It\\'s very unique and it had me at the edge of my bed right throughout the season. The ending was not expected, but it was very interesting and I can\\'t wait for season 2.,If you haven\\'t seen Korean movies or shows before hand, you will blown away from this show. Squid Games is well crafted to be enjoyable to what show about human demons and family. The end was predictable (as I have seen other Korean films and shows), something won\\'t be right, there is no happy end at no cost. This was good show compared to any poor attempt to create anything original (*cough cough American shows ). I hope this cultural exchange will help the viewers to see other types of screen play and to learn to distinguish the good from the absolute trash.,The acting in Squid Game is phenomenal. I\\'ve seen so many negative reviews based on the acting of the VIPS - in which you BARELY even see. It\\'s the typical rich people acting - is it worth an Oscar... no, but the acting from the Korean cast is worthy of awards no doubt.Squid Game is a fun, fast paced ride I would take again. Highly recommend!,I don\\'t know what to say except this series is perfection. It\\'s original and it draws you in if you give it a chance.,Not original at all but refreshing to see this theme played by good Corean actors.Apparently the gender and bla agenda is not a must for Corean series. Which is fine by me.,I must say i\\'m a big fan of kdram since childhood . And this is another level of kdrama.,The first episode is absolutely ridiculous and enjoyable but this is so horribly filmed. People that are shot for red light greenlight didn\\'t move and those that did didn\\'t get shot. If your gonna make the game high stakes at least FILM the correct actors/extras.,DefinitelyThe director is a fan of Playstation.>.<,What is it with Japanese and Korean Culture ....they love torture and humiliation.Like their game shows there is always an element of sadistic danger...look how they treated prisoners of war...,Unlike some other comments, this is LIKE other things I\\'ve already seen or heard of. It\\'s a built on a bunch of different already used ideas, and put together into a smart package that pleases the directed target group (which is basically everyone), which was *told* to watch and enjoy this show. Marketing wise these creators hit the jackpot and the hype train is real.Almost any fast going series can get really captivating and easy to binge nowadays, and the only thing original is that this one got to the extreme when it comes to exposure and word-of-mouth.I\\'m not saying it\\'s a bad series but when the hype is over and people might reflect again it will probably be viewed as the 6 to 7 rated series that it is. Those who can recite the happenings in the series a month after watching it are welcome to prove me wrong though.,Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the \"kids games\" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization\\'s facility that houses so many people. As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show.,This programme will be dividing viewers opinions the works over, but in my humble one, it is outstanding.A concept that has been done before but never with this level of death and destruction as far as I can Recall.Some of the best drama is coming from overseas currently and we must not forget that every country has brilliant story tellers and filmmakers.If you are watching this in English language then some of the dubbed dialogue will appear awkward and crass but overall it all comes together to make compelling viewing but a few great plot twists within.Maybe this is a one-off series but I feel the door has been left open just enough to bring it back should someone like Netflix decide to pour in more cash. But maybe we do not need another series...,Seong is going to the squid game again with his red hair but already has his money won for the first time but after losing all of his friends and his brother he blames himself because the death of her mother will he\\'s gonna make it again.,The Chinese/Korean actors and actresses are absolutely amazing! They make everything just feel so real and believable, yes the English voice acting is a bit off but please believe me when I say there are shows with MUUUCH worse voice acting. Watched the entire season in 1 day and WOW what a emotional Rollercoaster filled with thrills and connections to the characters! Awesome Awesome Awesome show.,Positives:\\r\\nThe concept of Koreans competes in dangerous children\\'s games to win money is original and interesting.Gi-Hun\\'s ironic smile.Honeycomb is my favorite game in Squid Game, front of Red Light, Green Light and Marbles.The ending is \"To be continued...\" and I can\\'t wait for Season 2.The fight of Gi-Hun and Sang-Woo is amazing.Fly Me to the Moon is beautifully great.Likeable characters, except the VIPs\\r\\nThe old man smiles during the games, and epic twist that he\\'s the host of the games.I loved the soundtrack, such as Way Back Then, Pink Soldiers, Unfolded..., and Needles and Dalgona.Negatives:\\r\\nThe V. I. Ps are weird and unlikeable.Deok-Su is mean-spirted and a selfish man.Fantastic series (100/100) (I can\\'t wait for Season 2 where Gi-Huns gets revenge on the games),I adored this show, the colour theme was absolutely phenomenal and so aesthetic YET terrifying, however... the VIP\\'s could not act, but i\\'m not going to let the VIP\\'s spoil the entire show.,The poor and the actors are very realistic however the vips ruined everything with the terrible acting.,This is the best thriller which I have seen till now.Vera level entertainmentStarting to end full entertainment and suspense.Netflix proves its best.Waiting for next season.,Squid game is a well-crafted show engineered to appeal to western audience. All the tropes of a running series are found here. The royalty-free music placed near the end of the episode to make you reflect, the constant cliff hangers (which are archaic in the age of binge watching), and the excessive - and I mean EXCESSIVE - investment in character backstory and development. This last trope is particularly obnoxious.At least five episodes are dedicated to the development of characters or establishing their backstory. The growth of the characters are so slow, repetitive and saturating that it makes it hard to become invested in them. It is ironic that you feel more for the lesser characters than for the primary characters.Another point of contention are the games and where they take place. There is such a thing as inspiration, but there is also such a thing as theft. This show borrows inspiration from previous Battle Royale style works (see As the Gods Will it and Alice in Borderland). However, what it borrows in inspiration from one work, it blatantly steals from another. Those who have watched Battle Royale would be able to tell just how blatantly lifted one of its unique concepts is during one pivotal scene in the series. This is not excusable.What is also inexcusable are the actors who portrayed the VIPs. Calling the acting atrocious is a compliment. Their acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like an Oscar contender.The lukewarm observations of ethics, morality and the human condition would appeal to teenagers or forum philosophers, but to the seasoned viewers who have either watched Korean cinema or Battle Royale movies it is as run of the mill as it gets.,The film has an interesting and, of course, sensational story in a way that provokes humans to follow the series, which shows how human beings are willing to play even with their own lives like movies because of economic poverty. In the film, players have weaknesses that can be realized by looking closely at the film. The film is made in an attractive atmosphere and its writing group has acted strongly. In general, the film is fascinating and, of course, new, but one should not expect much from its acting ensemble, The film has an interesting and, of course, sensational story in a way that provokes humans to follow the series, which shows how human beings are willing to play even with their own lives like movies because of economic poverty.

In the whole film, it is fascinating and, of course, new, but one should not expect much from its acting ensemble.,Only a sociopath will like watching something like this. The show has very negative energy and it affects the audience. If you don\\'t realise that I\\'m sorry for you. I love thrillers and horror movies if they have a point in them. This is too much because there are literally so many people living in debt especially now during COVID and the suicide rates have skyrocketed because of it. This is not funny, nor interesting, nor enjoyable to watch!,Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP\\'s becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the \"twist\" ending was predictable as I\\'d thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I\\'m only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the \"intruder\" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.P. S. Would you play?,Fantastically haunting soundtrack.Rich character development that leads to you having a connection with all of the lead roles.Iconic costumes and a horrifying and thought provoking plot.This should would have gotten a 10 of if wasnt for episodes 7 and 9.(SPOILER ALERT)\\r\\nX - episode 7 - the VIP\\'s were absolutely horribly cast and they needed a stronger script. I completely understand what they were trying to achieve but literally every line that came out of any of their mouths was cringe worthy in delivery. It took away from an otherwise outstanding episode.X - episode 9 - Everyone loved the relationship of old mate and the lead character. The final ep really took away from that connection. I am a fan of twists but this one just didnt seem believable for me. The character was just too different to be credible.X - red hair was pointless\\r\\nX - Not getting on the plane felt like a stretch from the leads character. Lets just hope he doesnt go full John Wick in season 2 or its just too far from everything that was great in 7 of the 9 eps.Its hard to give above an 8 when the vips and old mate twist was just one cringe too far.,I came late into watching Squid Games since I knew I needed to have my head in the \"game\".First episode is a great introduction of the main character and how brutal the games are. But, even now brutal the games are portrait I had a worse feeling in my body watching episode 2 with the appropriate title \"Hell\".These first two episodes tell you more or less all you need to know about the main cast to establish a relationship with them and there own problems, creating a greater understanding.The show has a few side stories that I kinda didn\\'t care that much about and seems like padding more than anything else and didn\\'t really seem to pan out anything in the show.For the last episode I like it up until the last few minutes where I had a: \"Oh no! They are gonna make a season 2!?!\" and a few searches online affirmed my feelings. I don\\'t mind a new season, but I\\'d rather they rounded of this story and then just made a new one for season 2, but you know, gotta have them cliffhangers.Good show, a kinda unsatisfying end.,Could barely get through the first 30 mins of this. Extremely boring, cheesy, unstimulating,... I kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on... a lot of over acting. I do not understand what the hype is all about.,The people\\'s bar hit that low ? People who whatched real thrills they really think that is enjoyable!? Or it is all about the tik tok generation. The public tatste tendency is horrifying.,Watching Squid Game makes me think about a lesser known horror movie \"Would you Rather\". Same concept of people participating on a game for money and ends up all being dead except the main character who goes home with the money but with a dead loved one. Acting is pretty good, as well as the effects, but the plot was predictable right after they came back to the game. The MC\\'s actions feels unrealistic, suddenly making an enemy out of his friend after he actually just barely saved all of them at the stepping stones. He also didn\\'t do anything about his daughter who was the whole point of him joining the game. The police man intruder sub plot feels more like a filler since it doesn\\'t do anything about the actual plot, it could have been entirely erased from the story and won\\'t change anything about the outcome. Even the old man twist at the end doesn\\'t really do much about everything. Overall, still pretty watchable and a nice way to kill some time during Pandemic. Hopefully, if Season 2 does come, they could connect all those plot holes and make it work.,I was so hyped to watch this because everywhere I went, people were talking about it. My expectations were set high by the internet community, but the internet community often doesn\\'t know anything. This was mediocre, 6* show, but I\\'m giving it 2*, because of all the people that gave it 10*. I was so disappointed when it ended, because they never explained anything.,I just cannot grasp why people rate this over 5 points. Really. If it dosent take more than something like this to get great rating, the quality perception has really deteriorated during the pandemic.,The brand new hype series of the season. Is it any good? With so many commenting about it and the massive number of positive reviews on this website, I dare ask the question everybody feels so confronted when asked: why? If you have seen the show and enjoyed it, please take a minute to consider the reasons for that. I feel like \"Squid Game\" has been given too much credit, and I will try to explain why without spoiling for those who still consider watching it.A few users on IMDb have already pointed out many incongruities in the story, unresolved plot points, character inconsistencies, unexplained details and while all of it is valid criticism, I could easily nitpick any number of flaws with the story, dialogue and characters, and not make a point. Aside from the fact that I don\\'t want to spoil the series, I think it\\'s more important to highlight the general idea of the show and why most plot holes, from small to gigantic, were a problem, instead of just listing them.To begin with, the premise is preposterous and nobody would think that to be feasible, therefore it\\'s unreasonable to criticize the show for being unrealistic. We take what is given to us and suspend our disbelief until further notice. And that\\'s where the issues begin. I can happily ignore certain details about HOW all of it came to be, if those details are never mentioned again. However, \"Squid Game\" takes an approach to its story that confronts the whole idea of its premise, setting it against rational inquiry of the facts shown to us. Simply put, its an absurd story trying to be realistic. Is that a problem? Not necessarily. Take \"The Platform\" for example: The absurd premise is justified by the bigger picture, a metaphor. \"The Platform\" doesn\\'t dwell on the details of HOW it all came to be, or WHO is behind all of it. It doesn\\'t matter, because the narrative structure only serves as a parallel between our\\'s and the movie\\'s reality. Then how does \"The Platform\" differ from \"Squid Game\"? In favor of reliable (read: cliché) plot conflicts, the metaphor aspect comes crashing down in \"Squid Game\". For example, when the masked game enforcers are shown as human, it naturally begs the question: HOW did those people end up there? Now these characters are not an idea anymore, they are people, and people need stories. And guess what? They never get one.That problem repeats itself a number of times, most notably with the main characters\\' decisions, as they repeatedly take actions that are not in accordance with their already established characteristics. When they break character, it is in favor of a simple and predictable resolution to the problem faced. If they were to act accordingly to themselves, the story wouldn\\'t go the authors\\' way. That would create conflicts the writers wouldn\\'t know how to solve, therefore they end up relying on clichés to save themselves from that trouble.The way I see it, a story like this should have taken one of 3 approaches: realistic, fantastical or metaphorical.As a metaphor, \"Squid Game\" could\\'ve worked not unlike the aforementioned \"The Platform\", drawing parallels with the elements of the show and our reality.As a fantasy series, it could have gone down the same path as \"Alice in Borderland\". The realism wouldn\\'t matter then and the mystery would be stronger.As a realistic show we would have something like \"Saló or 120 days of Sodom\". And it should\\'ve felt just as disturbing, after all, both stories are about powerful people playing with the lives of unfortunate souls. But that doesn\\'t seem the point \"Squid Game\" wants to make, after all it puts us in the same place of the evil powerful men in masks: sitting comfortably in our sofas, relishing in the spectacle of violence, anguish and pain. But hey, that could be the point the show is making, right? You are just as bad as those evil men! You are enjoying this show too! But no, \"Squid Game\" doesn\\'t confront you with that notion, like Michael Haneke did with \"Funny Games\". You are to mindlessly enjoy the carnage and ask no further questions. Are you satisfied? Don\\'t worry about answering that. Keep yourself busy. Watch another episode before you have time to ask yourself another silly question.,Few TV shows episodes have had the same effect for me as Squid Game\\'s first episode, especially when the game starts, for real. Shocking, in every way. On par with GoT premiere and some 9th episodes.Another highlight is episode 6, Ggangu. It left me in tears, gasping for breath.And the finale wraps things up in an unexpected way. Bravo!I try to sum up some of the great stuff of the show:\\r\\nLovable main character - such a refreshing contrast to hollywood heroesGreat, multifaceted characters overall, whether they are bad or good.Characters don\\'t look like supermodels, but like average people. Well, except one, but she is phenomenal tooGreat acting, and overacting - but fun, and touchingColours, details - everything pops out in a 4k glory4k gory, did I say. It makes your stomach churn.Cinematics - beautifully shot, awesome visuals.Practical sets and special effects, which are fantastic.The clothes, masks, hoods - where can I buy those?Music. Haunting score, memorable tunes.Writing, plot, excitement.Cliffhanger endings on episodes.There are messages about the modern world, makes you think about humanityIts not a kids\\' show. But grown ups, go for it.,Squid game is not just about some kind of life and death game thriller. It is way way more than that. Unmasking human, and some masked people are doing this, the irony is too good and on point. Strong performances and fast paced script make it more intriguing. One of the finest K dramas ever. Eagerly waiting for season 2.,I was so intrigued to finally watch this and I managed to avoid spoilers. (Just a heads up this review and my opinions will contain spoilers so please steer clear if you want to avoid them yourself.)The whole concept of this series was pretty damn cool and very compelling. The sets, cinematography, music and character designs as well as their back stories were thought out and exceptionally done. Really amazing.The acting was all really good except for the VIPs... I was looking forward to meeting them so much; who they were and what their experience and involvement was but when they were introduced I feel that the series started to fall apart. There was an immersion that was broken upon their introductions and they didn\\'t really serve any purpose either.All of the games and the main content of this show were really well done but the final three episodes really lost me. I wasn\\'t as interested and the way it ended felt off to me. It wasn\\'t a good wrap up at all. This was disappointing because the first five episodes were really edge of your seat kind of viewing.,Interesting concept but I just don\\'t get why many of the (adult) characters in the Corean shows/movies I\\'ve seen act like one-dimensional, overdramatic, yelling twelve year olds? It makes it hard to take the story seriously and even more difficult to empathize with most of the characters.It\\'s a cultural thing I guess but It\\'s hard to get used to or appreciate.HoYeon Jung is an amazing actress though!,Gratuitous violence. And we wonder why the world is in the state it is in. Trivializing atrocity by juxtaposing callous murder with cheerful music. Sick.,Even though I have Netflix, I only watch when I see a trailer on a social media platform I use. What got me hooked was the simple fact when granny used her bank pin as her grand daughter\\'s birthday, I KNEW I HAD to watch. 6.8 baby here & plus I\\'m part Korean.,OK yes, the VIP acting was atrociously bad and at the end it got a bit predictable. But other than that this is a masterfully crafted drama by filmmakers who damn well know how to create tension and suspense. I was worried that the \"game\" would turn into a gimmick, but it works so so so well! The acting is also phenomenal, the main characters are portrayed so viscerally human and the \"game\" acts to enrich these characters while making us feel all the thrills! Its damn great stuff!TL;DR: Incredible film making, suspense, tension, great characters and horrible VIP\\'sLooking forward to Season 2 (if there is one :) !!,The story is far from original. You have seen it all back in Battle Royale, Hunger Games and maybe dozens of other kill to survive genre movies. However, this one has Korean Cinema stylishness, great cinematography, good directing and acting. Story and characters lack logic most of the time so just enjoy the colorful and gore world of Squid Game. Do not expect flawless story or deep social messages or grand philosophy because there is none.,My goodness...this show brilliantly took me down a path of horrors. Each episode digging deeper into terrible situations. And just when you think things can\\'t get much worse, they do. But I loved nearly every second of it. Warning: One of the episodes definitely gave my girlfriend an anxiety attack.,This is the proof people are still fans of predictable stories. If this is the 2021 most mainstream TV series, something is definitely off. Except for a few moments and interesting parts when they participate in the game, everything else is filled with already seen stuff. Main character\\'s morality is selectable/clashing in different situations, ridiculous plot twists and most of all, acting and dialogue of \"rich people watching\" is major cringe. I would avoid this, except if you really want to see why is this so popular.,Could not relate to the story or any of the characters. Just didn\\'t even care who lives, who dies. Loopholes in the story galore. Unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. In the end was like *yawn* whatever. No issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. This felt like it is riding on the wave movies like Parasite created for Korean cinema/TV. Bloated overhyped nonsense at best. Give it a skip and save your time.,I have to agree that the VIPs are the weakest point to the show, but they hardly ruin it. Don\\'t let the criticism towards them stop you from watching what may be the best miniseries I\\'ve ever seen.I look forward to watching this again.,Honestly wow - from the first episode I sat wide mouthed, what am I watching and why - I didn\\'t care.This series is amazing, it\\'s brutal, it made me cry - what a watch.Suddenly you don\\'t care about the subtitles, they pale into nothing, they don\\'t matter - you find yourself watching this, reading effortlessly.An amazing series, thank you!,I knew this will be amazing on first look of it, I watched it as soon as it got out on netflix, it is briliant and it deseves all love that is getting.,Which I guess includes me; after all, I did watch all 8 1/2 episodes with no one exactly aiming a gun at my head. But I did fast-forward through the most ridiculous parts, so.Tragically enough, I sense a degree of genius involvement somewhere along the line, probably at the very start of the Squid project. A writer with a vision and actual talent, ordered by some meathead producer to make the whole thing as vile and watchable as, say, the first instalment of Saw, and the writer (whom in this case, also got to direct it) did it so his or her family could eat. Or at least that\\'s the take I can live with. But anyway: don\\'t even get me started on the way Netflix treats their talent. I imagine their top execs are just like those revolting VIPs, more than capable of watching people die for fun.Such a shame that this Netflix fodder will be remembered as the Korean finest, while the real good - not Netflix - stuff, like Kingdom and Train to Busan, will most likely get buried under a relentless pile of total squid.,This show was incredible. Cinematography and script. -2 points because of the incredibly unlikeable, mostly pathetic main actor that is all in all acted like a terrible person to his family but not to everyone else. I didn\\'t understand his motivation sometimes and he got quite annoying. The acting of the VIPs was a bit bizarre too.,I don\\'t really understand the point of the cop subplot... Otherwise I had a blast watching this show, loved the cinematography, and the main actor is great.,Let me begin by saying if you\\'re squimish about blood and guts, do not watch this series. There\\'s a good story line to follow but I found it a bit excessive when it came to blood but being a horror fan, I was able to deal with this part of the series. On the whole, the series is a study in human behavior especially under critical conditions and I\\'m sure this show will be a required study in all psychology classes. IMO, I feel as though the writers were paying homage to Stanley Kubrick and his portfolio of work. See if you can see the similarities as you get deeper into the story line. There are 9 episodes which last about an hour and one that\\'s about 30 minutes long. There\\'s been much talk about it on social media and that\\'s given it a boost in viewership but all in all it kept my attention enough to see how it was going to end. I gave it an 8 since it drew me into watching the whole series....,This is a masterful blend of elements of fantasy, psychological thriller, character development, personal journal- a refreshing example of superbly crafted storyline\\'s. At last!! A decent , fresh program on Netflix!This Korean series is addictive, superbly cast, cleverly directed & beautifully production designed. The editing is gripping.The sound effects are nail biting. We loved it.5 stars to all the lead actors.Cannot wait for the series 2.But please, please, please- don\\'t extend forever into series 6,7, 8...etc, etc, like some of the other substandard Hollywood shows that Netflix has commissioned before.,There is a lot of gore, of course, and you will definitely cry at some point of the show, probably twice at least. Still, it\\'s a fantastic show that I highly recommend watching (not with the English dub though, because it sounds very goofy).,The concept of the show is very unique and it was really interesting. But the show was really slow paced. So, if you don\\'t have the patience you might even quit. Acting was good except the few VIPs whose acting were horrible. The show makes you emotional towards various characters.,Games with deaths, friendships, betrayal- we\\'re not new with these stories. The idea of the story is interesting, but not interesting enough to make all these hypes about it. A very overrated and over-hyped show.,Scenario is okey,actings is okey and offcourse big budget netflix serie but deserves max to be 7 point who watches real good tv series fans. Just okey and nothing special and the worst part mostly when you watch netflix production you see only production in series not orijinal something.again exaggerated one more serie like la casa della papel.,Superb series mind-blowing suspense thriller novel drama all mixed.,It starts very weird as the concept is quite abstract, the violence is sudden and spectacular and some of the acting is very OTT. However, the story is intriguing enough to keep you going and around the middle of the series it really finds its stride. One particular episode is truly heartbreaking and superbly well-shot and acted. Unfortunately, in a needless desire to force a \\'shocking twist\\' into the ending, they up completely undermining that best episode in the show. It really left a sour taste at the end before the final episode just drifts on a bit and ends without much more happening.Overall, glad I watched it but felt the last episode was a enormous let-down.,I don\\'t understand the hype surrounding this show.I found the story to be quite slow and boring, mainly when they aren\\'t competing. Do the games catch your attention? Sure. But it isn\\'t anything to write home about.,The games and story is a crazy one. Surprised they pulled this off during covid but of course it\\'s korean drama. They are at the top of their game. Very gorey, heads up.,I\\'ll give this series a high 6. A lot of clichés and familiar tropes collide here. I would definitely watch another series if it were offered though, as there are many avenues for this to go. If you\\'re young, or don\\'t watch a lot of movies/series, the hype is for you. Enjoy.,Best thing I\\'ve seen on Netflix in months. The way that the games are set up is what makes this good. I just would rather be shot in the head instead of playing this....\\r\\nTug of War and that Glass game is brutal! Almost cried during the Marble game. And the two most irritating players plunged to their death at the same time. I was on my couch cheering!Check it out.,Im soo glad i watched this before all the hype started because shows are always ruined by hype and spoilers. Being completely new to korean telly, i was shockingly surprised by the story line, the drama, the acting, the cinematics and the entire shabang! Its the best series i have seen in a very very long time but i do feel it will be a one hit wonder. A season 2 just wont be able to match up to the buzz & excitement surrounding Season 1.,U got to give it to the Koreans. They know what art is and how to present it. I was hooked from beginning to end. A quite original production with lots of memorable scenes that we will remember for years to come. I cant give 10 stars because i disagree with the ending, but that doesnt change the fact that i stepped on a diamond.,Great show with surprising end but with the fear of a second, everything destroying second season due to the open last part of the show.,This show drags. I beg of you to skip episode two altogether.We\\'re here to watch the people play the games and die. I don\\'t care about all of these absolute whiny little girls and their annoying problems.I\\'ll admit, I\\'m watching with English dubs. It\\'s just like anime. It sounds over-acted and annoying. All the women in this show sounds beyond annoying.This show shines when it focuses on the games and the storytelling slightly before and after the games. Everything else is drawn out. I wonder if it\\'s because it\\'s a tv show. A movie would have gotten all of this out of the way and then play ball!There are some great diamonds hidden under an abundance of rocks. If you can hold out, then you can enjoy some great scenes. If you have zero patience though, do yourself a favour and hope they make a movie version.,This Is Wonderful and Best Webseries Forever. It has Also Season 2. It is available on all Languages. This Type of webseries Never before Ever after. It has Mind Blocking Twists.,I truly enjoyed this show from the beginning but eventually less and less when people started comparing it to some of the greats.Squid Game is meaningful and has a strong message against capitalism but what people fail to see somehow its a rip off of Alice in borderland..In a nutshell, You will enjoy watching this but don\\'t let the hype get to you.,I\\'ve just finished watching this and I still need to process what is just went through. This show is very different than anything on TV these days.The script is very extreme and the story makes you think how would you act in such situations.I loved the characters.,Loved this series and how it kept me hooked until the very end. The very last game and conclusion were rather mediocre and was a cheap method at opening up the doors to a Season 2, but everything up until that point were a clear 9/10.If you love competitive death game/escape room movies/shows, this is one you should not pass on.,First of all, I only saw one episode, and only because this series is now all the rage, apparantly. I don\\'t see the appeal.Right off the bat, I felt the protagonist was very tropy and annoying. Why was it necessary to depict him as a pathological gambler? Not a lot of people can relate to that, but almost everyone knows what it\\'s like to be broke (which is what drove him to enter the game, so he wouldn\\'t lose his daughter). Why doesn\\'t the show have the courage to write typical people? I\\'ll tell you why: It\\'s just not smart enough to do it.Twenty years ago, this show might have had something interesting to say. Today, it\\'s just par for the course. We live in the Squid Games. There are poor people right now somewhere who are in the actual Squid Games. If you don\\'t have a gun to your face, you are somewhere else on the Squid Games spectrum, which goes all the way to the other extreme, where losing means hearing the words: \"you\\'re fired\".If you want to say something about the reality of poor people, it better be important. This series is clearly just gory entertainment. In Hollywood, there is greater awareness today that white authors can inadvertently create black stereotypes that don\\'t age well. The same awareness doesn\\'t exist when rich people fictionalize poor people for the exploitation of poor people. It\\'s actually quite gross.Have dignity, don\\'t watch this junk.,Ok so I was having a difficult time remembering their on screen names as well as real names apart from Ali(Played by Anupam Tripathi).What made me watch this is ofcourse the way it topped the Netflix most viewed content chart and to be real it was indeed an experience for me.In the initial episode I remembered the characters like \"ok the North Korean girl\", \"Ok the lead actor\", \"Ok the bad guy and his gang \" etc etc.For me it is definitely an edge of the seat thriller as I almost binged it in two days.What me yawn was the final episode which probably laid foundation for the second season.I go with 9/10 here for the performances, the writing and the apt direction.The games have you in the moment where you probably forget you were breathing too.Go for it.,The concept carries the film. It\\'s really interesting, but unfortunately the player interactions are sooo cliche and corny. They\\'re like the last seasons of the Walking Dead, for those that have seen them. The ending game especially was just so bad. They tried to establish ambiguity about the main character\\'s ethos in the first episode, but it all goes out the window and he becomes just 100% angelic good guy, which is frustrating and annoying to watch.I still enjoyed it, I suppose, but with each episode I liked it less and less. It\\'s fine to entertain yourself for a week but it isn\\'t something to come back to.,I enjoyed the show up until the ending, I knew the premise of it before beginning it, its a hunger games and survival show. I wanted to know the why of it, it\\'s the reason I decided to watch. I found it a bit violent, but it had great visuals, very colorful and actors where not bad either, I actually empathized with main characters and enjoyed the side stories. However, the ending was terrible, I was expecting much much more, on the investigative side the detective does very little and I was dissapointed that he actually gets killed without mercy and further by the front man, who is his brother, and his side of the story is never told. I agree that would make a good second season material, however, the last scenes where the old man reveals he created the game with his buddies for entertainement purposes, and to relieve boredom with no further purpose, is killing all the mystery and there would absolutely be nothing new for the second season in terms of mystery, just need for revenge. The old man, instead of using his money to do good, he created and apparently participated in children\\'s games, where he bets with his rich buddies and kills the poor men and women who are indebted and obviously need help. Rich people killing poor people just for entertainment, I find it disgusting and without substance. Overrated show and terrible ending. That ending spoiled the second season for me.,Wow so exiting and good! Loved it so much! Highly recommend it you wont regret it.,First off, this show is worth a watch, despite my rating for it. It is entertaining and gets you hooked (though it definitely won\\'t get you hanging on the edge of your seat). The problem is: the plot is weak, riddled with clichés, and full of plot holes.There is no such thing as a surprising plot twist in this show. After the first couple of episodes, you already know exactly what is going to happen. As I said, it is okay to watch when you have nothing else to see, but, in my honest opinion, it is super undeserving of its 8+ rating and not at all worth all the hype.Here\\'s a small, very limited, list of a few issues I found with it. (ATTENTION: SPOILERS):\\r\\nWhat are the odds that, in a group of 201 people, they would make a vote and that vote would be split exactly in half, with the last one to vote being the tie-breaker? Seriously, I think that the odds of that vote ending 101 to 100 are less likely than the odds of a show like that existing in real life.They talk a big game about how they strive to provide a space that is equal for everyone, and are even apologetic when something doesn\\'t go according to that rule. Well, sorry to say, but if you allow the very OWNER of the criminal organization play the games and not suffer any consequences when he loses, then you are absolutely NOT providing a fair and leveled playing field for everyone. Also, the dude with the tattoo got MULTIPLE benefits throughout the show. Here are a few:1. When someone threatened to kill another player, they would instantly face the threat of being killed themselves by the show staff. However, when tattoo dude kills someone in front of the staff, he suffers no consequence whatsoever.2. Tattoo guy agreed to play the marbles game one way. However, when he started to lose, he cried foul to the staff and they actually allowed him to change the game (seriously, that was ridiculous plot armor for him)\\r\\n3. Whenever someone refused to play a game, they would instantly face the consequences, as people needed to keep playing to provide the VIPs with more entertaining value in the finale. When tattoo dude refuses to play on the glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens to him. Seriously?Anyways, back to the regular stuff:\\r\\nThe plot, as I previously mentioned, is constantly obvious and easy to guess. Everyone knew the smart dude would become a villain, everyone knew that the lady that didn\\'t find a partner for that marble contest would be left alive, and everyone knew that tattoo dude was not going to lose that marble game because he just had the most incredible, unbreakable plot armor in history. It was also obvious as heck that the competition that was in pairs was going to make one character play against the other. And they acted like all of those were like huge plot twists. Do you think your audience is that stupid?There is no real tension that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout the show because the main characters are the only ones that are thoroughly explored, and you either love them or hate them. No matter what happens, you ALWAYS know that the team in which the protagonist is on is going to win, and you can always figure out who is going to win or lose in all contests. In the marble contest, again, they had MULTIPLE opportunities to actually introduce a valuable plot twist, but no. Face tattoo dude lives, protagonist lives, smart guy lives, north korean girl lives, crazy lady lives. You can just see the producers were desperate to keep these characters on because they, themselves didn\\'t have enough faith in their work to think that it would be able to sustain itself after killing off a main character.Another RIDICULOUS plot device was the body of the guard that the police officer killed washing up exactly on the island were they were holding the games, when he threw the body off of the boat in THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. That scene was completely unnecessary and broke my immersion on the show even more.Are you telling me that Ali, a guy who came all the way from Pakistan to live in South Korea ACTUALLY managed to learn how to speak Korean, one of the most difficult languages for non-native speakers, flawlessly and perfectly, but didn\\'t know what even or odd numbers were? REALLY? SERIOUSLY?And then there is the ending. So, this show is going to tell me that that stupid main character, who did absolutely nothing throughout the show, didn\\'t even manage to win it by himself, is now going to take on a whole criminal organization that even has its own island? The dude is going to go from a jackass who can\\'t even wipe his own butt and lives off of his mother\\'s money in his 30s to a John Wick type of guy who can destroy anything he touches? What a terrible ending to a severely underwhelming show.There are many more ridiculous plot holes to be talked about, those are just some of the highlights. However, since this review is already long enough, I\\'m going to leave it here.Very mediocre show. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to see, but do not believe the hype. 6/10 (being very generous).,I kept seeing it #1 on Netflix so decided to give it a try. It was slow paced but interesting. I was bored at times. There are much better Korean shows and movies so not sure how this one caught on and became so popular. Overall it was fine.,Endings are hard for even the best writers and nowhere is that clearer than in season 1 of Squid Game.After what amounted to one of the year\\'s most powerful, poignant, and emotional seasons of television, Squid Game falls flat on it\\'s face with one of the worst season finales in recent memory.At the core of this unfortunate misstep is an apparent desire to insert a twist where none was needed, and the worst kind of twist at that, the kind that devalues the emotional weight of the entire story.Squid Game is still a fantastic journey and would easily be a solid 9 or 10/10, just maybe skip the final episode.,I just loved it! You can easy watch it during all weekend non stop! It\\'s so much different from other series available. Completely different genre.Recommended to everyone.,The idea is phenomonal, to create some fun for those who have every social and material satisfation within normal human societies and to offer an opportunity for those who are nothing and have nothing within normal human societies. Inspiring extreme setting, but we should be careful that it cannot represent the whole society.,This series is one you have to stick through, I did want to turn it off because it took a while to get to the point, but I\\'m glad I didn\\'t. Only thing I was not a fan of was the VIPs, they\\'re very unnecessary and could have been left out. Other than that, it is put well together and detailed. I enjoyed it.,I\\'m just gonna say this right off the bat, Ali deserves better. Period. That scene where Sangwoo betrayed him got me clutching my pearls and choking on air. I\\'ve never been one to watch K-series, and this series got me hooked! The acting is exceptional for all Korean characters EXCEPT the VIPs. What in the name of Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers was going on with their horrendous, cold, bleak acting?Aside from that, I appreciate how realistic and simple the plot is, but it is so well-developed. The one fact that hits hardest for me is the fact that if this game was to take place tomorrow, people would actually partake in it. Even more so, the same betrayals and back stabbing would happen too. Something chilling about that fact to me.,What I loved most about this show is the acting was fantastic (with the exception of the white VIPs - they were terrible actors - perhaps on purpose), the backstories were believable and heart wrenching, and the suspense was very real. This wasn\\'t violence for the sake of violence. I found myself rooting for certain characters and I was invested in the storytelling. The ending also didn\\'t disappoint. One of the best Netflix shows I\\'ve seen. Very much looking forward to season 2. Also, viewing tip: don\\'t watch with English voices dubbed over. Do the subtitles. It feels more real and genuine. You really get a sense of emotion in the voices.,Every time I started watching this I could not get into it. Today I decided to give it a try and I was completely hooked. The story was really good and I Watched the whole season in 2 days. There were some potholes, so I\\'m a little confused about Certain things but, overall it was really well done. Looking forward to another season.,It keeps you excited from the start, the end was stretched could have been better.Beautiful concept Loved it !!This shows the new concept can work.,This series is exceptional. It poses a narrative which delves into the human psyche. Themes of duality, choice, power and control are played out within the game. The series is analysing socio-political, gender and class binaries within stunning scenography, beautiful symbology and a compelling story line.I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Battle Royale, or Asian Tartan Extreme films.,Extremely enjoyable. I believe it deserves its high rating. It invokes a lot of emotion and keeps you wanting more. Many life lessons to be learnt especially about trust. It reminds me if why the saying money is the root of all evil, and we see how betrayal even in the most unlikely people is caused by money and its possibilities to solved our life\\'s financial difficulties.... A must watch. Korean thrillers and horrors are truly enjoyable.,It was such an amazing show! I binge watched it and I hope they have a season 2. You sympathize with all the characters and you stay on the edge of your seat on every episode, and the performance of the actors that was amazing!,I\\'m kind of blown away by this masterpiece. It does has it\\'s flaws, mainly in the dubbing / subtitle area, but that\\'s pretty common with asian movies. I guess it\\'s next to impossible to do this 100% right. The series has awesome characters, not a single weak filler episode and many wtf moments. It\\'s a fresh breeze in the world of Netflix\\' teenie action series that are basically unwatchable as soon as you are older than 25.,Copy cat from Arena (2011)The story is senseless, i liked the authenticity in the Korean environment, more like a documentary for me than \\'entertainment\\' because the sequence of events is just not plausible nor logical.,And all of this about some paper??? (and I\\'m not talking about the deforestation...or am I?)I mean..there\\'s nothing human left in humanity, isn\\'t it? We all know the answer but it\\'s still deeply disturbing and saddening.Well, they tried to give us hope and even though there\\'s no reason to, I\\'m not ready to give up on that...yet.The fact that I cried for that old guy; what more can I say?!FUN?! WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN???I remembered smth from \"Crash\" which fits perfectly here\"It\\'s the sense of touch. (...) We\\'re always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something.\"And there\\'s that about social classes, hierarchy, capitalism, religion, nature vs. Nurture, immigration, suicide, love, blah-blahThe show is brilliant!,It was a colourful as a ROMCOM. Guess for movies like this the color tone should be as it\\'s in SAW.Didn\\'t feel connected to any character.Hundreds dying, blood sprouting from bodies but yet no thrill.Last 3 episodes were just dragged, had to forward scenes just to finish this series.,You play, you will die or win, it\\'s easy.The main idea (( A match that everyone needs to survive from a life and death game)) is an old idea, but it still has a great potential for making great movies and series like this.I really enjoyed it when I was watching it. The actors played great, the music is stressful and great too, the main story and games are carefully selected.In my opinion everyone can watch this series and enjoy it, not for searching for little mistakes.,Everything works for me. The concept, the acting, the twist, the tone, the plot, everything.Superb.,The whole series is tense in every game, as if you were playing for real there hahaha (if you get spoilers, it feels different). BUT ONLY ONE, EWW FOREIGNER VIP GUEST... THEIR ACT LIKE TRASH, SOO CRINGE. But it doesn\\'t reduce the tension tho, hihihi. And in Korean dramas, there are always scenes that make you cry... prepare your tissues.,I just finished watching this series and just loved it. I thought it was a series that would somehow disappoint me but as soon as I started watching it I couldn\\'t stop.I liked the fact that it was a few episodes and that it didn\\'t overly stretch the storyline. The colors, the scenography, the music and every single detail has become iconic.I found the acting of the various characters very beautiful.The series has managed to adapt to a more Western context, managing to make space around the world.,Very well written and new concept with little flaws or missing scripts. But overally a very good show. The only thing I found that it\\'s very slow.Shows every aspect of humans in a good fictional ways how each one betrays or kills or uses others for own survival. And the last episode where he tells how you bet on horses we on humans, shows the power of hierarchy. A very well written story as always I\\'ve seen other works of the director and he never disappoints badly.,I want to dedicate this review just for episode 6 which involves a marble game.Episode 6 is the greatest piece of emotional rollercoaster i have ever watched. This episode is depressing, shocking, tender, furious, helpless, funny, intelligent and cunning. Unbelievably good and sick!Just this episode alone deserves an award for the team.Overall, it\\'s a great series even though personally i didn\\'t like the last 2 episodes.,The core idea of the games are interesting, but the terrible writing, terrible story and terrible acting make it really tough to finish. Additionally, beyond the first game, and maybe parts of the second the games themselves are boring and usually a slog to get through. But don\\'t worry if you missed anything in the show, there will be nine different actors monologuing exposition.recalling what ou just watched seconds before, and even that will most likely be followed by an extremely unnecessary flashback. It\\'s all just so so heavy handed, and this entire series honestly should have just been a 90 minute movie. Look there\\'s some good in there, and I\\'m not dismissing it entirely as trash, but man, even the ending is terrible in 3-4 different ways. So look, if you want to see what everyone was talking about l, turn your brain all the way off, get your phone or laptop to do something enjoyable and put it on in the background. BUT, if you value your time, find some recaps online or some YouTube videos breaking it down and call it a day. I promise you that you\\'re not kissing anything life hanging or profound - it\\'s a simple show made for background viewing at an airport bar at best.,In this amazing documentary The World Economic Forum and it\\'s sociopath members have lured \"Climate Change\" deniers and \"vaccine\" hesitant people into a deadly game of life and death. Will the people wake up and unite or are we all doomed to a future under the boot of the worst people on the planet...,Really enjoyed the series. Probably would have given it a 9...that ending though.,The survival game trope isn\\'t usually my thing, but this one was actually done really well. The characters are complex with backstory so it\\'s not just all about the games.I agree with everyone else about the VIPs. Prepare yourself for them and try to pretend they didn\\'t happen. I can\\'t wait for the day kdramas stop sticking random English speakers into their shows. They\\'re always the worst actors and no matter how good the show and the Korean actors are, the English speakers always instantly make the scene cheesy and look and act like a fish out of water.To be fair I have spoken to a Korean friend who told me that due to the language barrier this awkward delivery isn\\'t picked up on in Korea. But just a warning, the English speaking scenes in this show were the most cringy I\\'ve seen in any kdrama, both acting wise and writing too for some reason. The rest of the show was great.Otherwise, highly recommended. I loved the last episode, and it seems they left room for a possible season 2.,I gave somehow high rating because this TV show brings something new/fresh. But I cannot say that I \"like\" it. No, I don\\'t like it. It\\'s boring in the beginning, then there\\'s some highlights when games begin, and slowly it goes \"the wrong direction\". Often it\\'s not convincing, not clear, and sometimes doesn\\'t make much sense. I will not spoil here. Worth watching? I guess yes (if nothing better available), but I don\\'t really look forward to the second season that I surely expect to come.,Therefore I vote it in the gutter, because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it.,I know that as one ages one turns into a grumpy old flatulating individual passing plenty of not just faeces but righteous judgement on a collapsing morally bankrupt world. All said, this \\'review\\' comes from a person who saw Lord of The Flies when about 14 after our superb English teacher felt it worth seeing after we read the book as part of our education. I found both the book and movie so traumatic they changed my life. But probably in a good way. The point being made that below a certain age or level of training, young people are not suited to positions of power or leadership. More recently, productions and video games based on the Battle Royale principle also alert us as to the ethics of exploiting vulnerable young people for the schadenfreude entertainment of adults and a baying public. Sadly, The Hunger Games put production spectacle and creepy puppeteers ahead of violence, so the point wasn\\'t really made, but it has the benefit of warning a younger audience how some adults use them.*** SPOILER ALERT ***\\r\\nI had never heard of Squid Game and happened to catch it on Netflix last night where I saw the first episode. What got me was now just how there was NO humor in it at all, common with today\\'s productions, but the pure blood spurting realistic brutality of the scene where the giant \\'little\\' girl guns down those who are caught moving.As per The Hunger Games, the aesthetics and production design is superb, but can someone explain to me WHY such content is produced in the first place? Is Squid Game entertainment or a warning? And why is it a 15, not an 18? Alien was never gratuitously violent (they were at war) yet an 18 or X when released in the 70s. I know, I saw it when 15 and was terrified!My rating is based on the ethics of SG being a 15, not the quality of the production,,Very new and interesting story, talented cast. This Show makes you think about debt and suffering, and about what people are ready to do in order to get money. In spite of 2 episodes are not good enough, Show deserves good reviews.,The Hunger Games meets Pat Sharps Fun House. Loved it and made me think about all those childhood games I played. As with most films that have been dubbed some of the characters are on the eccentric side, but that\\'s something you have to expect.,Meh.Update when I finish but so far nothing really stands out for me or remotely exciting. Y\\'all are insane for this. What\\'s all the racket about????,I\\'m sure by this time most of you have seen this series and I\\'m glad to have watched it as well the minute it came out in Netflix. For those who haven\\'t, there are a lot of memes and clips showcased in FB and Tiktok..and in all honesty watching this is an absolute treat.We are all aware by now how Koreans can leave us in awe when it comes to the series or movies that they create. And Squid Game is an interesting and unique concept, something that left me fascinated until the end. Some may think that it is just a series with gruesome games involved, but frankly that is the part which makes it exciting like hell.Short but sweet as it only contained 9 episodes, and although the ending will keep us curious and wanting for more, it\\'s enough for me to understand the plot and message it meant to deliver.Would you want a Season 2? I know I would.,A powerful series, a powerful message. Amazing experience.,This film is great, it deserves to be a phenomenal film this year. Apart from Squid games, there are many other survival games genre films, but what distinguishes Squid Game from other films of the same genre is that it departs from the real reality of human life. People in debt look for all kinds of ways to pay off their debts, even if they risk their lives. Meanwhile, among the rich, the struggle of the poor becomes entertainment for those who are tired of a life that is always fulfilled. This reality is sad, but this is what actually happened.In the end, when the 456th player has won the first prize and the billions of prizes, he does not find happiness because he has sacrificed the lives of his friends. Money becomes meaningless and his life is not like it used to be.,This film is amazing, deserves to be a phenomenal film this year. The selected players can portray the characters well, especially Kang Sae Byeok. There are many other films with the theme of survival games, but what distinguishes squid games from others is that it departs from the issue of social reality in society. Squid game provides a heart-wrenching reality that humans who are in huge debt are willing to do anything, including selling their lives for a deadly game. As for the conglomerate people who are tired of having got everything they want in life, they see the hardships of the poor as entertainment. In the end, the winner of this game realizes that winning money by killing others is not something fun, so the 456 billion is meaningless. This is what I think makes the Squid game very popular.,Battle Royale made the path so I can\\'t give the 10 stars because that movie paved the way for this show.If you don\\'t like thrillers sparkled with a bit of gore, you\\'d better pass, otherwise you\\'re in for a great ride.It is very dark, the character development is well made. In 9 episodes you get attached to them.Don\\'t listen to the people discussing the violence, you see worse in Hollywood but without the psychological scenario.There were plenty left for explanation but not in a frustrating way. More of I let the viewer decide. Great addition to the Netflic catalog allover.,It\\'s an amazing take on a really dark side of entertainment and games.,Top everything, go watch it, no seriously, this show was it for me.10/10.,One of the best series i have every watched! It gives you suspense, drama and exciting moments. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. The characters are well established, the performances are exceptional. Please do watch it!,Wasn\\'t planning on watching this series but all my friends and colleagues have been talking about it and I wanted to be able to discuss it with them, given the hype.It was alright, not worth the hype honestly.1st off, the costumes are a complete rip-off of Money Heist. 2nd, the story is basically the hunger games but in Korean. Thirdly, the ending wasn\\'t good. Lots of things didn\\'t add up and loose ends left.I actually lost interest around the 7th or 8th episode but stuck with it to see what happened. Not much, is the answer.If you want a better foreign series to tuck into I suggest \\'The Chestnut Man\\'.,Squid Game is one of those films/series that sticks with you days and weeks after you watch it. It\\'s hard to put your finger on exactly why because at face value it\\'s a really bloody gore fest. I have a very low tolerance for violence and gore but somehow this isn\\'t about that. It\\'s a study of human nature; a tale of haves and have nots, oppression, luck, desperation, love, friendship, greed and hope. Korean film is so rich in story telling it\\'s simply refreshing. This is an exceptional work of art. I loved so many things about it but the main character and the old man and the successful pride of the neighborhood are spectacular in every nuanced scene. I think what makes Squid Game so great is that we recognize these people either in ourselves or in those around us. We cheer for them, hate them, understand them. Don\\'t miss this film. Watch it with subtitles and let the native Korean language lead and watch it in doses. Binging is a LOT to handle in this one.,While this is somehow entertaining, yet there are a lot of boring moments, especially, as stated in other reviews, the terrible acting by half of the total cast.This show suffers of the repetitive design of many aspects, such as the costume, music, places, even the reaction of the actors.Also, there is always a boring moment between the games, and that\\'s while the games it self are not epic nor serious but some how they finish it with lots of blood and death...,The premise of this story is not unique, although the setting up of the games to the death in the form of well-know children\\'s games is unique. The first, second and third episodes were interesting and worth watching, but I feel you if you skipped to the last episode after that you wouldn\\'t have missed much.The conclusion of this series is clearly made with an eye on a second season, which is regrettable as it would have given a much stronger ending to the story line if there was finality on the outcome of the lives of all involved.In summary, I can understand why the show is so popular, but in essence it\\'s an old recipe being revisited and recycled for a new audience.,The games ar nothing but a real life projection, \"a democracy\" based on rules made by capitalism, no one takes it seriously until you need money... you work with no limits and you never find happiness... try to look different into this movie and you will find the true message, true about rules in society, about democracy, and how people change themselves how money can change someone, overall great story, great idea.,I initially gave this a 9/10... then it was mid way through my 2nd rewatch of the show when it clicked... I almost NEVER rewatch any show, and this is the first time I\\'ve ever watched a live action foreign show. That\\'s what clicked and made me give it 10/10.In such a short span of time, you get an emotional connection to the characters despite not even speaking the same language. The show has it\\'s flaws, but by far one of the best shows I\\'ve ever seen.,Despite how predictable was the plot, I watched it in two days. Well done!BTW, wtf with those VIP characters at the end, they were obnoxiously cringe. Bad acting or they made them on purpose?,Maybe the main dude wasn\\'t just so dumb and annoying, half the characters are hard to stand.,I tried, I really did. After reading so many positive reviews on the series, I gave it a try. Not just once...Overacting, seen mostly in Chinese kung-fu flicks, hit me after 15 minutes. So I quit. But not quite, since my kids loved the show, and I gave it another try, watching complete 1st episode and half of the 2nd one. That\\'s when I could not stand it any longer. The plot is quite predictable, the actors make stupid faces and a lot of unnecessary noise and movements. It just got plain silly and boring. Seen this story somewhere, or read some books with similar plots, I do not really remember. The point is: this crap of a series pretends to deliver some kind of message on greed, and people in need doing things they normally would never do... But it simply does not deliver, at least not to me. Been there, seen this somewhere.,I normally don\\'t view movies like these. I did enjoy and binge most of it until I got tired. The games and rules are original and fresh. There is lots of blood, gore and betrayal but this is expected considering the games are life and death. My only complaint was there was too much talking, a lot of could have been shortened-those I fast forwarded. I gave this 7 stars.,If you\\'re a person who shys away from international cinema because you\\'re not keen on subtitles or cultural barriers - this one is for you. Squid Game is so engaging, entertaining, and so well done that you forget entirely that you are watching a film in another language, from a different culture. I loved every episode and can\\'t wait for season 2!,I understand its success, and I see that Netflix knows how to catch with a series (especially with such a remarkable visual production). But on a personal level, I did not enjoy it, I saw it complete just because it is entertaining, but just. It seems to me that the only way to enjoy it would be to ignore the multiple script holes and inconsistencies in the plot, or to appreciate only the technical-visual section.,Squid games is amazing! From the first episode to the last, the tv series had my attention! Can\\'t wait for season 2.Explores human psychology really well!,This is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games. Don\\'t want just waste of time.,The first episodes were definitely hooking and story and characters were well built and interesting. But the second half got really boring and predictable. Full of of really stupid situations, non-logical story telling and absolute non-sense actions of many characters which kind of ruined it. Also, the open ending for second season...? Just finished it because...But many times, I was just in mood to turn it off...,Alright so tiktok influenced me to watch this and everyone was saying it was the best ever and it was good but way to overhyped, everyone was treating it like the second coming of Christ.,I really dont know where the hype comes from. To me its aight, but not like wooowwww!!A lot of mistakes throughout the whole show, makes it unbelievable and sometimes pretty boring. It was okay to watch but not in a matter of you really should watch this show.,The three things that I look for when watching something are storytelling, performance, and attention to detail. Squid game passes all of those with flying colors. The storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. Going into this, I thought that a show about deadly children\\'s games would get cheesy at points, but boy was I wrong. This show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. There isn\\'t much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the VIP\\'s that spoke English) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional Rollercoaster. Lastly, I\\'m the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. I can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because I didn\\'t catch a single inconsistency. It seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.This show is brutal, bleak, and doesn\\'t sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche\\'s. It feels authentic from start to finish. Definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch.,First of all, this review will contain heavy spoilers from the get go so stop reading if you haven\\'t watched the show.Let\\'s begin wtih a simple question. Can it all be justified? I am not trying to defend psychotic violence and sadism as well depravity of a satanist-looking cult full of rich boys billionaires but...As the old man finally said the obvious: They did it all on their own volition. They knowingly signed the rules. THEY chose to abide by it.. Further they could put an end to it anytime they wanted with majority voting.Also let us isolate one incident. The pancake game. If we set aside the GI Joe soldiers who - mind you- were always cordial, polite and abided by the rules such as to eliminate those who reveal face or take out the literal trash who chose to break the rules in their little hooligan clique of organ harvest... It remains to a fine testament that a self-declared \\'dimwit\\' loser who lives with his Mother can achieve the impossible - ie solving the umbrella puzzle with a literal gun pointed to his head. It\\'s almost Campbellesque hero\\'s epic and akin to a rite-of-passage transformation of handling a hot iron rod.So despite the psychotic riot mayhem and meaningless killing from day 1, this shows that conditions were more than fair. Afterall no one can take that confidence and self-efficacy he learned under the crucible. In fact, the conditions were \"MORE\" fair than real world.If we buy this lock, stock and barrel.. then it answers as to WHY this senseless violence can be justified. Whereas the cruel outside world kicks people to the curb, here is a perfection opportunity of harmony in anarchy with soldiers in consort with managers acting as the great equalizers.The final window scene was the ultimate culminating point and great capstone to this otherwise bitter critique of capitalism. Yes, many people read the obvious scathing attack on it, and even a Washington Post article highlighted the irony of the fact that they are basking on the same pile of money enabled by the very system they criticized.. But but I don\\'t think it that black and white.If anything, that scene (as well as the previous powerful scene of \\'brother\\' sparing \\'brothers\\' life...) serves as a striking footnote and glaring closure to the triumph of humanity and compassion.Yes, life is cruel. Yes, capitalism enables the powerful and rich to exploit the ones lower at the bottom if not ask for fellatio whilst people are dying like race horses in a bloodsport. Yes, it is a dog-eat-dog world outside....But at the same time like the ever-cliche rose climbing out of stone, so is the power and magic of humanity, hope and love.(And that brings the point even closer to me. I felt I could relate with the protagonist having found myself in a similar situation although priveleged to live in SoCal. But despite living the simple life, I am also aware that eventhough it may seem to be a cruel world out there, it is also a serene one. What would really happen if entire Earth was reduced to a prison as a social experiment? Sans minor glimpses of riots and ever-concurrent wars... human in general are peaceful and righteous. Even though our planet sustains of globalist capitalist economy, look outside the window... Do you see people devolving to their base and depraved instincts? No...Because despite all our flaws, humanity still has the spirit of God within.)Thus in a way, it manages to do the opposite - instead of dissecting the capitalistic eschatology to shards, it drives home the point and highlight that even if human were put in a situation where you are pitted against another for a huge pile-uh-cash, you would still choose compassion over violence. Even if a homeless person is dying on the street, there is still a kind and gentle soul watching over you like guardian. Even if you earn money through a slipknot of violence, you still preserve your humanity and look after those childhood gradnma-aunt who took care of you and took you under their wing like their own son. These.. these values can never be traded no matter how corrupt and diseased our moral compass may seem to reveal otherwise on the exterior. Albeit all it takes a flake of wainscot to break the tipping point and start riots and anarchy as seen from real life and the movie Joker, but under all the seeming inhumanity and cruelty resides a powerful, calm Shiva.On a separate note, this movie also exploded our blinkers as to what Korean lifestyle, culture and movies are about after year after year and movie after movie of kung-fu tropes and what not. It shattered mine at least.. and I never bought the hype mistaking it for being cringy as BTS. Haha...What does blinkers mean anyway...,Koreans don\\'t hold back. They make stuff as real as possible. They show how ruthless life in without any filter. This show was very well made and nicely paced. The games were well thought out and implemented. Even though we kind of know whose gonna win they masked that well. There was also good character choices and development in the film. The plot twist at the end was awesome too. Very mature dialogues and story! The sets were also well thought out and colorful and the background music was unique and fit well. Very entertaining show.,I really liked the show, the beginning for me PERSONALLY was just a bit boring but I clung on and was attached to the show by the end of it. If you have watched the show, you\\'ll know about THAT episode and.. I was speechless and broken by the end of it and it was great, the actors were amazing at portraying all the emotions.The \"VIP\\'s\" voice acting / acting were.. horrid HAHA it was so bad, I just couldn\\'t help laughing. The ending was rough and messy and I wasn\\'t a big fan of it especially how they forced hinted the second season :/Overall, I really recommend it, the show is great, the actors are awesome and you really feel the emotions and the vibes they emitted. It truly was a rollercoaster and I recommend this ride. Each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next.,I started it thinking it to be some intemse thriller with plot twists. But this is Pretentious garbage with no real thrill and not even single interesting twist. Waste of time.,SQUID GAME is a series with a lot of common with HUNGER GAMES\\r\\nin other words it is like hunger game with more fantastic and weird challenges ..The thing that Iliked was the message that it offers\\'\\'Money do not bring happiness\\'\\' and that people can kill their friend for the sake of money\\r\\nit has an intresting plot and actor\\'s performances are good too\\r\\ni was also burst into tears in ep 6BUT there are some disadvantages that should be taken into account ...such as there are tooo many violence scenes that should not exist in my opinion and some plotwist that i had already expected them .The issue with the policeman at the begging was intresting and i thought that he may help competitors to escape but he did not do something important to the plot , he could not to exist or be somehow different.Finally it has a weak ending .. it could be better .To my mind there are such a lot masterpiece of Korean industry and this one is not one of them but i reccomend to watch it only if you are 18+,Squid Game is a barbaric, dramatic, and intense indictment of modern capitalism with very in-your-face demonstrations of poverty, power, and ruthless murder. The acting and the script makes the whole thing come alive and certain episodes, particularly episode 6 and 8, had me on the verge of tears. If you watch them you will understand why. The show has some flaws, mainly some unneeded sex scenes and some questionable plot points. However it hits all the right beats and became the mass hit that it has by demonstrating the ruthless sociopathy of capitalism. This is summed up best at the end with the justification for Squid Game: it was fun.,The concept is pretty good-how far would you go to win a life changing amount of money, especially when you have hit your lowest point? I think a good 2 hour movie would have worked just as well; start by cutting out the entire \"VIP\" nonsense. Everything else was so well scripted and designed, how did that part fail so badly? Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful. This appears overall to be a high value production, great costumes, sets, cinematography, why skimp on something as necessary as captioning?,Folks, it IS entertaining!. However, taking into consideration everything that happens throughout the first sasn, the end is CRAP!If you\\'re like me, someone who takes seriously how the story ends, this would turn into be a disaster!,Really enjoyed this Korean series, It\\'s like Takashi\\'s Castle with a story and severe consequences full of gore, violent and twists and holds no punches which is what I\\'ve come to expect from Korean series/movies. The only only criticism is that the VIP\\'s acting was awful and I hope if a 2nd series is made they get rid of the English speaking actors. I\\'ve also watched Alice in Borderland which was good but this is better and more interesting. I would recommend this series and hope there is a second. If you enjoyed this, watch Battle Royale the \"Hunger games\" superior original.,I liked:\\r\\n1. The plot premise\\r\\n2. The costumes\\r\\n3. The setup\\r\\n4. The plot\\r\\nI disliked:\\r\\n1. The acting is over exaggerated\\r\\n2. Very minimal character development, the majority are unidimensional\\r\\n3. Laughable reactions from most characters\\r\\n4. Many scenes with screaming characters, can\\'t they talk normally?,STRONG start! It gets its tentacles wrapped around you and slowly looses its grip midway without taking a big enough bite of your brain to leave a lasting impression. I think they tried to cram too much while also slowing the pace down. I felt the marble episode was the turning point. It really dragged its feet even tho it introduced so much more story. Had they trimmed the fat and maybe kept it to only a few episodes it could have been great but ultimately it more sinks than swims by the end.,I don\\'t get the hype.. After episode 3 I wanted to just quit watching, but had to finish it. Not worth it. The plot is just weird and I don\\'t get why every asian likr show I watch i feel like everyone is so childish.,I\\'m surprised not that many people caught the main message of the show, as it is actually the reason for the show\\'s popularity.Foreigners (ahem, the USA) import a capitalist ideology to Korea, get people to start rat-racing for money, and those that lost are rejected by the society and receive a second chance, where the Capitalism is purified and speeded up. People compete with lethal consequences in quite random and easy games for an enormous money prize. This is how liberals view capitalism and material success - pure luck based on random, worthless skills for the sick enjoyment of the immoral rich.It\\'s somewhat ironic that in Korea\\'s case we have an easy option to see what would happen to it under the \"other ideology\" by looking at the North. Yes, it\\'s easy to imagine a world without competition and money, but I\\'m afraid you need to populate it with either angels or robots.Other than that, as is the case with many Asian films, there are annoying characters that employ overacting as a method to show their emotions, and who at the end you wish to kill with your own bare hands.On a plus side, it\\'s swift action and the level of violence is what you would expect from a Korean show with a cult following in the West. It flies pretty fast, with only 9 episodes, although the end is pretty unambiguous - Season 2 is coming.,Wanted to give up after episode one\\r\\nManaged to force myself to watch episode 2My oh my what utter drivelWhat are these people give 9-10 scores smoking???Nothing happensThe main character is utterly unlikeableWorst series ever!!So dull.,What\\'s great about this series is that it doesn\\'t just rely on the sensationalist disturbing factors alone, there\\'s a decent plot with well arranged elements in the unravelling the story. The theme of playing for your life isn\\'t necessarily unique but the formula is incredibly well done adapting the story in South Korea based on childhood games while telling a fable of social and economic struggles and what life is worth living for. I thought the main actors were great and we don\\'t get to see enough of these characters but I hope this opens up exposure to more international productions.The production settings were also really impressive, and made the scenes all the more fascinating.I hope Netflix pays the creator the bonus he deserves given its success.,Having watched all the episodes in a few days this was very enjoyable. Despite the games could\\'ve been a whole lot better (Takeshis castle type?) this had likeable and hateable characters to run through the story, some bits were slow paced and certain elements shouldn\\'t have been there and used as a time filler but all in all was very enjoyable esp episode 6. Wish more stuff like this.,As usual, imdb users have poor taste...squid games is one of the most boring series i\\'ve ever watched, too predictable....after the first killings in the first episofe, there is really nothing more to see...the worst part about it is that the protagonist is a freaking idiot.,I went into the show with high expectations purely because of how hyped it has been in the media recently and honestly.. it\\'s good. Not incredible like the media is playing it out to be but for its genre it\\'s probably one of the best I\\'ve seen.I like the concept of this show, definitely reminds me of the hunger games.. all fighting over something with a common goal and everything just happens to fall in to place.. there\\'s a lot of shows/movies like it but at the same time none quite like this one...Unlike most shows that fall in the same category I don\\'t feel like this was too dragged out in anyway, everything had perfect timing and everything added to the plot nicely, it wasn\\'t too repetitive and it continued to surprise me, it had many unexpected events that I honestly highly enjoyed.At first I wasn\\'t quite sure how to feel about the ending.. a second season? Normally shows plummet when there is a forced second season but at the same time I\\'m glad there wasn\\'t just some bland happy ending. Im excited to see how the second season pans out and I\\'ll definitely be watching.,I\\'m not into Korean movies, but I actually binge watched this one. No way to stop until the end. Every episode is a crescendo, until the end.,Some of the characters were so annoying they made you root for them to die. Gi-Hun was one of the most annoying ones. Good action that kept the pace going.,First off the main character is unlikeable. I wasn\\'t rooting for him the entire show. He\\'s not exactly a good person and came off as annoying.Second, it took a LONG TIME for anything interesting to happen. The establishing backstory was very boring and very unnecessary. They could have told us everyone\\'s stories in a couple of quick flashbacks and gone straight into the action!Third, this is not an original concept. I\\'ve seen this type of social commentary done a thousand times in a thousand different ways.Do yourself a favor and go watch Alice in Borderland. It\\'s a much better show.,Recommend!!Just finished watching season one, Somehow this season is good to watch. Eagerly waiting for another season.At first i was confused while watching but after episode two i was enjoying watching 😊... watching taste may be different from person to person but i recommend it to watch once.,I m speechlesss. Love this series.. One of the best.,I didn\\'t even watch any single Korean series or movie before this . This is the first time I watched any Korean series and this series is just mind-blowing .. literally hooked me up in every episode . The director did a fabulous job . And this show is too dark so be mentally prepared before watching this.,A clear entertainer. Choice of actors is exceptional and everyone plays his/her part to perfection. Enough twists and turns to keep you involved throughout.Brilliant and honestly made series.,All the praise for this \"brilliant\" series, full of \"original\" ideas. Go read The Long Walk and The Running Man by Richard Bachman (i.e. Stephen King). The Long Walk was the first novel he wrote (but not the first of his that was published)...it\\'s over 50 years old, and was published over 40 years ago. Nearly everything this series is built on can be found there in a simpler format.,Supporting Characters There is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.Story The story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn\\'t work for me and I think it could have been handled better. Also there are these English speaking VIP\\'s and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.Script The script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles. For the love of everything holy don\\'t watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching.,I could have done without the mandatory woke content from Netflix, as well as the nudity and useless profanity. This stuff brings nothing to the story. I started watching Korean shows because there is none of that, that is before Netflix started to produce content for this country. Other than that, good show and solid acting except for the vips, you know, the evil white men.,So, I just finished watching the Squid Game and I have some contradictory feelings about it. For instance, some episodes get my heart racing. They\\'re so good that you cannot look away from the screen and you start sweating in weird places!!! Then some episodes do very little character development, there is very little drama, there is very little addition to the whole series.Another thing that I think could\\'ve been improved (and maybe should be - if there is to be a second season) is that a lot of times there are enough clues in an episode where you can guess the exactly what is going on. The fact that doesn\\'t ruin the show, must tell you how great it is. But, if you\\'re looking for a big mystery, maybe this isn\\'t your show, because you\\'ll be able to guess what the heck is going on after just a few episodes.,After having seen it, i must say i wasn\\'t quite expecting it to be like this. I expected something savage & stupid like the Hunger Games movies. But this is much more intelligent, emotional & psychological. What starts off as a competition to survive the games gets emotionally disturbing & traumatizing half-way through. It makes you question morals & the dark side of humanity.Please don\\'t watch this show if you\\'re already depressed or going through a sad period in your life, as this show might negatively affect your mental health. There is too much sadness & grimness in this show.If you want to watch something dark, intelligent & original, this is a must watch.,I\\'m almost embarrassed to admit that I committed a whole day in front of this show but it really caught me. Episode 6 had me bawling my eyes out. However, I feel like the last episode was a little disappointed. They tried to make you understand that you won\\'t find happiness in money, but I just feel like the pace and the vibe were a bit off compared to the rest of the show. And such a shame to learn that the character whose \"death\" you mourned the most showed to be the evil guy all along.,I\\'m baffled by the high reviews as I couldn\\'t get past the second episode. The first episode was so cliche in setting up the main character and his situation it was painful to watch. Nothing original, just the same story of a guy that is lazy, steals from his mom, gambles, is a terrible father. Okay, we get it, it\\'s why he goes to play this game. They had a chance to actually use an original approach to this \\'desperate failure\\' needs quick cash, but nope, this series isn\\'t up to it. Then you have to buy into a lot of completely unbelievable situations and places. I found myself fast forwarding through the \\'vote off the island\\' scene. I finally gave up when they started the mom is now in the hospital. This is a soap opera with blood. No more. It\\'s not even funny.I don\\'t recommend this to anyone.,Starting watching in English dubbed and found it to be more amusing than anything. Switched to Korean with subtitles after episode 2 and reading various stories of wrong translation being used. Decent watch but predictable outcome which makes the games less interesting (when you know x y or z is in the next episode) ok twist but frustrating ending. Spoiler alert- who let\\'s a debt ridden drunk just walk away with a random kid who he then leaves with his aunt ?!?!,I liked it. Though I thought I\\'d hate the blood, it reminded me how I used to love to watch the Saw. It\\'s not like the saw, but it\\'s a great concept. And actually the scene that made me almost barf wasn\\'t even blood but a naked man with the mask in the end. The concept it\\'s great because it also shows how dependent people are on money.. these people felt worthless withiut money.. just sad.Now don\\'t read my review if you don\\'t want spoilers.I\\'m just sad that the cip didn\\'t survive and you didn\\'t even show where his body swam and what his boss thinks after that call. Just that made me give you star less.,Don\\'t believe the hype.Don\\'t get me wrong, the show was entertaining and watchable, the cast mostly did a good job, the visuals were good.I liked it. But that\\'s it. I just liked it. I wasn\\'t blown away, it wasn\\'t anything new to me, I won\\'t remember this as a great show, I won\\'t remember it as something that made me think about it a long time after watching.It had nothing that stood out, no great twist, no real depth. Surely some people won\\'t agree on this point, but if you consider the obvious criticism on capitalism shown here as something deep... yeah.I found the build up in the first 4 episodes considerably more enjoyable than the second half of the series. The ending was just ok. Nothing more.So in summary this was solid entertainment. Definitely not worth the hype but enjoyable if you have nothing better to do with your time.,But story line is good. I reserve the right to change this when I\\'m done watching. Nothing so horrible that would make me turn it off. But the English voice actors are not great.,The story is great, but the acting is extremely bad. The dialogues between and durnig the games are totally meaningless.,🔺Next up is a Korean drama that became a sensation on Netflix in a single week, yes it is the same \\'squid game\\'. Thought-provoking presentation away from the regular romantic Korean drama. I \\'ve never seen much Korean drama, so I\\'m sorry if there is anything wrong with what I am saying. Squid is a series with a few plotholes, though not a lot of gameplay, and this series created the impetus to click next after each episode. It is definitely a very entertaining series.🔺The plot of the series is to catch debtors from different parts of Korea, bring them to an island, play six games with them and give a winner 45 billion Korean won. Games are games that were played in childhood in the past. But if you lose the games, you will lose your life !!!🔺As mentioned earlier, the squid game is a perfect item for a binge watch. A not-so-bad survival thriller. Although none of the subplots are excellent, the main plot is very well taken by the director. Those who are just starting to see Korean drama can start from this.,This was a great reminder as to how concept can trump acting and writing. Even with some of the questionable choices of some performers, this show stands on its concept - which, though not new, is executed excellently. One of those that will likely be adapted for a western audience in the future. Solid watch, if you are not distracted by the more dodgy parts, and definitely better than a lot of other shows in the same genre at the moment. Cult classic methinks.,It is a very good show that once must watch. Best thing which I liked about the show is that this has ended in one season only. Other shows unnecessarily drags this to multiple seasons.,Good show but really overhyped. I really thought it would be something special due to all those high praises, but it\\'s nothing original. Gantz was superior. I guess some of the high rating is because some people only caught on how good Korean movies are, I\\'m not sure about TV series compared to US,( because of shows like Breaking Bad, Sopranos ) but for the last 10 years or so, Korean movies are much much better the rubbish that Hollywood have made.,The series is great and worth the watch. I have to admit I already called the twist by the second episode, but the journey was great. The latter part of the season lost its way with some heavy cringe characters but I\\'ll look past that. My biggest gripe comes with the latter part becoming cliché and in violation of what previous episodes had laid down, as in everyone has a fair shot at winning whereas the game they played was in gross violation of that (episode 7). Give it a watch though.,An amazing work of art, direction, script, production and screenplay. Completely engaging until the very last episode. However, the director and his aides made a terrible decision by ending it how it ends. The entire build up to the very last episode comes down crashing for me towards the end of it.It made me change my rating from 8/10 to 6/10.,This show is really good. A \\'BIT\\' like a Korean \\'Hunger Games\\'. The story is great and the struggles that dominate the plot create a lot of great tension. It reeled me in right from the start. Give it an episode and you\\'ll be hooked.The things that hurt it:EXTREMELY poor dubbing. A few of the character\\'s voices are so comically bad that it\\'s pretty cringey at times.One actress is absolutely terrible and should\\'ve been either played by someone else, or the part should\\'ve been written out. So bad.The VIPs are pretty ridiculous.Other than that, I look forward to another season. Not sure what they can do with it after such a great start.,Had me gripped from the beginning to the end.Some plot lines were signposted v obviously but it was still edge of your seat viewing. I love an open end that leaves you imagining your own conclusions. Well acted, good character development, heart breaking and whilst not entirely original it had enough going for it to make it stand out.,I wish I could give it a 100 out of 10. It\\'s a very well-thought-out series. Much is initially clear, but the intrigue was still there for me. Titanic for nine episodes.,I literally freaking screamed. Sae Byeok was easily the best character in the show (sorry Ali) and quite obviously, the ultimate plot armor for the final game between the two men to happen.It was such a shame cause she was the only main character who never played dirty nor tricked anyone in order to win the games (ie In the red light green light game she could\\'ve pushed the antagonist who beat her up but didn\\'t. Only used the knife she smuggled when the antagonist tried to kill her. In the marble game scene, aka the most depressing shh ever, she insisted on playing fair). Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom\\'s vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn\\'t help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead.,I like the way the movie builds the main character.-The supporting characters also have their own story that makes the film more in-depth.-The game steals a lot but is improved.-The later episodes are not as good as the first ones but not too bad-Overrated , but not the problem.Just enjoy. Watch the movie if you\\'re tired of looking for a new movie.,The show hooks you right away on the first episode, but as the climax comes into play along with some supposedly plot twists being revealed, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.The characters don\\'t make sense, especially Gi Eun and Sang Woo. Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let\\'s say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don\\'t buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. He is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don\\'t get what he\\'s thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It\\'s not within his character to stab himself. He didn\\'t even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok.The reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already.We also don\\'t get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.I had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.In retrospect, I think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. The actors did a fine job, and I think it\\'s within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn\\'t buy happiness then it works out. But this ending? CHEAP.6.5.,It is nothing but an overhyped series . Games are made for fun . Here some psycho people somehow target bankrupt people to play game . Those who failed are killed by armed guard . Sometimes players took the life of each other . One winner among 456 people . Two twist as expected . It\\'s a total waste for me . Nothing to learn from this idiotic series .,Saw the trailer and wasn\\'t going to watch. But then a friend recommended and insisted that I watched.Binged through it over one weekend and found it intriguing but not earth-shaking for me. The concept was interesting, and the moral of the story was powerful. The execution was great, from the movie making, shock value, and financial gain was amazing for sure.The story was simple to bring in desperate people to play games with their lives. The cruelty and brutality were the shock to most viewers. Yet, there were the body part scene which was too gruesome and the undercover policeman has no impact to the story line.And then, there was the ending ....,That\\'s is the masterpiece of Netflix but the end is not very good so that I give it 9 star but if thay make another season that will be different.,This is in my top 10 shows for sure! Loved the acting the story, even the fan favourites will die so don\\'t get to comfourtable watching this!,Not gonna lie it did take me awhile to watch this show. But I gotta say. It was great. I actually really enjoyed it. I surprisingly liked a lot of the characters. I thought it was fun. I was infested in the story. Episode 2 did feel a little pointless. The last episode was probably my favorite. And yeah a great show that definitely deserves a second season.,This is although has some ideas copied from Hostel series of movies.. it has more depth. Feelings human\\r\\nflaws, and suspense. Although the English voice over\\r\\nwas more funny then the best it could of been done!Better then anything out of hollywood lately\\r\\nand its not ruin by wokeness.. the real female\\r\\ncharacters are strengths and color in this series\\r\\nwithout pushing things in your face.Although the plot and ending was obviously\\r\\nthe twists at the end.. it didnt let it down overall for me.,This show is extremely violent, which makes it hard to watch. There is not a sufficient payout at the end of the season to justify all the violence. I\\'m not sure my brain can unsee 100s of people shot point blank in the head.,Just watch Kaiji, it\\'s ten times better.Same ideas, better execution. The characters are boring and aside from good visuals this has nothing really entertaining.Zawa zawa.,I sat for months, waiting for the next amazing Korean show, being extremely \"Sweet Home\"sick (I\\'m a dad, I\\'m allowed to make dad jokes.) Squid game popped up mid September, and I thought... maybe!But nope.Now I have to review it because, for whatever reason, it got popular recently.The visuals were great.Therein lies the positives.Now for the negatives.First off, stop calling it a Korean drama. It\\'s not. (Of course, neither is Sweet Home.) It\\'s a drama/thriller made in Korea for Americans. Korean dramas are a completely different genre.It starts with the same premise we\\'ve read a billion times. The 13 tzametti, Truth or dare, question of \"how far would you go for money?\" Likewise answered with the basic premise inspired by The Most Dangerous Game.From this non original start... it actually devolves. It devolves into a shallow Battle Royale, with false (and woefully unoriginal) social commentary delivered with a lack of subtlety that would make Andrew Ridker jealous. Then ends with a disappointing attempt at an altruism message. We saw, I swear, more depth in the Hunger Games series. Take that as you will.I know, seeing the success of the MCU, that people like their literary themes shoved in their faces these days, rather than delivered in a real story, and on that account, I can say Squid Game did superb work.I rarely ask for true originality, because I know there is nothing new under the sun, but if you make me a PB&J, and make a spectacle out of it, like you invented it, I hate you.If you want good Korean television with real (albeit, at times, also not so subtle) social commentary, just wait for season 2 of Sweet Home with me.Last notes: Acting is distractingly inconsistent, the characters aren\\'t real people (I mean, the caricatures,) and the \"twist\" may be effective if you\\'ve never read a book or seen a movie.,Was genuinely looking forward to watching what I had been led to believe was a bonefide classic. What a huge disappointment. Dreadful acting, appalling dialogue and just boring beyond belief. Dont believe the hype, this is utter rubbish.,Strange mix of funny, childish elements with violence. Similar to The Cube or Danger Room movies with different people having to go through a labyrinth of horrors but done in a comedy style.,Simply immersive. Thats my general consensus. I am only up to episode 4?(i am binging it so lost track) but this is almost meditative - the scope of this. The filmaking is on another level. Its so revolutionary, everything in it. Dont want to spoil it. Must watch..the acting is just superb and it will keep you guessing.The genre not to spoil is mystery/dystopia.,Truly a well-directed, well-acted, well-produced and casted series. I dare say I wish it could continue, but all games must end to have a victor!Thank you for this very bingeworthy story. Thank you all cast and crew involved. Despite not knowing more than 3 words in Korean I recognized several actors. Goes to show, Hollywood ain\\'t everything!*To those that find this \\'boring\\', please understand you need Michael Bay or shiny keys to keep your attention. *snap* Hello?! Are you listening?!*,Gut wrenching. Dark. Predictable ending. Honestly, couldn\\'t stomach it first four episodes. Last four, were easy to read and not so entertaining. Should have gotten on the plane and ended this series. He could have followed through with one thing in his life. Guess his daughter really isn\\'t important. What was the point of her storyline?,Concept is like a revival of battle royale (loosely) and very brutal. I was watching with an open jaw on episode 1. Slightly deteriorated a tad with each episode.I couldn\\'t invest in any character enough to care. Don\\'t make a second series and let this stand alone as a solid series itself. Like they should\\'ve done with a Handmaids Snail.,This show start amazingly thrilling, until the fourth game this show became predictable and the characters are overacting, unlike the VIPs their acting make me cringe to the bone.The fourth game was great tho, Ali\\'s innocence face got me, seo-byeok and ji-yeong friendship, Il-nam the old man (and we found out that he is the founder of the squid game), and the policeman finally met his brother and he\\'s dead like for what?Lastly, the ending, the ending was too long and boring.,Its been a while since the last time time stopped while watching a series. A long waited time.,I saw this before the hype train departed the station and I was hooked from the very first episode. My only gripe was some of the characters voices from the dubbed version when I watched it the first time round. Gi-Hun\\'s voice was very dopey in the dubbed version and Mi-Nyeo\\'s voice was so screechy and irritating her character was almost unbelievable.On the flip side of that, I\\'ve just finished watching it in Korean with subtitles and it changed the whole thing for me. It makes it much more serious, \\'believable\\' and gripping than the dubbed version.Its not going to blow your mind or change your world, but it\\'s simplicity, gripping storyline, thought provoking nature and brutality is where it\\'s attractive. It\\'s definitely worth a watch.,It\\'s derivative, but throw away fun? It has some interesting ideas, but is basically a silly fun way to spend a few hours. All this deep meaning crap, is really not appropriate, as it is not particularly insightful or original. The masses seem to love it because it\\'s easy for them to understand and is an accessible silly show that they can discuss with their friends. I really hope there is not a season 2..........but as it is a big fat cash cow for Netflix, and is making tons of merch money, it\\'s inevitable. If you want to watch something better than catch Battle Royale or read a book ha!,Some of the best cinema I have ever seen originates from South Korea. They are masters at layering dubious qualities on their protagonists, which often makes the lead characters quite unpredictable, yet still very relatable.For too long Western cinema has followed the narrative that the \\'good guy\\' has to be a \\'nice guy\\'.... when in fact, the majority of us look out for our own self interests when push comes to shove.I feel like the writers left a few plot holes here and there.... but overall Squid Game was very entertaining. I gave it a 9/10 despite its shortcomings.,It\\'s a fun and engaging show. It kind of reminds me of Oldboy, but oldboy is a movie and better. I hated the VIPs and some plotholes annoyed me.,I wish they would do more like this. Edge of your seat stuff every episode. The hype is real! I hope that there is a sequel and that it is equally as good! No pressure!,Basically a Gore horror show like \"The Hostel\" but bubble tea store like colours and Costumes worn which gave the audience a thrilling experience of this \"weird feeling\" because our brains usually don\\'t connect Horror with Happy colours. So yes this show is meant for those who love death and has desires to watch others being killed - for the psychopathic audience.,Positive surprise, we know long ago that there is no more creative movies or shows from US, everything is just copy paste zero creativity. This show was so unique and strange I really enjoyed it. It starts really slow and I almost gave up on it. But once the first game starts the crazy stuff starts happening.. great work guys !P. S to Netflix Bring back Real PRIME STAR TREK YOU MORON. S ! I will unsubscribe!,I eventually got down to watching Squid game, and even getting a review out was very late. But here goes...Squid Game is great. One of the best shows of the year for sure, there is so much to pick apart of why I love this show. From a show that dives into narratives like classism, and society . How far will you to get out of a horrible place, what are you willing to sacrifice, and int he end will it really be worth it. Squid Game asks these questions through some great characters, some great visual imagery and a unnerving sound and audio you make you feel uneasy and of course great storytelling to get to that point.The idea about a battle royale format is nothing new, but it takes something like Squid Game to make it something special.Over time the series really makes you get into all the characters and their backstory and why they have come to this point. So when something happens to them you feel it emotionally. And the characters are complex, they are not one note, they all feel like they need to be there and you get why. And a show doing that in this type of format is rarely done well these days. The key to this show is its characters, and the actors that portray them put in all the effort to make it work, I wasnt disappointed by anyone.Only complaint I really have is the ending, I wasnt a massive fan of the reveal but it didn\\'t take away too much. The journey to this point had been amazing so I was still left satisfied regardless.I rarely dabble in Korean cinema but every time I have I get a surprise like this. Very pleased with the results and am happy to have watched, even if it was later than most.,I\\'m a huge movie person, very rarely do I watch series...... I binged this! I watched it with the English dub (this is something you forget about by episode 2), I don\\'t care what you say, I enjoyed it just as much as I would subtitles. Great acting, awesome writing, very, very cool concept. I also don\\'t buy the narrative everyone\\'s barking about the bad VIP acting. They were likely casted to be unintelligent and rather elementary. This was actually cool to me because it made me think not everyone in power is smart and \"scripted\". This was the least of my concerns. Really enjoyed this one!,This is actually good i gotta admit but it feels like kaiji like in every way.,NOT A REAL SPOILER, BUT REVEALS THE TYPE OF SPOILER THAT EXISTSThe setup is great and everything is very intriguing, but by the end you realise not many of your questions were ever answered in a satisfying way. Clearly, there has to be another season, but I was hoping at least some of my questions would be well answered at the end of this one, even if they led to more questions. There were some reveals, but they didn\\'t make much sense given what had already happened. They couldn\\'t really have been foreseen. There wasn\\'t enough information provided beforehand. It\\'s just \"you heard of this guy, right? Well, this guy is also this guy for some reason.\" Not juicy. Not juicy at all. It\\'s like they answered the setup with another setup. I also feel like some characters didn\\'t ever reach their potential. But maybe that\\'s the point.What I liked was the look of the show, the atmosphere (soundtrack!), the characters, the acting, the humour, while it was there, and the concept. I definitely care enough about what\\'s happening to watch season 2. There are some loose ends I\\'m glad were left loose.MINOR SPOILER IF GOING IN BLINDI also wish that the Netflix thumbnail/cover thing wouldn\\'t reveal so much about violence of the game. Before anyone started getting killed, I knew people were going to get killed, so it wasn\\'t as shocking as it was supposed to be. Paired with the foreshadowing of the whole slapping-in-the-train-station thing beforehand, I think the first game would have been a cool reveal. Maybe I just listened to the hype too late.,I m falling shortage of words. All i can say is it is 100/100 and a must watch for all thriller show lovers. All episodes are worth watching.,This is the best \"Death Game\" / \"Battle Royal\" type of show I\\'ve seen in years. There are a dime-a-dozen of these shows in the anime / Japanese world and Squid Game is the best one in a long while. What\\'s usually wrong with these shows is that they have a super natural element (gods, aliens) to them or outrageous reasoning as to how or why these games are evening taking place. That and the general writing is kind of ... well ... awful ... since these shows are usually about mass killing and the sick ways contestants have to be punished rather than concentrating on the actual characters.It\\'s the well written character dialogues and backgrounds that keep you hooked, not the senseless violence on screen. Squid Game understands this. The best episodes are the ones with no direct violence to them. They will crush you.In other shows \"aliens\" or what seems to be literally a handful of people are running the whole thing. That\\'s not good enough for me. Squid Game keeps it simple. Humans (a lot of them actually) run the show, and humans kill each other. I really appreciate the logistical side of the show, it keeps it grounded.As for the negatives, there is a small subplot involving a doctor that\\'s really not that relevant to the show. Later in the season there\\'s a group of people that you\\'ll encounter and they are horribly acted. You\\'ll notice it immediately when you get to it. Otherwise, amazing show, hope for another successful season 2 in the future.,Very cool\\r\\nWay way better than the Hunger Games.... Its in the same twisted vein as the recent Japanese TV series Alice in BorderlandA must watch.,I cannot, for the love of God, imagine why this became so popular.1. The acting is atrocious. Super over the top, absolutely unbelievable, cringeworthy at best.2. The main character has hardly any character development and is difficult to identify with (also due to very very poor acting).3. The plot is super predictable and sometimes completely lacks logic (like with the policeman). If you think this is original watch \"Oldboy\" or \"Battle Royale\", \"Saw\" or \"Hunger games\" for pointless violence. These movies were made 20 years ago and, even though they are not good imo, they are far better than Squid game.4. The whole game is pointless and hard to understand. The reason why certain characters behave in a certain way is random and not at all explained. The scenario is lousy and dialogues are laughable.There is literally nothing good about this series. Waste of time. If you want something similar on Netflix from Korea then watch \"Hellbound\". It is leagues better than \"Squid game\" as it has good acting, a surprisingly deep story and a lot of realism in spite of the CGI and fantasy elements.,Man I almost forgot what it was like to watch a show that\\'s pure escapism and not Preachy at all, no Politically correct western BS here, no forcing Trans people down our throats, no throwing in some artificially diverse cast, no overly feminist BS, so refreshing to watch a show with a great concept that isn\\'t ruined by Western ideology, I\\'ve never watched a South Korean show before but may start being my new favorites.,What are people prepared to do for money and survival? A lot obviously.Our poor protagonist- a sympathetic middle aged man with No luck in life gets the chance to participate in some kind of game Where to lose means elimination and elimination means death. The show is cruel and twisted in Ways that are hard to imagine. The actors are good and i like the hero - that was the only reason i followed through the whole show. If it wern\\'t for those things i had given it a below average rating. This was a sick show to say the least.,... the killings. The deaths are slow, graphic, cruel, in a great magnitude, and methodical.The good :\\r\\nThe first 20 minutes of Episode 1 are pure genius and beautifully acted out, not to mention all the real world scenes being quite moving.The premise itself is not about people playing games to get money; it\\'s a very political TV series regarding wealthy people and possibly wealthy countries (note *all* portrayed as English speaking with American accents, except for the original Korean game creator) paying to watch the death games of those South Koreans forced into it from sheer poverty and circumstances.This series is an excellent embodiment of what selfishness and greed do on a grand scale. Rich people paying to see killings to pass the time.. and the need for people to help one another.The problem :\\r\\nbeing what it preaches against.Showing killings in such great detail and magnitude as a TV Series, moves this from being educational to actually profitting off of what it (in premise) is speaking out against.There is a difference between a film making a point with a graphic moment, versus a TV series using that same point over, and over, spending most episodes embellishing slow, atrocious, selfish deaths -- making money off of what it is saying is wrong with the world.If it\\'s so wrong, why are you showing it in such repetitive, graphic detail and making money off of it for the run of your series?This writer/ director has a wonderfully adept hand at directing, cinematography and storytelling as shown in the real world moments of this TV series. So he should certainly know how to show a piece of the atrocities, rather than making the viewers \"VIP\\'s\" themselves. Thankfully I have fast forward so I got through the gruesome, repetative oppressive bloodshed and strangenesses... to enjoy the really earthy, complex storyline and acting inbetween.,In recent months I have become a big fan of the South Korean Dramas, and when this one was recommended to me by one of my students, as the most popular show in Russia right now, with school kids, i thought it would be worth a watch.Disappointed. I can only assume it was not made for the SK market, but was rather produced for and with the influence of the US one, as the whole thing lacks what makes the SK dramas so enjoyable. Primarily, there is little to no humour in it, which even the darkest of their serials have, and secondly, it is so predictable, whereas every other one I have seen has major twists in the stories they keep you engaged from start to finish. In fact, it is a pale imitation of the Netflix Japanese series \"Alice in Boarderland\"\\r\\nAdd to that, the cast lacked the intrinsic beauty of the SK actors, and it just bears not a jot of similarity to what makes their shows so good.The final evidence that this is not what it claims is apparent in the blades. What am I talking about? Well, but SK censorship law, blades of any kind must not be shown on camera; if you watch any of the other serials you will see that any knife, sword, axe, hatchet etc is blurred out, like the face of a witness in a real-life crime show.I watched the whole series and feel that this is an insult to what might be called a genre. If you.want to see a really good SK series, the best I have seen so far is Move to Heaven.,Only 6 or 7 episodes worth of material stretched to 9.The American dialogue is pure shallow stereotype trash compared to the Korean\\'s. You could still make them bad, but given them decent lines. Even the worst Korean parts had meaningful dialogue and had some sympathetic qualities.The script played a decent 8 and 2/3\\'s innings. The last out could have gone for the fences, but instead was a meaningless 3rd strike check swing.,I enjoyed this series. The acting was great even with subtitles! I was immediately drawn into this series and the characters. I really thought this was going to end a certain way but it did not. If you love horror and I guess Saw franchise this is up your alley too.,Very gripping show and the characters have done a fab job..\\r\\nVery well stiched show\\r\\nLoved it\\r\\nCan\\'t wait for S2.Totally new content.... Have never seen something ofnthis sort.Emotions...Actions...Thrill...,What a tremendous watch . Riveting series . Wasn\\'t expecting this at all . Ended up being an all time classic. The Koreans have nailed it yet again . Hats off to them . Korean drama is now fast becoming the best in the business. Flawless .,OUTSTANDING...Well after knowing about the hype I decided to watch it on weekend and now I am empty, speechless.The performance from main lead was so satisfying and real, the concept was creative and allow imagination, this is what we called perfect mind-boggling cinema and episode 6 will going to stay there for a long long time....\\r\\nMust watch....,A fantastic tale of a group of humans, laden with debt, play games in the hope of winning cash prize.Great acting, interesting plot glues you to the series, from start to end.This is not just another play a game of death story.Squid game definitely raises the bar on drama and story telling.,I loved most of the series but I think the end of this first season made no sense. Why the red hair color? He wanted the money to be a good father but when he won it feels like he completely forgot about his daughter... I really disliked the way the handle the end.,This show is violent and there is a lot of death in it.But it is compelling and well shot.Don\\'t speak Korean so I cannot comment on the translations or the voice acting of dub people.,I enjoyed Squid Game but feel it\\'s rather overrated. I\\'ve been a big fan of far eastern and in particular Japanese and Korean movies for many years. Lady Vengeance and Oldboy in particular stuck with me. So many people have been talking about Squid Game, I was expecting a little bit more. When you know there are twists, even ones you don\\'t expect, they don\\'t really come as a surprise.,Turned off on the preview - the VIPs were that bad.,Season 1 rated 8. 7 if they make another.This series expresses an aspect of Korean movie culture, which wants to show people in their worst poor helpless stateA recent Korean movie got so famous, and it showed how people live in home of others without getting detected. Similar kind of movies are something that Korean society seems to enjoy. Watch the destituteness helplessness of urban poor. It is not the VIPs that are making this game play and them enjoying it. It the well feed society of Korea that wants to enjoy others with lesser means of survival in our present capitalistic society getting ripped off the basic necessities for living. America has done it\\'s part of making a society completely opposite of communist North. Completely filled with big shopping heaven, richness, laviousness, go to place to have plastic surgeries, so and soAsk yourself, what society would it be where large crowd would gather in a colosseum to watch gladiators killing each others right in front. People killing each other, getting killed and there it just one survivor. How cruel it is.Series showed that this game is played for many decades.. Seriously.. no flaws in it? Wasn\\'t there Korean Bruce Lee or Rambo to save the day? All this years and no one detected it? Every year 455 dying on this earth and police didn\\'t know or attempted to catch them?Rule of the game is if anyone wants to quit the game they will be eliminated. So don\\'t people should know that elimination means being killed? It\\'s only after round 1 does people know about it. Rules should be in essence clear and not be coded or with a duel meaning. Rule of rules is not followed. Round 1 was with so many unnecessary killings.One day before I read in news of best and topmost reputation from UK, that this series is getting more and more liked across nations. But there main topic in the news was that the English subtitles are not doing good justice to the excellent Korean dialogue. Again seriously.. Why would a English knower will be bothered about minor translation loss or miscommunication. We are watching it more then actually reading subtitles line by line. Many Korean who knows English well enough have to say this about subtitles. How will it affect? By getting better appreciation? Answer from me is no!Apart from it, the best thing is the setup of the games and the rooms. It seems that set production was one excellent piece of work. Perfection in the making feel that that\\'s where a game should be played. The colors the dresser the clean act except of course by VIPs.I enjoyed the series but I am sorry, the meaning of Korean movie culture shows an aspect that is darker then one may think.,Things I LOVED: the music, the cinematography, the writing, the story, the metaphors. It was really good!Things that I didn\\'t love: the ending, the actors playing the VIPs (so bad in comparison to the main characters that it watered down the other actors\\' performances) and the hand feeding of things that we are supposed to remember. The fun is realizing you remember on your own!I still recommend watching obviously!,If you have nothing else to do then give it a try.The characters are a cliche, the story is the same old good evil greed narrative, the concept is ok and the cop-brother storyline is just boring.It reminded me of Gantz! They could have added some elements from the anime and make it better. It would have been a good mix.Overall, 6/10.Take your popcorn, your drinks, your chicken wings and enjoy.,For me, the first few episodes was a definite 8 in my books. But it started to be a bit boring and predictable in the last couple episodes. The glass game did not feel like an old children game. A new take on hopscotch perhaps. When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn\\'t get Frontman\\'s motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds. I guess setting the narrative this way opens the possibility of a season 2.I get the high ratings and hype, but beneath it all its a not-too-bad series worthy of a 6.,This is everything wrong with modern film-making. The whole thing lacks any logical sense, it drags on for way too long, the games are moronic and unimaginative, the characters are shallow, there is not even an attempt at creating some nuance and emotion, I would have more compassion watching chicken die than this absolutely ridiculous man-slaughter. The main character is this completely unremarkable John battered by life that only occasionally yells angrily at the world. All of it is just one huge waste. If you get a thrill of seeing people dye on screen for no reason, all decorated in ridiculous settings and surrounded with PlayStation-like mask people, go for it though. It\\'s literally that, nothing more.,...would have been more intimidating if their cylinders had been loaded!,To be honest I have only watched two episodes. Reminds me of Parasite- the crazy disregard for human life. I will continue to watch it- am having a hard time with the gore.,I\\'m obsessed because its amazing show. However...sometimes it has a little weird \\'feeling\\'. Somethings off. Maybe its the eng dabing, that make it \\'overacted\\'. I wish I was fluent in Korean, I\\'d enjoy it more.. but dont get me wrong it was AMAZING. The first game, the marbles... I really cant wait for the second season..🦑,I am not an amateur to be fooled by ratings, flashy reviews and mainstream opinion, I watch a series/movie with an unbiased mind and judge it accordingly, this was just trash, Ep1-3 were somehow good, but in a very ordinary way, after that, utmost piece of crap, completely overrated with hundreds of stupidity...What was with the last fighting scene? Three stabs, one to the leg, one to the stomach and another one right through his hand, and he is still standing and fighting, while one bite on the ankle, and the other guy is done, what the hell?The cop and his frontman brother, what was that about? Extremely irrelevant and added absolutely nothing to the story, just what was the whole point of it except just wasting time?And don\\'t get me started with the VIP\\'s, just duh....Long story short, watch the hunger games....,Stylish, graphic and enjoyable. The lead character got on my nerves but hey ho. The whole film has a great style both visually and musically. It somehow reminded me of Clockwork Orange. Watch it and see.Others have gone into it but the whole style sticks with you and the game scenes are what you would hope for. Some great things coming out of South Korea of late. Train to Busan is a great example. A must see.,Very disturbing with grotesque violence. Poor acting, poor story. Why that hell were the \\'supposedly good guys\\' feeling sorry for themselves when they voluntarily rejoined the games - the killings, deaths were inevitable but the main guy still wanted the moral high ground. Just a poor, very disturbing show, with all the grotesque violence and a poor ending. The main character only went back for the money, he knew in order to win others have to die. But now, he doesnt want to use the money and is annoyed at the killings - you cant have it both ways mate!!!. Please save your time and life and don\\'t bother watching this show.,Awesome combination of Drama, suspense, thrill & A small demo of today\\'s World.Must watch, its fictional but I\\'ll give you some true life lessons, who is your friend, who is your enemy.,I was skeptical of the show since it had so much hype, but it was an amazing show by far. This show will keep you entertained almost the whole way through. The only part i wish wasn\\'t in it was the vips they contributed nothing imo. Other than that this show was the bomb.,This series was overated by viewer, try to watch this and Believe me this series was just typical korean movie. Too much drama. Like every korea movie, life conflict, problem blah blah...you expect this in any korean movie.,Acting- great! Story- great! Fun-Tons of fun!!!! I loved this!!!!!!!! I wonder if there will be another season. Either way I enjoyed every episode. I\\'m trying not o give spoilers but I really really enjoyed this show. Directing and set was great. All the actors did a phenomenal job. Kudos to the Director. Great storytelling!!!!,One of best series I have ever watched. The story is so simple but effective and extraordinary. The games are so relatable yet bloody dangerous. That old man is the heart of this story. There are lots of things you can relate in your daily life with this story. Outstanding.,The series is good mediocrity at best. But it seems to hit the nerve of the times and will be back to normal. Fortunately, all hype is over.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,The show is decent although the 3 last episodes could\\'ve been better but I still enjoyed the action and the storyline.,This show was good better than most shows nowadays. The story in general was good with some nices twists near the end and left us with unanswered questions.,This seems to be popular only because of the recent hype around Korean pop. Good idea but poorly executed, the series has some flashes of brilliance but is overrall weighed down by the poor dramatization. Discussing the VIPs is a waste of time.,It is quite hard to review the whole series . Because each episode gives a unique portrait .The idea is good old fashion Japanese way with some new modern technology. The main concept is well demonstrate. My best moment is at the last one, when the main hero and a old man playing games weather the homeless guy will get help or not.The rich see the world in another sense. But the life goes on inhuman way towards the poor people. This series gives some visual, good concept , business and class exploitation with Japanese work culture. Among 9 episode the 3 episodes are good. Over all good for nice time pass.,This show was nothing like what i expected. When I saw the the trailer , it made me to watch squid game so bad . The directed and the screenplay writer are the best ... The graphics , the twists , the games , wow !! , I am blown up by this show .. Tbh this would be my fav show of all time ...,Overhyped series.This is just an average series nothing more.I don\\'t know why so much hype about the series.Looks. Like a marketing gimmick by Netflix.,This is the bravest, most intelligent show I\\'ve seen in years, absolutely blown away by the thoughtfulness in the script. There\\'s so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.The first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that\\'s known as debt. It uses the the Korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. This makes watching the series so much more relatable.Another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. The depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a Hollywood film. I personally felt the pain for the father.The fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. Ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. Nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.Overall, I feel this series is deep and thought provoking. It blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. Though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. So, spare a thought for someone around you who\\'s in financial needs and offer them some help. I think that\\'s the message from the filmmakers.,What could I say about this overly budgeted piece of horrid excuse of a series. The story isn\\'t very original, the plot and dialogue are very dull, boring and just bad. The most thrilling part of an episode is when it ends. The characters are unoriginal and poorly acted. I could go on but I will not be tearing my eyes out anymore and waste another thought with this.If someone can enjoy this I would like to know what it is that makes this even barely something to waste time on. If there\\'s something good about this it is the cinematography. Some scenes were well shot and granted the feeling of some of it being real. Although when the props were involved, that \"joy\" faded away faster than it began and made it impossible to ever feel immersed to the world.Unwatchable. Wouldn\\'t recommend.,An absolute thriller! The comedy gets you off guard even in the midst of a nail biting story! Enjoyed it.,Wow he seemed clueless. And selfish before the game, then somewhat unselfish during, unless it suited him. But it would have been nice to have a smarter lead character.,Still I can\\'t call it original and it kind of missed making a point. Left me with mixed thoughts about what was the author\\'s purpose. And a second season?! Seriously? Definitely I will not watch another.,Starts off interesting, but quickly becomes burdened with annoying characters and overly drawn out episodes. In the end I found it be completely boring.,The series feels inspired by the Hunger Games. However, it is average when compared to it. I am a little surprised by the hype as it is not massively original. It started exciting; I was hooked initially, then sometimes I found the pace was a little slow.Overall, it\\'s an excellent show, but undoubtedly not one of the greatest when you look at the ratings. It is not as memorable as you may think. I guess the fact that voices were dubbed on Netflix made it more enjoyable.Great show overall.,This is fantastic! I watched the version dubbed in English, and it felt natural, not forced. Such a cool story, each episode is exciting and good fun. People have said they don\\'t like the VIPs acting, but I think it\\'s appropriate for those characters to have no real depth, they\\'re supposed to be superficial people. Have a watch for an ace fun series, I watched the lot over a couple of nights :D.,Is this original? To play a game and having your life at risk? No.Go and watch \"The Cube\", \"Saw\", Hunger Games \",... etc.It started ok, but i think it lacked an original ending. Having a rich guy betting on people life\\'s was an expected ending. The movie \"Hostel\" already touched this point, having people kidnapped to allow the rich to kill them.. \"entertain the rich in a sadistic way\".Each episode nothing new appeared, more and more stupid kid games... just got worse.Season 2 will be just rewind and repeat with diff people and diff games (don\\'t expect anything new),An enjoyable watch, but personally I liked Alice in Borderland from last year better. Very similar idea, but more interesting games and characters.In squid game nothing really unexpected happened.And the dinner in the end reminded me very much of hunger games- which as well has more or less the same story.But all together still very solid an a 7 for me.,Maybe \"Train to Busan\" spoiled me with its naturalistic performances, but this series seems proud of characters that scream every line and act so over-the-top and hammy that it\\'s ridiculous. I\\'ve sampled both the original Korean version as well as the English dubbed version, and both are equally guilty. Some of the leads are better than others, of course, but the hams overshadow them, making this feel oddly amateurish in places.,Big fuss in Greece with that show. After watching the last episode, i still can\\'t understand why. Because it was something new and different? Because it was Korean? Who knows.It was watchable and that is the end of it imo.Battle Royale & Hunger Games all over again.8,1 is waaaaay too high guys.,It\\'s OK, there are some story-holes, which are probably in place because they want to make a second season. All in all it has an appealing (sometimes comic) korean movie aesthetic, but I liked Kung Fu Hustle (2004) much better.,I don\\'t really get all the hype. This is far from a masterpiece in any way, but it\\'s entertaining. It\\'s a little bit like Prison Break, lots of flaws but entertaining. The concept is really nothing new, just a rehash of the Hunger Games (which was pretty much a blatans rip-off of Battle Royale) and the acting sometimes reminds you of silent movies from a hundred years ago. Maybe that\\'s a cultural thing though, I don\\'t know, but Parasite didn\\'t suffer from this. Never the less it brings you out of the story.I really wish it was as good as it\\'s hyped up to be because I really like the concept. I feel the same way about this as I felt about Hard Target when that came out: \"Why film did you have to let me down?!\",This is first Korean TV show I watched. I\\'ll be honest, If the internet wasn\\'t so full of it, I wouldn\\'t watch it at all. It was something new, nothing like I saw before. It\\'s interesting, but some moments were very cruel, but in the same time frames were so multicolor, that the show was not so depressed. The main idea of the show I liked.,For the most part this show was excellent ... intriguing and different it kept me coming back to see how it would end . The filming and editing weren\\'t always great and don\\'t get me started on some of the acting but all in all I enjoyed the first 8 episodes . The end was the problem ... the last episode was a major snooze fest and don\\'t see how this show can have a 2nd season .,First going into this I was hesitant it seemed like a typical portrayal of an indebted person doing anything to be free however it just kept getting better each episode. Every character was very important to how the story progresses and the acting was phenomenal expect for when the VIPs arrived. I really hope they decide to continue the show for a second season.,So far this tv is muck. Avoid. Absolute rubbish. Watch something else or just go for a walk. Can\\'t understand all the hype. Totally a waste of my time.,Even while deliberately turning my brain off some blunders were too glaring to ignore (namely the VIPs, who were an insult to the main cast). Even so, seeing the internet collectively enjoy and meme a piece of media makes me happy. You could also say I was in love with Sang-woo, so that contributes to my overall rating...,Good show, great 6th episode...but the best on TV history like some reviewers said??? Cmon, there is been a hype in the last years that people is saying the last TV show they just end watching is the GOAT. Those reviews are biasing the ratings on IMDB. It is Ok not to score 10 on a review.....,If you want to know what the Global Elites & Central Planners think of you.As well as what the \"VIPs\" find entertaining in manipulating the plebs & playing with their lives - this is a great pseudo-documentary!,Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality ,honesty,sacrifice,smartness,cunningness and so on.This series is definitely worth your time and will hook you up to watch the season at a single stretch.,I get the hype around this series, I just don\\'t agree with it.It\\'s about a game that consists of multiple kids games. If you win one of those games, you go to the next round, but if you lose, you die. The person who wins the last game gets all the money.The plot is basic and unoriginal. I feel like everyone can come up with it and it reminds me of a lot of other films I\\'ve already seen.The worst thing about it, is that it\\'s too predictable. I could already tell who would die and who would win after watching the first episode. That made it not exciting of course, because I was never scared for people to die. There were plot twists, but they just didn\\'t surprises me and it wasn\\'t as emotional as people said it was. I haven\\'t shed a single tear, while I normally cry a whole ocean when I watch a simple Disney film.I\\'m not saying this is the worst thing ever, maybe it just isn\\'t for me. I don\\'t regret watching it, but I\\'m not waiting for a second season either.,There were no squids in this series. The title clearly mentions squids. But there are no squids? Very disappointing and somewhat misleading. Why is it called the Squid Games if there aren\\'t any squids in the show?,This show started with great screenplay and emotions , after watching first episode I didn\\'t stop it excited to see, when the 5th game starts its totally collapsed and boring games it dragged to 9 episodes jst 8 episodes or enough\\r\\nI were really disappointed with that poor finish literally I didn\\'t like it started like horrible and ended like smooth\\r\\nBut it\\'s a decent watch let\\'s hope they can comeback in season 2 strong.,Superb show if you watch till end. Because the suspense, that who is behind all that and why these games are happening, we understand.It\\'s little bit slow series but we all have to watch this series above 18 ages.Wating for season 2......,Literally had to stand up from my coach and pace, it\\'s so intense and very well done!,Episode 1 starts off a bit too slow but towards the end things get interesting. Episode 2 to 7 is amazing and provides something a bit different from what we\\'ve seen in the past year or so.Episode 8 and 9 are terrible, they don\\'t make any sense! I really don\\'t want to include too many spoilers in this review.Overall, we\\'ll done to the main characters. The acting was amazing!!!!,Interesting plot with an anxiety enducing tone. While I think the show declines a bit in quality towards the end, it\\'s still a series I very much enjoyed.,You can take out the second episode of the show and still have the same story. Does it matter that the detective has breached the ranks of the squidlords? No\\r\\nDoes it matter that they showed us why every (main) character is going back in? No, theres 2 episodes that it \\'matters\\' and its the finale and the infamous marbles episode. And by \\'matters\\' i mean that it\\'s mentioned. For example in the marbles episode: \"PLEASE I CANT DIE I HAVE ---\"\\r\\n\"SORRY I CANT HELP YOU I ALSO HAVE --- AND ---\"\\r\\nthats it\\r\\ndoes the background for the characters in THIS episode matter? Lol high hopes\\r\\ndoes the background for the overly dramatic villain matter at all? Why would it\\r\\nthe finale is the worst, the two spartans that make it out just go sicko mode in the head and just make anakong and obi-wong battle at the end without the actual emotion\\r\\nif you want to watch this episode just watch the 4th and 5th episode and skip the parts with the doctor, it doesnt matter.,The show is really entertaining because of the concept. It starts out great, maybe 9/10 through first 6 episodes. So much excitement and the concept of the games was a great idea. Then from 7th episode and on it just tanks. Bad writing, not as much suspense and boring final episode.,Awesome.VIPs tho, so dumb. Horrible voices, line delivery, and acting. Would have been better if they said nothing at all. It was like they were all doing bugs bunny impersonations. Horrible.,The only good part of it is the music played before the game being, which is stolen from Hunger Games. Including the megaphone effect.,I won\\'t give anything away, but the last 10 mins made no reasonable sense. It should have ended the way it started to after he right to the bank and not how it did after his haircut. Ep 6 is the first time is a long time I got sad watching a show. It was pretty shocking how I felt. Normally shows don\\'t make me feel sad. But overall, I loved it. Great show. It took me a few times to try and watch the first 2 Eps, but I made it to the end. Enjoy!,It is hard to understand how or why a show like this got the Green Light (pun intended). The only characters that seem believable, or even remotely interesting, are the ones that are NOT involved with the \"game\".If this is the #1 show on Netflix at the moment then I strongly suggest that someone test the water supply.,This show is probably the best example that popularity doesn\\'t equate to quality as neither the premise nor the content is new it\\'s just too many people are talking about it so it\\'s very popular as there are many shows and movies like that, for ex: Alice in borderland, As in gods will and both are japanese and another japanese movie Battle Royale, also playing a survival game doesn\\'t scream innovative as i went in with the hype just to be entertained and had no new experience.,There are some good things to say about this show: good actors, good cinematography, some good ideas.But these smokes and mirrors hide the main flow: no soul. Everything there is too engineered to feel real. When hundreds of people stand, they distribute evenly in the space. When hundreds fire, their bodies are scattered evenly in the field. When a vote is made, the distribution between Yes and No is kept evenly until the last one that looks like he just realized he needs to think about it - for suspense. The bad guys are total Nazis, the good guys are banal, similar too much to others as in the Hunger Games.This is a show engineered to make us excited, and like the players looking at the huge piggy bank we swallow it eagerly.,Boring, predictable, a bad copy of hunger games, also a stinker, and Saw...kinda liked the first one... I think.The acting is appalling, especially Gi-hun or whatever his name is whose only quality is to overcome his own stupidity when one already thinks that\\'s impossible ... I would never tire of hammering his face.It\\'s easily in the top 5 of the worst series I\\'ve ever seen. Lost 9 hours of my life to this rubbish, just to understand why people like it...even failed at that\\r\\nI prefer to sit in in a park and watch the grass grow ... much more satisfying and entertaining.,There is no deeper message here. It\\'s just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It\\'s the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we\\'ve seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop\\'s storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people.,Overrated. Over long. Tedious. I\\'ve never sat through such rubbish in my life. Seriously. I cant even think of 150 characters of review to put here. Would have made a great 90 minute movie.,That is the best way I can describe this. Once you get the concept early on, it is clear where everything is headed, but not in a way that ruins anything.There are characters you really like and some you really hate. I was good with this throughout until the last episode or two. That\\'s when both engines seem to lose power and the yellow masks drop down.I don\\'t know if they are trying to make room for a season two, but what sent this into a spiral was that some characters are so stupid they don\\'t even realize how stupid they are, even when someone tells them very clearly that they are stupid. On top of stupidity, there is this self-righteousness that is unbearable. It is amazing how oblivious people can be to their own hypocrisy.So, in summary, fun to watch but you just need a shower when it is over. One strong point is how well it nails the depths of man\\'s selfishness and human behavior in general.,First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It\\'s been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That\\'s where they hit their stride.This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn\\'t offended by it, I just felt it didn\\'t serve the story or stay authentic.I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don\\'t actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he\\'s behind it. That\\'s a fine \"twist\", but my God, his \"explanation\" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn\\'t killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It\\'s the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn\\'t as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn\\'t feeling that.And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you\\'re a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn\\'t that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I\\'m going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to \"escape\" on. I guess that\\'s another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the \"rules\" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn\\'t a huge fan of that.All in all, it was good, but could have been great.,Great acting,solid script,a fresh taste. Definitly worth watching.Really makes you wonder,is it really different in real life?There are millions of people literally dying from hunger and diarrhea. Not 465,millions. There are enough food,resource,medicine for all humankind but we don\\'t want to share or we simply don\\'t care. Like 10 richest people in the world could fed millions of people if they want to,but they don\\'t. We,people of the world,could improve the standards of life for them very easily ,but we don\\'t care. We simply don\\'t. No need to lie.So if you think this is a distopia,it\\'s not. It is reality,just more bloody or let\\'s put it this way,you have to watch them die because you have to,not like in real world.VIP acting is a mess though. ;),Squid game is a good addition to Netflix library. The Korean show is dark and gritty. The plot is fresh and exciting and it builds up nicely to the finale.The acting by the complete cast was great. There was no let up by the actors in their challenging roles.I would have loved an extra episode delving into more details such as background, more history about the game. Also felt the plot was too revealing at times.But overall a great watch.,All netflix show is over rateoverrated and overrate.,I am not one to follow the hype train usually but I just finished watching this and I have to say if you haven\\'t seen this one then you\\'re missing out! The way it grips you from the very start and doesn\\'t let go is something to be applauded. Without spoiling anything all I can talk about is how the show made me feel... it is brutal and I am not talking about the violence. Part psychological drama, part social commentary and filled with twists and turns this one is not one to miss!,It\\'s pretty unreal how shallow-minded many of the reviewers are here. They are griping about the acting. It\\'s nothing short of brilliant, and very much representative of the Korean style. If those people watched Old Boy or Parasite, they would immediately realize the strength and potency of it, and how it plays well into the dimensions of the characters and the plot threads that surround them.The sudden outbursts and taciturn restraint from the main and side characters are a mixture of subtlety and overreaching. It\\'s a delightful balance here. It\\'s also refreshing to see this instead of the atrociously mundane acting, like say in Clickbait where the actors are overly restrained so they can look attractive for the camera.This series is immensely intriguing. Listen closely for the nuances of emotion even behind the masks. Kudos to the producers and writers for being bold and for - after ten years - getting this series put onto the small screen for us to relish in with giddy delight thanks to their tenacity with Netflix.,This is a fantastic show through the 3rd episode. It is mysterious, it will tickle your sci-fi bone as well. It\\'s gory so if you aren\\'t into that pass on this. I love what Korea and Japan are producing right now!,This show has it all. The English dubbed version is a bit cheesy but it\\'s acceptable. The show itself is gory so if that\\'s not your thing don\\'t watch. It is heart wrenching. I wasn\\'t expecting this.,I would have given 9 but I am disappointed after the episode 7. Every thing was good until VIPs arrived.Slow pacing, and I got hurt when that person rejected his prize money after this struggle. Just wow🤐 All this for nothing.,Far too long for a plot that only stole some ideas from Cube or Saw. Poor acting and boring dialogues. Please avoid this one!,The show started of great, but after episode 4 it went downhill really fast. In the last episodes i was allmost confused if i was watching a Korean serie or a Mexican telenovel. Don\\'t even get me started with rhe vips. And the agent looking for his brother was a bit to obvious for me who his brother turned out to be. As well as the old man and his death. A possible great show got crinchy and predictable the last episodes.,I liked Squid Game, it\\'s refreshing to watch something of this genre besides all the overload of romcoms and other shallow programs that are offered. The camerawork, settings, acting is wonderful (minus the foreign VIPS, oh my god I really hope Korea stops casting those wannabe caucasion actors, cuz they can\\'t act even if their life depends on it, cringe level 1000!)A few minus points: the white actors (VIPS) as mentioned above. Also, the pace is really slow. And A LOT of things were very predictable. Sometimes I was just plain bored, and that isn\\'t a good thing if it\\'s a thriller/suspense genre series, right?Overall there were somewhat interesting characters and a few good moments about bonds, but still, there was something lacking. I wasn\\'t shocked or on the verge of tears when someone died or when a emotional scene happened. Also, the main character was unlikable. He showed a great ethic belief during the games, but then he didn\\'t show much growth (after the games he\\'s still a good for nothing loser).Alice in Borderland on the other hand, has more fantasy elements, but a fast pace combined with unusual turns of events that makes you really sit on the edge of your seat.Last, but not least: please watch it in the original audio (Korean) with subtitles. DON\\'T watch it dubbed. Don\\'t be lazy cuz you\\'ll have to read subtitles, because firstly, it\\'s not a big deal, and secondly, you\\'ll miss so much emotion, humor and whatnot if you watch dubbed versions (of anything, really). SUB > DUB.,I normally hate watching dubbed movies and tv but this was definitely worth it.I don\\'t know if it\\'s the story writing or the visuals but I was hooked after the 1st episode. Great show and even better if you go into it thinking the subtitles will annoy you.,Main character is completely unlikeable by the end of the story. Other than that the show is awesome with the games and side characters.,Often tough to watch but a gripping series if you can see it out.,You already know how this show is. A masterpiece. 10/10.,From the unique sets to the engaging story line, this movie had us totally engaged and hoping for a new season. Kudos to the screenwriters, actors, and set decorators.,Listen, having my eardrums busted with the hype surrounding this show I thought I\\'d give it a go! Authentic yes but there\\'s only so much bloodshed before it becomes a bore. If you\\'ve got a few hours to kill give it a shot, overrated, would not be in my top 20 series - box sets!,This series is phenomenal, cruel, big tension and a lot of sad moments. The series also reminds me of the movies called Hostel ( \"the horror ones\") but those films are like a concept if you watch Squid Game, it is like they copied your homework and made it 1000 times better.,Definitely watch this! After the first episode I was absolutely glued to the programme, I watched 5 episodes in one go, it was that good.Personally I preferred to watch it in the original language Korean with English subtitles, I believe it makes the programme much more believable.The American dubs were just awful.Fantastic acting by all. It has 2 brilliant twists at the end too!Enjoy!,I am speechless..really Awesome show. Every character development is great.mindblowing web series. Best show of the year.we need second session of this series.,If Saw met the Hunger games this would be the result, it\\'s a show that proves that the wreckless & relentless pursuit of money may not necessarily leave you with the result you desire after all is said & done.,Yes the show was super entertaining and had you engrossed, and might even go on to become Netflix\\'s most watched show, but for viewers who have seen enough cinema, there was nothing ground breaking here.The overall plot about rich people being bored so using poor people for entertainment - that\\'s been done. The final revelation the old man gave was quite cliched.What was the point of the entire sub plot with the cop looking for his brother? He turns out to be the main guard, but so what? That seemed quite a pointless chase.Half the games were quite boring to be honest.As enough people have mentioned here, the VIPs were a shocker. It was quite expected that the games were being funded by a crew of rich bored people for entertainment, but those actors and their dialogue gets a 0/10.Still, the show had great acting and fun characters, but the plot could have been WAY tighter.,Conceptually interesting and visually engaging. Horrible plot where there is no background for most things. Subpar acting. The scenes of the actual games are fun, but other than that, nothing in this lazily executed series makes sense.,The marble episode is simply gratuitous. There is no reason for it to be as drawn out as it is, and there is no reason to not simply imply instead of showing the deaths. Anyone who likes this episode is simply sadistic.Beyond that, the ending two episodes don\\'t meet what one would expect from a story. Basically, you get a cliff-hanger that is misanthropic. The old man is upset that people are killing each other and he preaches about life to the main character, yet he\\'s the force behind all of the deaths?And what about the religion that\\'s brought in? Why go after religion when it doesn\\'t matter to the plot?After the marble episode, I only finished the series because I thought there might be something upcoming to redeem the story. I was wrong to expect that kind of intelligent writing.This is a mess; don\\'t waste your time.,Enough said. (This review must contain at least one hundred and fifty characters. So I need to write more. O.k. Too much talking, not enough action. Unrealistic dialog and behaviour. There is no building on earth in which the air vents could support the full weight if a human. Stupid.,Enjoyed it. It did get boring at some points but definitely highlighted the issues in the society. It will be interesting to see what they bring out in season 2...,It\\'s nothing but something that kids who love playing gore-type, violent video games. No interesting story, just boring predictable scenes. Bad acting, cinematography is a joke. Watch it and you\\'ll easily forget it in few seconds after.,Acting, Directing, Production Design, Score, Writing we\\'re all phenomenal. I minus 0.5 because the VIP\\'s sounds so textbook and cringe.,Its amazing. Just stop reading reviews and start watching now.,When I first watched squid game, my standards weren\\'t that high. However, it exceeded my standards and is up there with my top 3 favourite TV shows.I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the interesting concept. The games were well designed and intense to watch and SOME characters you can relate with.I think Squid Game is probably near to as good as the Saw franchise.If you like Saw and survival movies, you should definitely watch, you won\\'t regret it.,Why giving rich people stupid ideas? Acting is so good, actors are very honest and Koreans are so beautiful, but the VIPs... it is so bad. Love for Wi Ha Jun.,Exciting Korean Series.My expectations were exceeded binged the season in one day..... oops! Can\\'t wait for season two.That a series on Netflix can have such a global impression.,I stayed up till 4 AM watching this one. After seeing Squid Games i will be heading into a Korean Film binge watch. What a story where the elite rule the world. Hmmm could this be another case where the bank rollershave to shows us their intent before doing so?,Like the movie parasite, the koreans have achieved fantastic ratings with mediocre productions. Everything about the squid game is mediocre to pretty good. Decent enough one time watch. Imdb ratings are so watered down these days.,I\\'m really not understanding why this show is so popular. I\\'m half way through and only one of the primary characters is likeable. The main guy gambled away his life, including his relationship with his daughter. The women are whiny and annoying. The \"rivals\" are your classic vicious bullies. The only character I\\'m really rooting for is the Pakistani. The story might be interesting if they weren\\'t all in there because of their own bad choices, but I\\'m just having a hard time getting through this series.,I have not much to say about it, it would be a waste of time.Some years ago people read fifty shades of grey thinking it was literature, now they watch this pretending it is cinematography.They were both made to amuse naives with primitive instincts.P.s. Do not watch this while eating. Actually do not watch this at all. It\\'s pointless.Edit : Having been sick with fever and stuck to bed I managed to watch through the whole series. (I guess this was the only way to go through the episodes) Having done so I\\'ll have to change my original 1-star rating to 8-star because some significant points were made later in the series, concerning human nature, which were thought provoking and I actually found interesting. Still believe that it is gross though and not suitable for the faint hearted or those that can\\'t bear the sight of blood or actually any kind of sensitive and/or sensible person. They will feel disgusted. But conclusively I don\\'t regret watching it.,Overrated!I can\\'t believe we live in a world where people can\\'t see the difference between \\'\\'quality\\'\\' and \\'\\'polished\\'\\'.This show has only one reason of being popular and it\\'s the \\'\\'memes\\'\\'. That\\'s all.Horrible acting, mediocre directing, cliche story with terrible dialogs, forced drama...When i first watched the original \\'\\'bad\\'\\' Japanese movie of \\'\\'Squid Game\\'\\', i at least had fun. It was bad but it was fun.But this is just bad all over.,The storyline is familiar. We have seen this before. From the original Battle Royale to the Hunger games, and the most recent Alice in Borderland.What makes the Squid game stand out is definitely the character development of the main characters. You got to know them, you hate them, you feel sorry for them, you love them;+ Great acting from the actors and actresses.+ I like the games, not complicated but simple recognizable games.+ different from others we got an undercover police man in the staff of the game. This was refreshing to see the other side and not only focusing on the characters in the game. And the guy who is playing the undercover is an eyecandy to watch.Less enthusiastic about:\\r\\nsome predictable plots, like the main character will survive till the end.somehow I knew the frontman was the brother of the undercover police man, but why and how did he end up as the frontman?-the VIPS, please delete their part. Terrible fake acting.the final episode, of course they finish with the squid game, but It was not so excited like the previous games. Also towards the end was disappointing.Fun fact\\r\\nThe main character resembles Hong Kong actor Sean Tam.,Starts slow, then you get the shock. Acting is so bad its beyond corny. Lots of shock and blood.So, even tho it\\'s not a great film or story, once you start, you have to finish to see who wins!Spoiler alert! At the end there are some surprises!,This series would deserve a solid 9, except for the fact that\\'s it contains 3 pathetic and unacceptable flaws.As high-caliber that each episode and the storyline was, it went majorly downhill in Episode 7 with the portrayal of the VIPs. The show\\'s portrayal of idiotic Americans takes the viewer right down to an uncomfortable level at how ridiculously these characters were expected to be. Even if they were attempting to make them seem stupid, it made the show pretty cringe-worthy from how well it had developed up until that point. It quickly went downhill at the introduction of these characters.Finally, the ending of the final \"game\" played in the show was really dumb and lacked redemption in the characters\\' development. As well as, the ending of the film and it\\'s dialogue leading up to it.I was going to knock off 3 points for the above 3 mentioned failures, but wanted to be generous with a final rating if 7 (reduced from what could have been a 9, had they not messed up this show so badly). Overall, the show was excellent - until it was not - with its horrible conclusion.As good as this show was for most of it, the ending completely destroyed it, making me wonder \"What was the point of watching this?\" It is unbelievable that a show that was written and acted so well, turned into something sloppy at the end that could have been written much better. It\\'s as if someone different who had no idea what the story was, wrote the final episode.I recommend watching it for 85% of the show. If you\\'re not attached to having a properly explainable and redemptive ending, then you may love the whole thing.,It was an awesome series, multiple games, thrill, suspense, violence..\\r\\nCredit goes to cinematic editor.The old man story was awesome. It would be better if at the end there should be clip of daughter of main character ( Hero ),Stays true to the high production standards that Korean film and TV have been producing in the last 20 odd years. Engaging narrative which is both simple enough for a mass audience, yet intriguing enough to keep the diehards guessing. 8/10.,I got caught in the gushing for this series so couldn\\'t wait to watch it.Bitterly disappointed to be honest, so many plot holes that really distract from a good if not great premise.The ending is incredibly poor I won\\'t say more as I don\\'t want to spoil it for you but honestly don\\'t get your hopes up.,Just read most of reviews. Most of users like VIPs, criticising last 3 episode and providing bad rating.Ok VIP\\'s dialogues and acting are pathetic but you can not deny Squid Game has fantastic story with suspense and screenplay. So don\\'t think like that and you should not provide rating below 7. It started well and middle of suspense also enough to stick with show.Those people who are expecting more then they just like VIPs and they don\\'t have satisfaction and fun in their\\'s life. Whatever you provide they always say \\'no this is not enough\\'.Mark my word those users also want to organize kind of this game and find some fun ... ha ha ha.,Except for the VIPs acting and their embarrassing \"jokes\" - coughs *69,96* - Squid Game is one of the best shows ever being perfectly engaging and exciting.,This is so overhyped its untrue. 4/10Here\\'s the reality, without spoilers (not that there us that much to spoil). This is just so derivative of other series, be they far eastern or western and so there really was very little original to talk about. Its basically just a gore fest with the excuse that its an anti capitalist message... yawn, done before and far better in many other productions. I really dont get what others are seeing that is original about it.This inevitably leads to there being something else needed to pull through and that typically means great characters or great effects. Sadly this really fails on the latter and doesnt really deliver on the former either,I have no issues with anti heros but if you have a full cast of them, then you\\'ve really gotta work saving graces in. There were ok, a couple of characters that werent completely abhorrent.I didnt find the acting particularly convincing from any of them, completely overdramatized interactions were the norm. That however could be as much the direction as the actor/actress.Also dont get me started on the sexism etc in this. I get annoyed at Holywood for the long term fad of trying to remove any masculinity from all things to the point of absurdity but that doesn\\'t excuse things in the other direction, the chauvinism not just expressed by characters (which would be ok to a certain degree) but then underpinned by events in the show is just unacceptable and cost this show 2 stars in and if itself.Overall, I watched it through just to see where it went and it just remained pretty poor. I doubt I will bother with season 2, whatever the hype.,Laughable acting and hilarious dialogue(in an unintentionally bad way), add English dubbing to this and you get Squid Game.The over use of violence just makes it even more dumber, there is absolutely nothing realistic in this movie, even Purge made more sense.Not sure how this gets such high ratings, Ed Wood has made better movies.,\"Squid game\" is a Korean mystery/thriller tv-series about a group of people selected to participate in a sinister game of survival.Every participant is selected because they are out of luck and in debt, and desperate enough to do what it takes to escape their fate in the outside world.We follow deadbeat dad and gambling addict Seong Gi-Hun, as he continue to fall into bottomless debt, and after a fateful late night gamble at the subway, gets an invitation to a final game where everything will change.What follows is a series of games, where the stakes are final if you lose, but the price is a chance to redeem yourself financially and for some, morally.The show is really nothing more, or less, than a solid script, with no forced finger pointing or animosity based on race or sex. There are assholes and villains, and there are good people, and people in between. Regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. There\\'s no bigotry outside of that, which U. S. TV-shows are unable to write or make anymore.It\\'s exciting, but there is a certain amount of over-acting and a bit of melodrama that can be somewhat grating to a western palate, but when the script is that good and engaging, it\\'s easy enough to stomach. Other than the aforemented, the actors do a stellar job.It has some flaws of course. It\\'s not groundbreaking or terribly original in it\\'s constituant parts, but as a whole, it works perfectly fine for what it is.It\\'s well shot, well paced, engaging, but with some overplaying that draws you out of the story a bit, as mentioned. Overall an enjoyable, exciting and somewhat gory and bloody good series, with added societal criticism and a message that doesn\\'t label any specific demographic as inherently evil.,I loved the first 7 episodes which were fun and the acting was good till the last episode which was poorly written but you must watch this show. You will engage with my the main characters and the way the games are designed make them fun to watch.,This creative new show, which has clearly been inspired by Karl Marx\\'s genius work \\'Das Capital\\', provides an up to date analysis of capitalism and its billions of victims.Hopefully it stays on track and doesn\\'t fall victim to the very thing that it\\'s critiquing.,Well first of all, this is not a good show in any way.Stealing the concept from hunger games as one example.The acting is beyond bad.. So so bad.I recommend watching the japanese movie Battle royal instead. Thats the original with good story and good acting.,It is very average and doesn\\'t deserve all that hype. I\\'m sorry.😢😢\\r\\nThe first 3 episodes where engaging especially the first one. It went downhill from there.,Loved every episode. Give it a chance. Definitely not the same ol crud that gets pumped out over and over these days.,Incredibly original and risky tv and not for the faint hearted. Dark, outrageous and ridiculously addictive. The only annoying thing was the terrible acting from the VIP Western actors. A real oversight on the casting but apart from that a great rollercoaster ride.,Soo, in 2021 you want to make a tv show that will be seen all over the world. And you can do anything, be really creative. BUT, you decide to steal the trade mark of one of the biggest netflix shows of all time.Even if you didn\\'t see, la casa de papel. You know their red suit and mask.Why would you do that? Even if the show turns out to be amazing, it\\'s so emberassing. They don\\'t feel ashamed? It\\'s a joke.,The idea of the show is interesting, but overall is really boring. I had to skip more than half of the show...\\r\\nThere are so weird things, like the actor who speaks with food in his mouth 20 minutes and he is not chewing the food. It\\'s really disgusting.In general, the acting was really bad. Exagerated. Theatrical. I know that in asia this is kinda normal, but you can\\'t take it seriously.And the most important thing. Why would you copy the famous trade mark of la casa de papel? They have almost the same jumpsuit, the guns and of course they have masks too. Embarrassing.Korean Hunger Games in La casa de papel costum. Copy-cat. \"Veeery creative\". Pathetic.,This korean series is okay. It has pretty nice set designs and good cinematography. However the acting could definitely be stronger. The music is often pretty good, although some choices I personally found kinda odd. The story itself is nothing special and has been told in better and different ways.,2 episodes in and already hooked. It has basic concept that we have seen in other movies but Koreans know how to write unlike western writers. Characters get flushed out and you actually care about them. Acting is also really good (non of that cringy western actors). If you like well written thrillers definitely check this one out.,Just read a review from a Korean speaker who says the translation of the dialogue is poor to say the least. That was one of biggest problems with this show. The English dialogue is awful. Painful.The acting is ok but there does tend to be a lot of stage, exaggerated acting in front of the camera. It is over the top. In particular from one of the central, female characters. The \"baddie\" just does stereotypical baddie.Central story is fine. Interesting at times. Sets are very good. Didn\\'t like the ending. Don\\'t why the writer thought that would be a better ending than just the winner\\'s game comes to an end and then he witnesses the beginning of the next one.An alright show in my opinion but don\\'t understand the hype.,This TV series is so good I think mainly because it is relatable. I believe anyone who watches this will unconsciously put themselves in the situation of the players in the game. One of the reason it is also relatable is because the personalities of each character is different, consequently their approach to the game. Apart from that, mostly the emotions from watching this series will make you engage at every moment making you hooked at it.,Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute. Squid Game has many interesting and unique elements trough out the show while showcasing our present reality and how cruel it may be, with a decent written script and great acting. The only cons about the show is defiently the VIP\\'s acting and the ending. Would recommend.,Whatever the many other virtues of this series, the violence and dwelling on blood and gore undermine it. I find it odd that squeamishness about showing physical love and nakedness can sit alongside a celebration of physical conflict, pain and injury.,This show is very well done, the set design is absolutely stunning, the actors (main ones) are pretty good, the character development is great as well. Some great emotional moments throughout. Awesome practical effects as well. The only gripe I have with it is the addition of other certain characters (episode 7) that are just awfully done. Awful acting (can barely read their lines right), and some cringy dialogue from those characters. They also tried to make them comedic, which was totally out of the blue and weird. They reuse the same song over and over for most of the series. And for the love of god, stop making Korean actors speak English. It\\'s extremely hard to act in your second language, and you can tell some of the actors have never said a word in English. It really takes you out of the immersion. Overall, it\\'s a really good show and worth a watch 100%.,Although there were logic errors and nonsense, the series was very gripping and did not lose its grip by making it interesting until the end. It was a quality production in general, but the ending was so unnecessary and ridiculous. Despite its shortcomings, it is an impressive series with its characters, drama and reaction. Especially the first game, \"red light, green light\", terrified the audience beautifully and reflected the traumaticity and drama, which is the theme of the series. Also, the series has been the voice of people suffering from economic difficulties. The things I love about the show are the characters, the good portrayal of emotions in the scenes, and the beautiful creative plot. So i love this show in general, i can give from 7,5/10 to 8/10. By the way, those VIP guys acting were sucks dude, i felt so cringe when they talk.. but in general, they all were good actors and actresses i think.,Just binged watched 4 episodes in a row. Amazing!Extraordinarily original and fresh. There are some feelings of Old Boy, Parasite and Japan\\'s Battle Royale, and of course hints of Black Mirror (the title graphics make that very clear) - but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.It\\'s best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.I see a few here complaining about VIP acting, I have no clue what that is, but I found the acting overall very good.I don\\'t speak Korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.Since it\\'s mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.Let\\'s face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average SAW-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. Subtle messaging abounds. For your consideration.The design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful Escher and Minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.With Star Wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. Under a hierarchy based on shapes and a Vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.And that\\'s where the Old Boy feeling really kicks in. Is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?Overall, I would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you\\'ve found something you will absolutely love.Can\\'t really say any more until I\\'m done watching it all.But I\\'m going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.Or it should be. Especially given the work gone into this.Thanks for reading.,I knew who is who by the 3-4. Episode, but good characters and story. Exciting, thrilling, brutal, sensitive.,I was hesitant to watch it at first because of all the hype surrounding it. But I gave in in the end and I\\'m so glad I did. Binge-worthy series. Original plot and highly entertaining. I was happy to rewatch it with my partner who was late to the party. Minus 1 star for the horrible acting from the VIPs. But it\\'s ok, they\\'re hardly in it and so thankful for that. The rest of the actors were great! The old man/ player #1 was my favourite and his character brought so much to the story. Great character development and story in general.,The main ideas of the series is what money can buy in this world, what makes your life worth living, what is the cost of a human life. That is by itself a very good bunch of thesises to build up. But when I was watching this show, I always felt that person that was developing characters isn\\'t suited for it at all. All the characters are very generic and cliched. At some point you could cling to them, feel some connection, root for them, the next minute you already feel sick of seeing them as they are being ruined for the sake moving the plot further. This is a typical battle-royal where you know that this exact character could die because he isn\\'t written well enough and haven\\'t got any screentime, but that other dude will certainly die because he\\'s on your screen just because they need people for this kind of story.Having said that, there are still plenty of good moments (i.e. Episode \"Gganbu\" was really dramatic and this is great considering what I said above), very good quality of filming, interior of the scenes, costumes. Overall, this series is worth to watch, but beware of annoying stupidly written dialogues and poorly realised character progression. If you\\'re okay with synopsis - go watch it! But that\\'s not really any kind of masterpiece.,A great narrative/concept which thrills the life out of any audience member. Despite Gi Sung being the primary protagonist there was always doubt in him due to the incompetence he had previously displayed. I genuinely thought Sang Woo would win as he showcased what a \\'normal\\' person would do to live yet still related to us early on. In the games you would want to be Sang Woo, he is the most intelligent and is physically capable of passing the games and so you try to defend his choices until they devour you, similarly seen before with Walter White.However i do have a few issues with Squid Game.1. So the old man was behind it but wanted to get the thrill of playing. I jokingly guessed this as it seemed quite ridiculous. In the tug of war game he was inches away from dying but in the marble game where he actually lost, he lived anyway so the \"thrill\" he was talking about mustve been pretty pointless if he still had control.2. The detective sub plot is intriguing but the reveal is obvious and well... we don\\'t exactly get closure as hes shot in the shoulder, oh... and he fell in water. He\\'ll be perfectly fine for season 2 then.3. Gi Sung goes back to the games, abandoning his daughter and his character arc completion because he wants to know whos behind it? I thought we had concluded that it were just rich sociopaths who had no faith in humanity. I dont see how Gi Sung can gain anything from going back other than a 2nd season.I could praise the show for a while as the positives largely outweigh the negatives, i just thought i\\'d support the devil\\'s advocate by asking questions that were being overlooked.8/10 Superb acting (the VIP\\'s excluded), plot not as deep as you think.,I wasn\\'t experting a lot from this series, because movies/series that are this hyped are not usually the best. But this was great!! First of al the idea was awsome and the achting was exeptional, exept for the awful VIP\\'s (but i loved the masks they where wearing) The set design is som of the best i have ever seen in any movie/series. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 9 is the ending. I won\\'t go into it, but it is not at all what i was hoping for. I also love that Netflix is investing in foreign cinema, and the risk that they took was absolutely worth it!So i absolutely recomend this te everyone who can handle a little blood.PS: sorry for the bad english, I\\'m dutch so you know.....,The games are somewhat interesting and the overall premise has some intrigue, but it lacks more than it gives. Poor acting, massive plot holes and a twist that\\'s really average are ignored for mass carnage entertainment. I mean I get it - we all wanted to be entertained, even if it\\'s poorly put together. The best kind of soup for the brain.,Overrated show , I do not understand how people like it , I mean the idea is so cliché and the acting was one of the worst , Netflix tries its best to find a series to defeat HBO or ABC but they can not.,I haven\\'t read any reviews yet but I don\\'t have to for this one. This was a little slow to pick up, cliché, predicable, has some spotty acting, and I didn\\'t like the progression of the games or the last episode. Those are all my nitpicks and even with those, I still feel like I have to give this a ten.So, why the ten? This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments. I\\'ll keep it short. If the trailer interested you, you probably won\\'t be disappointed.\"Everyone is equal here\" \"You think money can fix everything\"?,Squid Game: it\\'s everywhere. It is almost inescapable at this point. There are countless memes on social media and hilarious news articles. I was hesitant to check this out when people told me to watch it. Many times the most popular pieces of art pander to the lowest common denominator. And, to be honest, Squid Game does this frequently but it is a hell of a ride and there are thick layers of food for thought hidden underneath.This is by no means a perfect show or a masterpiece so let\\'s begin by getting my complaints out of the way. Firstly, this show spells so much out for the audience to an insulting point but I understand why. Squid Game is a Netflix original and is by no means a foreign gem, such as the likes of Harikari or Departures. This was clearly written and directed in a way so that even the most simple minded audience can enjoy the story. Surprisingly, it\\'s not that big of a deal. It works in a similar way to Disneyworld: there are the joyrides, concessions, and Mickey Mouse for the kiddies and while adults love that stuff too, they also have a bar for the adults.One example of the aforementioned pandering are the God awful flashbacks. When Gi-hun learns that his daughter is moving to the United States with her stepfather and mother, we are given a flashback to the dinner sequence where this fact was pretty obviously hinted at that happened only a few moments prior. I mean come on. How stupid do they think their audience is (a rhetorical question of course)? We also have the front man\\'s reveal, which could have easily been left a mystery. I mean, I guessed that even before the cop found out his brother had been a contestant but I\\'m sure that Star Wars-Luke, I am your father-reveal worked for the general audience. But let\\'s not lie to ourselves, that was hilariously corny. I laughed my ass of during that scene.Which leads to my second complaint: the predictability but, again, it doesn\\'t detract much from the plot. Aside from the reveal that the old man was the master at the end, most of the M. Night Shyamalan \"twists\" can be seen coming a mile away.With that said, there\\'s really not a lot to complain about here. Squid Game is addicting. I watched the show by myself in two sittings (it would have been one if I did not have to wake up early to register my car) and then I watched a good chunk of the show again with my mom, and I already want to watch the show again. Why? Two reasons: It is addictingly thrilling and there are actually some well hidden hints and Easter eggs scattered throughout.So while it does pander, it left me with a lot to think about. The games as a whole are somewhat of a representation of capitalism, which is not some pretentious high school theory, the director has said the show represents the class inequality in Korea. Think about it, here we have 455 disenfranchised individuals who are willing to risk their lives and kill others for money, many without a second thought. They even offer the players the chance to leave if the majority vote in favor of such a decision. This is a genius mechanism that I will get back to in a second. So the players are caged animals here. Behind the scenes, we have psychopathic aristocrats laughing there ass off and placing bets. Don\\'t you think some rich asshole funded this movie? The premise of this movie is not that different from life in these so called \"democratic\" nations. We slave away at jobs that pay next to nothing and if at any moment we, let\\'s say, need a surgery, we will be in debt for a good portion of the rest of our lives. We are basically the contestants in this show and the higher ups at the corporations we work at are the VIPS.This brings me back to the voting system. The players cannot stop playing the game but they can leave if the majority vote in favor of quitting. We can\\'t stop working or we will become homeless and die. But we can vote to tax the rich or increase the minimum wage, yet most of us are so enslaved to capitalism that we would write that off as communism because we aspire to become the next Elon Musk (think about how many college aged white dudes love Elon Musk. They worship a man who has enough to feed his entire country).Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. I got political. It\\'s a touchy subject but it\\'s true and Squid Game is unafraid to speak out on it in a pretty haunting way.Anyway, I don\\'t really need to recommend this show to anyone. You\\'re most likely going to get sick of hearing about it and watch it like I did. Many of the obvious aspects of the show have already been talked about so I wanted to take a few moments to discuss some things the average viewer probably did not consider. It\\'s obviously a great show and you will probably see it.,I started watching this show with some doubts. But after just 30 minutes I was invested in the storyline and could not stop watching. I could certainly it\\'s the best show I have watched in a while. Great original storyline and talented actors!,Watch one Episode you have seen it all.This is nothing special, and so predictable, definitive a no brainer nothing more.,I watched this show a few weeks ago, I was very skeptical and honestly was over everyone over hyping it lol like I did plan to watch it but like eventually I wasn\\'t in a rush but once I did I was like I should have watched it sooner.First of all, I think the point of this show is to prove how greedy people have become. How they would rather see everyone die at the chance of only one person surviving with all that money. Though the chance of them ending with the money was very slim. They did a such a great job at showing the intensity, the suspense, the plot twists. I loved the plot twist of the old man being behind it of it all. It was unpredictable, a lot of shows now a days can be very predictable but this show was just so incredible. The actors did a such a great job at expressing what their characters were feeling. There was so much expression on their faces at every scene to the point where the audience could feel their pain. I have to admit it made me tear up. This show was very gory, but anyone could learn a lot from it psychologically. It was truly, a great refreshing idea. Unlike any other show I\\'ve seen, I cannot wait for season 4!,Acting is so bad almost hard to believe these are some actors.My elementary and middle school kids saying everyone in school talks about it, so is this for soon to be teenage audience? No too much violence yet American kids are watching it like mcdonal of tv shows.,I had the privilige to watch this show before it blew up, so I didn\\'t expect too much. Squid Game is suspenseful and comes with a great metaphore, but at the same time doesn\\'t offer anything new, we have seen it all before and that with better acting, better twists and better writing, so I\\'m a bit surprised by the rating.At the end of the day it is enjoyable to watch, but do not expect this show to be anything more than a pastime, sorry to the fans.,It is a show based on Human Psychology, Emotions, Greed, Love, Respect and so many other things combined together. A brilliant story and a Must Watch.,Great show but....\\r\\nstart at 9 star but gradually ends with 2 star. With very lame ending. I am unimpressed with the message the creator intend to show..,This wasn\\'t something that I would have picked on my own but when my boyfriend suggested it became something that I had trouble waiting for him. Dubbing takes a little to get use to but definitely worth watching.,This show had a great story! I thought the game rooms were the best part and made show come alive. The only thing that was annoying was the voice/dubbed dialog. Also, really liked the characters. Season 2 should be more about the games cause main guy is definitely going back in.,4stars. Hardly!I had high expectations before watching Squid Games... but it let me down.I am a fan of foreign and independent productions, never had the chance to watch from South Korea though.It starts off pretty well, but fails to keep the flame up with each following episode...\\r\\nNo spoilers ahead!In my humble opinion, if I want to rate the series in different aspects it will be as follows - the points are over 10.1- Acting: mediocre - 2\\r\\n2- Story line: too predictable and highly unnecessary scenes - 4\\r\\n3- cinematography: nothing new - 3\\r\\n4- Music : boring -2\\r\\n5- Length: Horribly long and boring durations of episodes (my wife and I usually do not use our smart phones while we watch a series... unfortunately we were constantly checking our phones...) - 3\\r\\n6- Concept: very nice and new but with bad execution - 5\\r\\n7- Production: average - 5\\r\\n8-Ending: it does not end... please roll the credits!!! But you still watch... hehe! - 2 (and the red hair was a total turn off)\\r\\n9- message: at least horses don\\'t violently die in betting games.,Compelling, iam have way thru didn\\'t got boring once so far. Nice designs, graphics and characters. Worth the watch for sure.,Found it formulaic & predictable. Not sure why this is popular & apparently trending. I found it shallow & storylines full of holes. I liked the \"North Korean\" character Kang Sae; wish they had done more with her character. Jun ho was just a loser who drifted along & had zero redeeming qualities.My opinions.,It started out promising; I thought it would be a different touch to the topics that we have already seen in other movies: hunger games, the game, maze, the exam etc. But it never got to the point where all the violence makes sense. Characters do not make sense, scenario do not build up to something meaningful. All that mysterious show-business-kind-of costumes and staging lose their effect when the plot is unable to deliver a meaningful explanation. In each episode until the last scene, I expected a twist or some progress so that I could appreciate all the hype but nope. It did not happen. If the message was injustice and humans gotta make their way with it, that\\'s been done countless times and sorry, this didn\\'t sell it.,This show is absolutely terrible, and the acting is shockingly crap, it\\'s like rewatching the old Monkey series.Pretty crap for this day and age.Crap characters and crap show.,But the main takeaway from this series is never trust an old man. Besides that, there are lot of bad human habits exposed of course, and also unexpected situations that made this a solid nine for me, some things could have been better (i.e. The main character old friend is way too sadistic in most of the cases) but is truly a footage of the human being in the world.,I found the show hard to sit through. It was uncomfortable and brutal. Sometimes the show moved slowly. Overall there are many deep lessons and over arching themes about classism in the writing. The acting is phenomenal. I appreciate the philosophical aspects of the show. It is another level of sophistication compared to your typical American drama.,A deeply poignant show that superbly builds its critique of our current economic system and the despair and utter desperation that it drives people to, particularly in the second episode. The acting is powerful and the characters also possess strong identities so you quickly come to see them as people.Unfortunately, the show peaks in the sixth episode, which was phenomenal and some of the best television I have seen. From then on, however, the quality declines, important subplots are left with no resolution, and the ending was erratic and dissatisfying: for example, it does not touch on previous themes of democracy and equality in the process.It feels as though the original script was heavily edited so as to allow a second season, and therefore make more money. Ironic in a critique of capitalism, but there you are.Overall, still worth watching.,It used to make me cringe. But I\\'m not gonna watch this in the original language. English is already my second language. Hating substitles was the reason i learnt English before school to begin with.,An absolute gem from South Korea. Amazing show from the first ep. To the last one. A must see...,Once again another overrated Korean series.. It was ok to watch but never worth what it was hyped for , Like how Parasite was never an Oscar winning movie.,I haven\\'t enjoyed a first season like this since Westworld and can\\'t recommend this enough. Was a little bit jarring at first but really merged a lot of genres that had never been done before and knocked it out of the ballpark. A+,I read a short story \\'The Most Dangerous Game\\' in high school with basically the same plot, but not sci-fi with special effects. I found the Squid Game super boring and just about every plot point was predictable. I think the average Superman comic book has more interesting twists than this overblown, stretched out story. It was a disappointment since there are a lot of Asian movies and series that have really interesting stories with characters that are more complex than video game ones. But if you like video games, there\\'s a good chance you will like this movie, except that you have no control over the story. Now, if the producers could get the audience involved in determining the fate of the games, that could be interesting. As it is, it\\'s hardly worth spending time writing about it (unless you\\'re getting paid) and I\"m not.,Curiosity got the best of us and we decided to give it a try and see what the general craze is all about. Watched it to the end, at some point just to get it over with, although it\\'s pretty predictable, most of the actors are talentless and some almost deplorable. Voice over in English kind of helped a little - I don\\'t think we could have watched it in Korean. Those who read Richard Bachman\\'s \"Running man\" (Stephen King\\'s alias) may have recognized the general idea of a deadly game played by desperate paupers in a distopian society - so nothing new here, right? However, Bachman\\'s characters are likable, relatable and dignified in spite of their humility. Squid game\\'s characters are greedy, vicious, non relatable and it\\'s really hard to make a connection with them or feel anything - viewer sees them just like the glass chess-like pieces in one of the last games. Being unable to identify the characters by name doesn\\'t help either. I won\\'t even get into details about the level of violence - gory and unnecessary. So, why the craze? Beats me.,Very well made series. They have done an exceptional job here with Netflix money. Definitely recommend.,Don\\'t waste your time on this pathetic series. You would be better off watching paint dry. Again Netflix produces more garbage entertainment. Gratuitous violence. Stupid plot. Unbearable acting.,Execution 9/10Substance 5/10Also very, very boring more than half the time.Was forced to watch this because my wife wanted to watch it.Can honestly say I want my eight hours back.Skip.,Lot of the things in the story line don\\'t make sense and situations happen abruptly without any context. Characters behavior are not consistent. There are no cliffhanger movements. Simply overrated and lot of hype.,(Contains mild spoiler)\\r\\nWhat an amazing show! Korean drama of this type is so different and well done. So unique in every element - the set, filmography, costumes, plot, acting, emotion - all was just to the point.Aesthetic in a creepy way, emotional (I got all teary on the Gganbu episode), it also had so many life lessons that touched on so many aspects of life. The players there got me thinking about the fine line between good and bad. Another thing is that in comparison to the other actors, VIPs seemed to be more relaxed and preposterous as I was expecting them to be scary and serious. But that\\'s the charm, I guess no one will be expecting those VIPs to be some old bored rich bummers.Adults playing kids games with their life at stake. Despite all those horrors that were shown in this drama, the rewatch value is 10 on 10.1 star down cause it didn\\'t answer all the questions and I hope there will be a second season that I\\'ll be waiting for.,Squid Games realisesThat even closest ppl will ditch/kill , when they want to become billioner or go ahead from you in life/career .Billioner thinks common man are like horse to whom we can do gambling & make \"FUN\" by using them .Many ppl will do buttering/use you when they need something , but same ppl will throw you OUT they have same power in thier hands.,Super letdown after all the excitement in the first 7 episodes. The last 2 episodes are pretty boring, especially the ending which is just plain silly! Overall, still good and worth watching.,I watched the whole season and though it was mediocre, I know a lot of people like it but I felt like some of the chapters were shallow and pretty much as a hole thought it was boring( I mean there might be some bias as I seen movies and some shows that are very similar),Story keeps you captivating. Its little predictable but its great watch.,The English parts of this show are just horrible. The vip acting is horrible. This should would be better if the vips were voiced over with Korean. The Korean actors had a better understanding of how English sounds..., Never dull...but do NOT let your kids watch this one!\\r\\n, A new TV classic\\r\\n, Just a game\\r\\n, \"We\\'re in hell here.

Wish it was 100% in Korean.\\r\\n,Se-Jeong Kim does another great drama-and the other cast are ace too\\r\\nfunny and heart warming drama-keeps us happy unto if/when uncanny counters 2 is done.,Just watch it. I have been struggling to find a new kdrama from many months after hometown cha cha cha got over. My search is over. Found my new favourite gem.Reasons: What worked1) Both actors and actresses looks perfect for their role. Age wise as well as attractive wise.2) Fast paced and 90% of the screen time is devoted to main couples.3) It\\'s funny and entertaining. Yeah, I can\\'t remember last time seeing a romantic show with funny lines and lots of funny scenes Finally, Kdrama is getting the humor right.4) Very likable side couple and their story so far.5) And the most important thing in the show :- Story and Romance. It clicks. It clicks from very first moment in the show. The chemistry between them makes you feel involve in the show from very first episode.🇰🇷 You don\\'t have to wait for second and third episodes for it. And I have seen lots of Kdramas in the past and there are very few shows who manages to do that. It gets your attention and the next thing you know is that you are addicted. You just can\\'t stop watching.6) Message to the director, writer and producer. Thank you for bringing this show on netflix. The feeling one gets from watching a romantic kdrama is something out of this world. Its a special feeling you get when you are in love. You guys are doing God work by spreading happiness and love across the world. Keep doing it. I love it. The whole World loves it. Thank you. Thank you.,I love this drama as it is my favourite office romance genre. But the thing is they kept this show very subtle. They didnt exaggerate and that would have been boring to watch. So yes there are cliches but with realistic touch. I love it and the cast is so amazing. All the four leads are very good. I am loving Kim Se Jeong\\'s acting as it is the first time I am watching her. And Obviously, Ahn Hyo Seop is a gift to the eyes in this series and also his character is smooth unlike rude boses.,I can\\'t get enough of The Office Blind Date (A Business Proposal in the US on Netflix). It is the most hysterical corporate K-drama I have ever watched and just finished Episode 3 and 4. I couldn\\'t stop laughing for practically any moment, and that says a lot because not much makes me laugh. It is a good thing that I have to wait another week for Episode 5 because I don\\'t think I could stand that much laughter in one day. I love the leading male, Aho Hyo-Seop as Kang Tae Mu and also the leading female Se-Jeong Kim as Shin Ha Ri. I very rarely mention a female star so that says a lot about Se-Jeong Kim; she brings so much to the show.,This is laugh out loud funny and charming right from the 1st episode. The characters are so well cast, story lines and writing is hilarious and the cliches are self-aware and poke fun at themselves. I\\'ve shared this with so many people who don\\'t usually watch kdramas and they are also loving it.,No idea why I can\\'t stop watching I don\\'t even speak Korean I finish at 4 ep and mad they don\\'t have more ugh. It\\'s funny seeing her almost getting caught every time love the comedy wish it was dubs because I can\\'t 100 percent be focus when I\\'m always reading.,There are so many funny lines and humorous situations in the storyline that I\\'m constantly smiling and laughing. The leads are sexy and adorable the entire cast is talented and hilarious. They deliver fast paced dialogue with great comedic timing. The music, editing and effects make everything even better. I highly recommend this show!,The storyline and plot is really good, with judicious application of popular tropes. I love how every single character on the show has been fleshed out really well. The Main couple and second couple are both hilarious and lovable. I usually can\\'t stand kdramas, and dont watch them, but I wait for this show every week with a lot of anticipation. Props to the producers, writers and the actors of this show!,If you searching for some comedy romance genre this drama would be a perfect choice for it has a beautiful story and the whole cast is fabulous! I loved every minute!! Very meaningful and healing. It\\'s funny and worth watching for sure! I am Loving it!!,It\\'s quite cool how they first met and fell for eachother quite exquisite and it tells even if you are an Elite Business man, you have heart and time to give it to right person.,Watched 8th ep today felt very happy for kang tae moo business proposal is such a brilliant masterpiece and i would like to give it a 10 coz it deserves it.,A superb series great cast, chemistry, acting, direction and scripting. It just works so well could not stop watching it. I have not laughed this much in a long time.,Love this drama one of the best dramas... I love all the characters\\' acting skills is soooo good 👍 ..... I have watched till ep 6 and it was soo good full of entertainment. Waiting for the new episode hope the further episodes will be the same. Love it soo much everyone should watch it 🤗. If you have not watched the drama yet please go and watch.....Only this doesn\\'t make any senseThat a person becomes unrecognisable just by putting on a wig and makeup on her face and her wig doesn\\'t even look different from her real hair she looks same with or without makeup and she also behaves the same... and her attitude, voice all are same... I know it is a drama but they should have done betterApart from this, I love this drama 🎭 ......worth watching ⌚,I loveee this drama it\\'s comedy and funny and the actors looks beautiful eww hahaha <3\\r\\nI think this story doesn\\'t have any bored scene and such an amazing drama.,It\\'s been a while for me to have such an emotional drive-through KDrama. The series includes all of my favorite actors, acting is so on point and full of chemistry and so beyond a big raise for Sejeong to be the lead in the drama. She now has the chance to prove herself an amazing actress. Another big thumb up is for the screenwriter performing an absolutely hyping and charming storytelling.,Many dialogues and scenes are copied exactly from the kdrama - What\\'s wrong with secretary Kim. This is plagiarism at best and I don\\'t think Ahn Yo Seop is that good looking to suit the role and doesn\\'t even deserve to be compared with Park Seo Jun in that sense .,This drama is really fun! I can\\'t help but smile and laugh because of the chemistry & dialogs of the casts. Keep up the good work. This drama made we can\\'t wait for Mondays to come, lol.,I just watched the first two episodes of this drama and I am already loving it. It is the perfect romantic comedy series to watch when you just want to chill and have fun.So far these are the things that I like about the series:\\r\\ngreat chemistry between Tae-mu and Ha-rithe second leads look really good togetherthe friendship between Ha-ri and Young-seoi like that everything looks bright and cheery, the even add some graphics that add a comical dimension to the overall effectsince the leads work in F&B industry the food looks sooo good I immediately crave Korean takeout, in fact i really did go out to order a bibimbap bowl in a local korean restaurantI like Tae-mu\\'s grandfather who is obsessed with watching his daytime dramas in the officeI cannot wait for the next episodes in the coming weeks! Glad that this is only a 12-part series and such a joy to watch. Hope it doesn\\'t disappoint until the end.,I love this drama! I think it is one of the funniest K-dramas I have watched so far. After watching so many serious dramas with action and mind boggling plot twists, I was in the mood for something light hearted and stumbled across this on netflix. If you are looking for something less serious and want to laugh this is the one to watch.,Whoa\\r\\nThis drama is really loaded and well directed\\r\\nI mean the suspense is just right\\r\\nThe series just started but in just 4 episodes it has a lot to offer\\r\\nI wonder what\\'s going to be served to us in the episodes to come\\r\\nI can\\'t wait for next week.,This is the one of the funniest romance k drama I have ever seen in my whole life just fabulous the chemestry between the characters is awesome loved it watching from my heart.,Been a while didn\\'t pick up an Kdrama, probably 2 years. I was feeling low and burn out bcs of work, searching for a romcok dramas just to escape the reality once in a while. Then, stumble upon this romcom and it becomes my go-to relaxing content to consume everyday. The chemistry of the cast is so awesome that makes me cannot resist. The story lines are so funny yet some stories just so relatable. I rewatch the drama almost everyday, sometime just some cuts but it s like a chill pill for me. It does lift me up and make me feel cheerful. This drama is must watch for those who are searching for light-hearted, entertaining movie to release some stress. The casts are so energetic, talent and genuine that make me cannot stop watching it., superb\\r\\n, Got me hooked from very first episode.\\r\\n, Heart Fluttering Drama after a long long time.\\r\\n, Most Hysterical Corporate K-Drama Ever!\\r\\n, Funniest show I\\'ve ever watched\\r\\n, So addictive\\r\\n, Hilarious\\r\\n, Really good\\r\\n, Heartwarming and entertaining\\r\\n, Smooth and Exquisite Romance\\r\\n, A brilliant legacy 😉\\r\\n, Wow Wow\\r\\n, Worth watching ⌚\\r\\n, Fantastic\\r\\n, A GO-TO FOR HYPED ENTERTAINING!!!\\r\\n, Shame\\r\\n, The Most Fun Drama\\r\\n, If You are Looking to Have Fun, Watch This\\r\\n, Light hearted and funny\\r\\n, Amazing\\r\\n, One of the greatest drama\\r\\n, When cliche plot done right! Mood booster, very entertaining & refreshing\\r\\n,When I heard of this Korean high school zombie series I was interested, despite the subject matter being done to death over the years. Then I saw the trailer and thought it looked amazing. Having just finished up the show, I can confirm that this is one of the most entertaining shows out there, and far surpasses the likes of THE WALKING DEAD. The small scale works a treat and somehow they manage to eke out the momentum over the whole 12-episode arc. It never feels too small and it never feels dull, packed as it is with expertly directed action and tense mayhem. The Koreans excel in this one and I loved every minute of it.,I can\\'t begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.The show doesn\\'t fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn\\'t very famous and that\\'s good since you don\\'t associate them with other roles that much.The 12 episodes just sped by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Hellbound and Squid Game.,So I decided to give the live action a go because I saw it\\'s No 4 in Ireland on Netflix right now and I found out that it is based off a Webtoon. Yeah it\\'s not a great art so definitely this was the better version personally! I may not be a fan of zombie themed stuff because they are always obvious and you know wtf was going to happen. I mean, this series isn\\'t any different from every zombie flick out there but at least it puts some twists and turns to make you interested. I honestly was interested with how the character Na-ra was able to look less zombish and able to jump from the roof like a ninja?! Yeah I am assuming that cliffhanger would be left to s2 or just giving us poor audience a tease to make out what really happened in our heads. Even if the ending was pretty much a very questionable one, the characters, the music and the storyline in a way were entertaining enough. Yes it is clique in some parts with,using recycled horror tropes but again, I really enjoyed it and glad I didn\\'t bother with the Webtoon...,The show started gripping, quite interesting and super awesome in more than one instances with a stellar second episode (the best out of the lot in my opinion), but quickly got mixed in drama, melodrama and selfless / guilt-ridden sacrificial behavior and ended in a semi-dramatic and mutationally mysterious way.Infection, brutality, devilish evilness and gore gave way to cute friendship, proposals, long talks, chitchats, dramatic and melodramatic behavior with some sacrificial intensity here and there and in-between.I\\'m not against a second season and in fact i would love to see one coming to reality; it\\'s just that the sort of drastic turn of events as depicted happily and mysteriously were sort of weakening and a more brutal, shocking variant and finale would have been more of service to the soul of the show.,The action of the zombies in this show is very realistic. It is interesting to watch the relationship between friends. Well executed until the middle of the series. From the ridiculous lines, to the moronic \"decisions\" to the horrible way they treated some characters. The typical Netflix-style ending was a bit disappointing, but I really enjoyed this show.,All of Us Are Dead: Zombie outbreak at a high school in Hyosan. South Korea. Most of characters are meant to be 16-17 but this is really an adult drama, when the students turn Zombie they bite out throats, take chunks out of people. Victims and Zombies alike jump and fall out of windows, frantic boys and girls barricade themselves in classrooms, battle against the Zombies. Fast moving action just like the Zombies who sprint about. Subplots about bullying and teen romance help the narrative along while the school principal wants to pretend everything is ok. A horror series which shocks but the terror is leavened by the teen love stories. The outbreak spreads. Zombie hordes charging at lines of riot police, even 3 deep they struggle to hold them back. Zombies munching on intestines. The dranas between the still human students becoming more intense. Refugees fleeing Hyosan are \"othered\", feared, even attacked. As so ften happens the authorities abandon the inhabitants of Hyosan while pretending to help them. It\\'s an old trope but is given new life (or death) here due to the editing, acting and direction. How the Zombie virus was created is gradually revealed, it\\'s root cause tied in with events which transpired at the school, you\\'ll have to watch the series to put everything together, no spoilers here! Really convincing acting and effects. Directed by Lee Jae-kyoo and Kim Nam-su. Written by Chun Sung-il. 12 episodes on Netflix. 9/10.,Zombie series with a very classic atmosphere and a very banal but still valid plot. In general the series is entertaining and at times has some very interesting twists and manages well to keep the tension. Many points are tragic and pay off. Too bad that after a while the series becomes a bit too monotonous because the protagonists run away and get stuck in a different point every time until the next episode and this thing in the long run a little tired.,Review By Kamal KSeason 1 - 6/10\"All of us are dead\" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn\\'t fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama\\'s story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.Postive -EntertainmentEmotionsNegative -Plot HolesIllogical Things.,This is one off the charts crazy ride through hell. Wow!!If you enjoyed Train to Busan, you will love this. Insanely intense action and amazing character development and sub plots. Honestly, I could not stop binge watching.I can\\'t praise this series enough. What an incredible ride!!!Well done, Netflix!,On-jo: Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead.Probably the most infuriating show of this year so far. When I looked through this show, I was surprised that there\\'s 12 episodes with 1 hour average runtime per episode. How can you make such a long show about zombies, one of the most saturated horror genres?Just as my suspicion, the first 4 episodes were utter rubbish. It added nothing new, just the zombies pandemic breaking out. At this point I was thinking: let\\'s rewatch Kingdom or Busan rather than this. The only thing kept me forward was the unique way of how the pandemic started.Then episode 5 started, and the show picked up quickly with a new twist. It was very intense, chaotic, and unexpectedly funny. The characters were all hormonal kids, so they are bound to make stupid decisions amid a zombie attack. The twist was pretty good, and I think that it did enough to justify the existence of this show.Character-wise, some were just straight-up wasteful. The two most notable were Na Yeon and On-Jo\\'s dad. Some characters were incredibly infuriating like Nam-ra. The rest were pretty straightforward.One thing that I have to point out. This show referenced Train to Busan, and made it clear that zombies movies exist in this universe. I think that it\\'s supposed to be funny, but this really made the character decisions baffling. One kid pointed out this fact, but no one else seemed to be aware of this fact. The zombies acted pretty much exactly like in Busan and Peninsula. Couple of characters at one point killed zombies by stabbing the neck or head, but at another point had no clue how to kill a zombie. Like why don\\'t they learn? It\\'s an urgent situation, but they can\\'t be that stupid.Overall, this show is filled with problems, but it still added something new and made most of the runtime intense and fun. 6.5/10.,I really liked this show and left reviews on a couple of episodes...but here Im going to talk about major plot holes that for some reason are not being discussed over the internet.So the high school science teacher must have actually created a cure that is neither shown nor does he talk about it. The problem is the cure was only temporary. He cured his son and his son went back to school. But he died or became angry and turned into a halfbie or something else. He could still talk, after fully transforming. But he never talked in any of the videos.Zombies are attracted to thunder and cannot see is thwarted by the flaresThe military does not save the kids saying they could be infected and not know it...By that logic so could everyone back at camp. Making the decision not to save the children completely flawed.Also maybe its a Korean or Asian thing, but why does the military commander kill himself after blowing up the zombies.And lastly i think...The half zombie girl jumps off the roof of the school...We were just shown that they still get hurt even if they can slowly recover...so she just broke both her legs on that landing.All the zombies are dead now so will season 2 be a vampire show?,Having seen shows and movies like \"Goblin,\" \"Squid Game,\" \"Miracle in Cell Number 7,\" \"Train to Busan,\" \"The Flu,\" \"Love in the Moonlight,\" \"Kingdom\" and the Philippine made \"Block Z,\" I can definitely say that \"All of Us Are Dead\" is one of the most okay yet overhyped Korean series and Zombie flick on social media. Featuring storylines and premises done better in the movies and shows I have mentioned - like drama, romance and Zombies in a campus - the series is predictable and only adds one thing new: the \"Halfbies.\",I don\\'t know if extreme bullying, to death, is what Netflix should be pushing on kids right now.I mean, who doesn\\'t like a bunch of pointless hyper-violence, but that\\'s all this otherwise cringey generic zombie movie has going for it. It\\'s annoying, the characters are annoying, the lack of context is annoying... the random attempts at slapstick comedy out of nowhere are ridiculous...Insufferable female characters, super goofy doormat beta male characters... so you know Netflix made this, except unlike white shows, they don\\'t seem to force any \"diversity\" on their Korean and Japanese productions, eh? Everyone\\'s a black-haired Korean with a bowl cut. Now that\\'s not an issue, but if everyone\\'s a blond-haired white person suddenly Netlfix goes out of its way to replace most of \\'em with (( black female and/or another woke-approved default race and gender )).Also I\\'m not happy that Lee Yoo-mi, who played one of the sweetest characters in Squid Game is now playing the pointlessly worst character ever. She\\'s been turned into one of those insufferable female characters that the males are too simpy to throw off a roof. In fact all the female characters get to kick, punch and yell at the males, while they just take it like absolute betas. And if you\\'re okay with this as a male - you\\'re pretty much the same doormat. Welp anyways... PSA over.Watch #Alive instead, it\\'s a much better zombie movie, and yes, it\\'s a movie, meaning it\\'ll take less of your time than binge-watching this trash.I gotta admit though, the cinematography and choreography are amazing, and so is the acting -- at least in the first few episodes. Most of the action-packed shots look like they\\'ve been done in one take, which is incredible. If only the writing was actually good, and the whole \"zombie bites someone and they get a veiny rash, then they\\'re a zombie\" concept wasn\\'t so grossly overdone. And all of this praise, again, is just for the first few episodes, because everything quickly goes downhill in terms of production quality and general effort after episode 3.,Korean Industry has set high expectations about Zombie movies and dramas. So,if I compare this with these than this is nothing infront of those masterpieces. It is an avarage Zombie drama about how the school students survives from Zombie Apocalypse. I find the reflection of \\'\\'High School of dead \\'\\' anime somehow. It is because both occurred at school and they kind of have similarities too. However,I enjoyed it without thinking more. For me maybe, 5/6 episodes would be enough. It seemed to be dragged a lot. As there were no survival techniques were shown, all are about running or climbing the floors again and again. There weren\\'t much character development and plenty of plot holes. Most funny thing is some zombies don\\'t even die after killing multiple times. What they are trying to convey? They are immortal??The ending is awful. I don\\'t think there is any season needed, it was already dragged too much but they ended it this way.,The show started in a brilliant way and I thought this would be some unique in the zombie genre. As things were shown in a very realistic way. But, the way the episodes moved forward I started to lose interest. As I felt some middle episodes were so repetitive & lengthy. The show didn\\'t deserve 12 hrs runtime. After finishing the season I can say the story would\\'ve been completed within 8 - 9 hrs max. One thing I can\\'t deny is that this show was technically brilliant.Each character had its own story, it\\'s not a problem for a series. But, in a Zombie apocalypse it has been shown in a very stretchy way. In the other hand, some characters didn\\'t end up the way they should\\'ve been. As an audience we get to know so many things but the character didn\\'t, that\\'s the reason it was very disturbing to watch some scenes. Last 4 episodes were too much interesting and were the best episodes of the show. Good thing is that we get to know some good survival techniques.Finally, it\\'s not the best in zombie genre but of course A Very Good Watch.Available on Netflix.© Zombieddict.,Meski sesekali melepaskan pijakan dari ruang lingkup sekolah demi menyentil aspek sosial-politik, series Korea ini tak pernah berhenti \\'menggigit\\' lewat segala momen ketegangan dan emosi kehilangan di antara siswa-siswi dengan ragam karakteristik yang amat relevan.Kita sebagai penonton seakan ada di tengah mereka untuk turut merasakan takut, sedih, bingung, putus asa sambil menjaga asa bertahan hidup. Perlahan tapi pasti fokus dan keberpihakan diarahkan pada tokoh Lomon, Ji-hu, Chan-young, Yi-hyun lewat konflik percintaan/perundungan ala remaja.Lee JQ & Kim Nam-soo piawai memanfaatkan sisi geografis SMU Hyosan sebagai panggung teror berlapis sehingga tidak terkesan repetitif. Pergerakan kamera dinamis serta tata rias/kostum dan efek khusus yang terbilang di atas rata-rata berhasil menjaga ritme show secara keseluruhan.Zombie outbreak yang terjadi memang menyisakan banyak pertanyaan dengan simplifikasi logika yang cenderung masih dapat diterima nalar. Pola infeksi tunggal yang menyebar cepat bagai efek domino sukses membuat kita binge-watching atau mungkin repeat-viewing sambil menanti season 2 nya.(Hopefully soon and better, finger crossed).,All of Us Are Dead is South Korea\\'s latest entry into its esscalating body of undead mayhem (Train to Busan, #Alive, Happiness).All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who\\'ve managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse. With 12 episodes running 1 hr long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence, yet it sticks to the basics and delivers a positive outcome, although there\\'s nothing new.All of Us Are Dead\\'s zombie action is never not impressive. Whether it\\'s giant chaotic crowd shots, massive ensemble brawls, or tricky \"oners,\" this is massively kinetic storytelling that will drain you as emotionally as it drains our heroes physically. Likewise, there are dozens of instances involving astounding body acting.All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that\\'s enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.My Rating : 7.5/10.,A Korean high school is the epicentre for a virus which turns the students into flesh eating zombies. The story centres around a small group of students and their attempt to survive as they are continually hunted. It is well acted and it tells the stories of the good and bad pupils which the zombies do not differentiate from when they mindlessly attack. It has plenty of individual introspection as friends and family fall victim and although not the best storyline each episode does enough to hold your interest for the whole series to discover the outcome.,I enjoy K-Drama with Train to Busan going down as a top 5 zombie movie of all time. In it, you saw the motivations for why people acted the way that they did.In this series, I think the mistake was having 12 episodes, meaning they had to stretch out the story using manufactured drama, lots of it, in every single show. There was no reasoning or explanation on people\\'s actions and reactions(Episode 3 will make you toss something at your TV). Also, having a very weak protagonist who causes the death of other people is never a good idea. This series is more closely related to dreadful Army of Dead than Train to Busan. Most of the decisions are just plot devices for failure. At one point you stop caring who lives or who dies.The people who like this will be the same people that say Real Housewives is good reality TV or really liked Twilight. The rest of us is a no.,Although this is a Teenage horror. It is probably rated 19+ for the gore. The horror, as in other Kdramas ike Squid Game, Hellbound, is something other than the obvious. It is also about the people around you and bullying - even when you turned into a zombie.That\\'s the clever part. But there are inconsistencies (like unnecessary sacrifices, stupid moves, and turning up the sentiments - parents dying ), some continuity issues in the beginning and maybe suffers a bit from a large cast. The chaos breaks out at end of episode 1 before all the characters were introduced just to grab your attention. And that is a bit hasty. We want entertainment, but we are not starved.At first there were multiple groups, including the cop that was interviewing the science teacher, the first aid x military dad, the arrow group and the main group in the music studio. This is needed to connect and elaborate the story but you know who is the main character group is. It would be too perfect for bullied girl to get even with the annoying bullying guy. There are some good plot points with mutation, rain/ thunder and toilet making.There are also well done set pieces like the intentional infection, rooftop scenarios and the dispair turning into some hope last episode. Technically well done but some holes like martial law can order such a strike without Parliament/heads of state approval? The assembly person seems to be a setup for next season? The rain gave them water, but no food for like 4-5days???,This is what good television is but you should absolutely NOT compare it to other zombie series\\'. Anyway! Korean zombies are far more terrifying in their look than western TV and film zombies!The Zombies are just as terrifying as the ones in the other South Korean Zombie series\\'; like the excellent \"KINGDOM\" or the brilliant South Korean film \"RAMPAGE\"! I love it and its good fun watchable television; better than any reality series trash!The only time that the series is/was calm and plodding along was in the first episode - before anyone turned Zombie - but after that it was a case of Shock, jump out of skin and a continuous Holy Crap viewing time :) Its come along just in time seeing that \"The WALKING DEAD\" will be no more each week...it had a good run though and was highly enjoyable viewing.Don\\'t sit next to your girlfriend, sister or wife when watching this; unless you are wearing some kind of, good thick anti nails digging into your arm, protection! You will then be safe to watch some great acting and a lot of scary scenes!,The unique thing about this series is, I think the first time ever happen since I watched the first zombie movie is it happen in the world where everyone know about zombie from movie. Its not like The Walking Dead where they dont call them zombie because in their world, zombie never exist, not even in movie. But, in this korean series, they call them \"zombie\" from the beginning. Sacrifice and responsibility plays a big role in this series, when people live in desperation, they never left their side of humanity. That\\'s what make this series fun. Its a fun zombie movie with a lot of action and cliche from all zombie movie in history. Have fun.,There\\'s a lot to unpack here, but the core problem is that there are maybe 6 great episodes worth of content in this 12 episode series.When it gets it right, it gets it very right. Love, loss, longing, poignancy, savagery and pathos, it\\'s all there. The writing, acting and production are strong enough to get you engaged, so as the cast get chowed on, you\\'ll feel it.However, it suffers from uneven tone, with too many cliched tropes and characters. Big-awkward guy, punky-girl, straight-laced nerd hottie, alpha and beta heroes, coward, and generic thug villain. You\\'ve seen them all before, many times.Some scenes eschew peril for jarring slapstick, which breaks you right out of immersion. There\\'s far, far too much shrieking, repetition, indecision, repetition, pointless sacrifice, and repetition.Still, the effects, both practical, makeup and subtle CGI are top notch, the overall story arc is well conceived, and there are a few touching character developments.It\\'s not amazing, but it\\'s solid, and it ends strongly and credibly without pushing the To Be Continued too hard. Just about worth your time.,George Romero, the movie god who invented the modern zombie, always cast ordinary people as the characters in his films. He wanted zombies to represent us in a world of problems so relentless, so savage and so violent that they threaten to literally eat us alive. He wanted a world without death, with no end to our suffering, where we become the monsters when we die. He wanted the brutality to be banal, familiar and up close, where a world isn\\'t saved by handsome Brad Pitt in three hours of pointless CGI.Everyone has problems, and that is why every country has zombie movies. In Romero\\'s US, the zombies represent a population so self absorbed that they have lost track of what is important to them. Both the surviving humans and the zombies themselves seek refuge in a shopping center because consumerism has replaced idealism in this country, In Venezuela, the zombies represent the rapid disintegration after the madman who ruled the country dies. The Venezuelans who try to escape are killed by their own friends and neighbors. In Africa, the zombies are what happens when nature takes the land back from the humans who are trying to change it. In the UK, zombies make England\\'s island isolation into a prison where escape seems impossible.You all know the movies. If you are reading this review, you like zombies.In Korea, zombies are about young people. Train to Busan is the story of a young girl who survives, but to what end? #Alive is about a young gamer. The Wailing is about the disintegration of a village.Korea is rapidly changing. It becomes more Westernized and industrial every day. The generation that lives through the Korean War is dying, and the ancient culture that sustained the country for centuries is being replaced by a First World country with cutting edge technology. However, Korea still sits between China and Japan, and the threat of annihilation from the crazy man in North Korea is ever present.To that end, this series is both the same old zombie by virus plot, but embedded in the daily horror of high school everyone faces. The bullies are nearly as awful as the zombies, the principal is an idiot, the teachers are a mix of caring and stupid, and the pressure to succeed is painful.Zombies invade a high school through the idiocy of a teacher. There are massive casualties as the kids fight for their lives, Only when it is obvious to everyone that all hope is lost does a teacher admit what has happened and tell the kids to leave. Then it is still every person trying to save himself. The virus that causes the zombie infection is stronger than human connection.Young Koreans face a world in which, no matter how hard they work or how much they care, they are not safe from monsters. Teachers don\\'t care if they are bullied. Friends turn against them. And, everyday, they face oblivion.But they are teenagers, and they try.Romero would like this series.,\"All of us are dead\" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn\\'t fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama\\'s story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.,I love zombie flicks! From low budget to no budget to good budget productions. And I couldn\\'t wait after seeing the \\'This will blow you away\\' postings on social media. I decided to set aside the evening and binge watch it. But it was just disappointing. Are people so starved for anything zombie related these days that mediocre passes for mind blowing? I\\'m not sure. But I only made it a few episodes in before tuning out.,Very, very interesting, especially the last episodes of the series. The element of surprise is present in a way that makes the viewer stunned. Advice that is not related to any character.,I really wanted to like this series. Interesting start. Lovable and hateable characters. Wayyyyyyyy overdrawn and annoying at times. They jumped the shark so many times.The plot holes are cavernous.It\\'s so cheesy it\\'s disgusting.It\\'s pretty much anime in live action. Not in a good way.,This series started as weak for me, but it gradually became better. I thought some episodes could\\'ve been better if they were shorter--so much unnecessary scenes.There\\'s some unpredictability in who survives and who does not, I love that. The zombies are definitely terrifying. I also like the fact that they threw some drama in it and made the characters have personality so that you\\'ll at least care for some of them.Anyway I can\\'t wait for season 2. I don\\'t know how it will start because supposedly almost all of the zombies are already gone by the finale. But I\\'m interested in Nam-ra.,The first episodes of this series are wonderful, turning the Hollywood cliché of ill-mannered teens fighting zombies into an almost cartoonish depiction of zombie invasions. Fun. The action is well filmed, the acting adequate and the pacing for the first seven episodes tight and disciplined.Of course, the show is not without major faults, the biggest being characters just standing there as zombies attack, reacting only at the last second. I laughed every time because it plays into the MacGruber joke and does it too many times.Too bad ep 8 is so boring, The series tries to get back on track but loses its way with too much repetition (a sense of deju vu abounds throughout as the series progresses).,Breaking from tradition, \"All Of Us Are Dead\" Season 1 on Netflix did not hold on to its core suspense until later. In fact, they dragged me into the thick of things right from episode 1. This Korean Horror series had what it took to become yet another jewel in the gilded crown of productions hailing out of South Korea.Directors J. Q. Lee and Kim Nam-Soo did great work distributing their talents across twelve outstanding episodes. Seong-il Cheon\\'s screenplay was neat and did not fuss or bother with unnecessary drama. Hillary Huong Vu\\'s VFX was remarkable. Together, their work cut to the chase and conveyed the show\\'s chilling plot in a pace that can best be described as enviable.The story tracked a zombie virus outbreak that occurred in such a realistic, sinister, and unpredictable manner that I found myself smack in the middle of bloody chaos, just like the main characters were in \"All Of Us Are Dead\".Lee Na Yeon (played by Lee Yoo-mi) was exceptional. Lee Su Hyuk (played by Park Solomon) was captivating. Choi Nam Ra (played by Yi-Hyun Cho) was great. Lee Byeong Chan (played by Byeong-cheol Kim) was engaging. Nam So Ju (played by Jeon Bae-soo) was superb. Song Jae Ik (played by Kyoo-hyung Lee) was amazing. Lee Chung San (played by Chan-Young Yoon) was interesting. Park Mijin (played by Lee Eun-saem) was great.Nam Ohn Jo (played by Ji-hu Park) was good. On-jo (played by Victoria Grace) was compelling. Chang Hoon (played by Shin Jae Hwi) was good. Kim Ji-min (played by Kim Jin Young) was noteworthy. Son Myung-hwan (played by Oh Hee-joon) was superb. Han Gyeong-su (played by Ham Sung-min) was exceptional. Jang Ha-Ri (played by Ha Seung-Ri) was captivating. Jang Woo-jin (played by Son Sang-yeon) was good. Park Young-hwan (played by Dong Hyun-bae) was outstanding.All other cast and crew brought excellence to their roles and positions in the Netflix production \"All Of Us Are Dead\" Season 1. I wish IMDB gathered more crew credits for the show\\'s page - sound effects, musical scoring, set decoration, art direction, hair-makeup, and costume design all did amazing work for this series.The tale took place at a high school, which literally became ground-zero for a zombie outbreak. As with most undead fare, one bite from the infected had the potential to infect a normal person and turn them into a monster as well.The unsuspecting students were soon scrambling for ways to escape the nightmare as more and more of them succumbed to the disease after being attacked. Chances for the remaining survivors to make it out in one piece grew slimmer by the second.It all began when Lee Byeong Chan tested something on a lab hamster. The rodent bit Kim Ji-min (a student) and passed the strange aggressive zombie virus to her. It was all \\'hell broke loose\\' from there on, with the disease spreading into the city as well.Added suspicion lay with Lee Byeong, whose son had mysteriously disappeared a while before the day Kim Ji-min fell \\'ill\\'. He blamed the school for his son being bullied, which allegedly led to the boy\\'s suicide.What was the science teacher up to? What sorts of bizarre experiments was he attempting, and why? His reasons were revealed in the second episode, and they were quite convincing. Also, Lee Byeong\\'s talk of the \\'survivalist mentality\\' of a virus was intriguing.I was surprised when Kim exposed Lee to another teacher, and the rest of her class, in episode one itself. She apparently found a way to escape her plastic-ties, which Lee Byeong Chan had used to hold her captive in his lab. The policeman who was later involved in Kim\\'s kidnapping case had ties to Lee (involving the Science teacher\\'s missing son).\"All Of Us Are Dead\" was \\'zombie survivalist\\' gold. The show was interspersed with human elements and high school romance, and balanced with zombie-horror flourishes. They left mini-cliffhangers at the end of each episode, which was more than admirable. Watch the show in the original Korean language (use subtitles). Such soulful and compelling performances all round.\"All Of Us Are Dead\" Season 1 on Netflix was a thoroughly entertaining deep-dive into zombie outbreak storytelling. There was a surprisingly strong emotional element to the series, especially in the finale. It only proved how masterful Korean filmmakers are at weaving a balanced story, no matter the genre\\'s expected theme.,Impossible to believe the rating I tried but cant go beyond three episodes, do not waste your time. No matter how hard you try to ignore the characters stupidity, you will get annoyed. The script , acting, direction is so bad and poor as if either maker is without brain or he assumes the viewers are. Students attacking each other\\'s but the principle is instructing the teachers to call them in class room, a girl is so dumb that she is trying to save her friend who is turned into zombie, a guy is so irritating instead of holding the door he leaves it open to argue with his classmate, the principle is hiding under the table and eating biscuits whole zombies are attacking in front of him etc etc.It\\'s irritating annoying, feel like to throw the maker in front of zombies if given a chance.,Of all the books on the shelves and objects around, he takes a bible and smashes zombies with a bible, which is extremely offensive to any Catholic who cares at least a little about his religion. I do not recommend this to anyone of the Catholic religion. And now the review of the rest, I watched sync in English (netflix), the sync is extremely poorly done, so it\\'s one iritating disaster of the sync. This series promotes violence and abuse (doh so of course zombies are involved, but not that, it actually promotes peer bullying and abuse). The scenes are sometimes too stretched it\\'s really monotonous. It\\'s too bloody and bizarre for some more serious impression. This is just another failed zombie screenplay, this series is a nightmare, no future there! Not recommend!,This follows the well-known and highly successful Korean zombie movie formula that viewers have come to love. We mention here movies like Train to Busan, Peninsula, Kingdom and #Alive. Except for Kingdom, which is a series, all of these are feature films. In the case of Kingdom, the series succeeded in sustaining viewer interest all throughout.All of Us are Dead starts in an exciting way with its fast-paced and taut script. But by the time you reach episode 5, the viewer loses interest. While the lull moments are opportune time for drama, dramatic scenes gradually become a distraction. The surprise ending of that episode involving Gwi-nam tries to put back the story on track, but it appears belated.The young actors (Ji-hi Park, Yi-Hyun Cho, Park Solomon, Chang-young Yoon and In-soo Yoo) are competent. But a meandering story is the problem. At 12 episodes, the series is a bit too long.,A lot of zombie stuff has been done and there\\'s only so much creativity you can come up with if it\\'s already been done. So, when someone comes up with a new show, it\\'s intriguing because I\\'m curious to see what\\'s different about this one. This show is your typical Zombie but story set in a high school. It\\'s got something for everyone.The zombie parts of the show were done REALLY WELL. Acting, action choreography, sound design, cinematography - everything was top-notch. Then there\\'s your typical high school story that was a hit/miss. There\\'s commentary on the society & family values - this added depth to the plot.Overall - it\\'s a decent show with a lot of thrills but with minor pacing issues here and there, think Marvel trying to insert random jokes just because they can. They work, but seem out of place. The show has 12 eps, so this is a decent commitment. Could have been 8 eps, maybe 9.If you go down this road, you\\'ll leave satisfied/non-disappointed by the end. If you\\'ll be mind blown or not, is up to your taste.,This is the type of show you put on when there\\'s nothing else to watch, or if you don\\'t want something too complicated. Some really great acting in this one, I even found myself getting annoyed by some of the characters. Amazing CGI and special effects, definitely feels like it had a big budget. There were some plot holes of course, and some things were just left unexplained until the end but it doesn\\'t really affect the viewing experience.,The Good: I could go on and on about everything I love about All of Us Are Dead, but if I had to point out a few \"killer apps\" that makes this show special, it would be:1) The Characters: I find this show fascinating for its characters. Most of them are well worn Korean TV tropes (the dashing hero, the quiet good girl, the selfish jerk) and none particularly stand out. What is fleshed out and what I observe to be a major cultural difference between Korean and American content, are the RELATIONSHIPS. Ultimately, what makes these characters great is how willing and capable they are in putting themselves on the line to save the group. The interpersonal dynamics, not unique or fleshed out personal characteristics, is what makes them super interesting to watch.2) The Writing: This show REALLY surprised me with the incredibly nuanced take it had on government and the military. The teens, immersed in hell with no one to come and save them, become naturally cynical of the \"adults\" who promise to protect them. The show could have played on the (frankly, lazy) idea of a ruthless, evil government turning its back on vulnerable people. Yet, we get to see the \"state\" perspective on these events as well, and the show forces us to consider the typical Hollywood version of events.If you were on the other side of the quarantine zone, would you not want your government and military to do ANYTHING possible from stopping the spread of a zombie virus? If your answer is no, you\\'re lying.Even the leaders - political and military - depicted are given sympathy and we come to see that they\\'re not purely motivated by personal desire, but a real sense of duty. When the Councillor gives a genuinely intelligent explanation as to why abandoning your post to save your family - as an emergency worker - is the wrong thing to do...my jaw hit the floor. I love a show that acknowledges that the world isn\\'t black and white. It\\'s refreshing.3) The Zombies & Action: Zombies are kind of overplayed. We get them, we\\'ve seen them. Half of the population thinks they could \"easily\" survive a zombie apocalypse. Yet, the zombies in All of Us Are Dead bring the horror back. These contorting, inhumane, unstoppable killing machines are legitimately terrifying and lead to some of the most intense and kinetic zombie action scenes I\\'ve seen in a long time. I think it\\'s safe to say at this point that Korean zombies are objectively the most terrifying. It\\'s with these scenes that the creators had the most fun with the camerawork and editing.Oh, and lest I forget, there\\'s some AMAZING martial artistry at play in this show. Environmental action on par with some of the best kung fu...god I love this freakin\\' thing.4) The Narrative: There\\'s a lot of fun to be had with this plot; we have multiple intersecting characters, half zombies, a Terminator style villain, government intrigue, a mad scientist. It\\'s just a barrel of fun that keeps things going. Yet, this show is completely uncompromising as well; it is sad, depressing, and totally willing to off any character. The tension generated is insane and frankly exhausting at times.But, the ending - which again bucks the tropes - is surprisingly heartfelt and ultimately quite hopeful. It\\'s almost reaffirming in how much faith it has in humanity and wonderful after 12 - often very intense - episodes.The Bad: I have basically two gripes with the show. One, it could\\'ve been cut down a bit and towards the end gets a bit repetitive. But, honestly, I came to love the story and characters so much that I didn\\'t mind. However, I would suggest breaking the show up in chunks and not powering through it.The other issue the inconsistency with the virus itself. I guess some people are naturally immune, but it\\'s a little confusing and sometimes comes off as a plot convenience.The Ugly: This show is super interesting for those (like myself) who love observing cultural differences (which is perhaps my biggest argument for steadily consuming foreign film and TV). Unlike Parasite, something that clearly came from a person who is a fan of Hollywood (and as such, it kind of feels less Korean, more international), All of Us Are Dead feels more grounded in South Korean culture.As such, there were countless moments when I thought to myself...\"an American show or character would do X,\" in contrast to these characters. There\\'s a much greater emphasis on duty (as a parent, as a first responder, as a teacher), saving face, hierarchy (upper classmen are to be respected regardless of whether they \"deserve it\"), group interests over individual interests (all the villains are people who put their own goals ahead of the group) and so on. I found this aspect of the show to really put it over the top for me, as it felt very refreshing and different.,First of all, when zombie attacks started, I thought same thing like other comments ;\\'welcome to train to Busan\\', till now it ok for me I am on second episode. A little slow and too long but still ok. Some scenes are really good as a cinematography, Korean people knows how to make tension.I will not say this is a disturbing zombie series.,This show had me from the very first frame, the cinematography is what drew me in first, then the story and the actors all are excellent in their roles. There is so much going on in each episode and each episode is an hour or so Long. I\\'m on episode 7 and can\\'t wait for my boyfriend to get off of work so we can watch the rest Tonight. This is a crazy good show.,Pretty standard overly dramatic k zombie, the way the characters written are pretty dumb, but then again they are high school students so i guess they were supposed to be dumb? The ever so often comedic bits are pretty much what gets me through watching the while thing. In conclusion, scientist oppar is hot af.,The idea of this show is fantastic. Feels new and fresh. Zombie outbreak starting in a South Korean school. I\\'m intrigued.The dubbing isn\\'t great though which is a shame and some of the writing/acting is a little cliche/corny/cringe. Some decision making is unnecessary. (On-jo\\'s dad basically giving himself up!)But I do like the show. Anything which a zombie apocalypse I\\'ll give a go.Su-hyeok, nam-ra, dae-su, ha-ri, Chong-san are all brilliant characters, and I\\'m glad that there is some sort of happy ending.,It was pretty decent alot of stuff though did make me mad like why is nobody, throwing anyone turning out the window? What was the whole point of that girl being pregnant, why did nobody do as they saw others do and stab each zombie in the face or neck. Why did the girl in pink just die and become a full zombie if she was bitten by the bully kid and same for the kid on white with the bowl cut and naamra whose a super zombie? They did all this running around but there was food and sodas in the closet and nobody touched on that just the candy bar and doing abunch of work to escape a room where they had food and water or sodas. Where was the brains to find a way into the room. Is Chaesun the one who liked Onjo actually dead? Too many plot holes while watching this.But this was a great zombie series and was executed right and had me wanting to watch more and more and i loved the thriller aspect of this and how many people actually died and only a few made it out.,The problem with Korean actors is that you can\\'t measure them by our standards. They act in a way that often looks like pure overacting, and maybe it is. In any case, it gets on my nerves so much that I can hardly endure a film or series from Korea for more than 30 minutes. On top of that, the quality of the content often leaves so much to be desired that out of desperation one begins to read something into it that is not there (Squid Game, Parasite). Hopefully the hype will soon come to an end. And this series here is nothing more than an appeal to the baser instincts of an undemanding young, predominantly probably male audience that feasts on disgusting scenes and is on its way to becoming a generation of jaded psychopaths.,After watching TWD FWD , Kingdom and then this and to be frank this had a vague origin story compared to others but what it did right was not waste time on dragging the story based on each cast for a recap which TWD does for a long long time. All of us are dead adds one important thing the evolution of virus and adding to varieties types of zombies which may or may not happen in the next season but they made the hype happen.So 10/10 watch it.,I\\'m a sucker for these zombie movies and shows. They always manage to pull me into watching it. Korea somehow manages to make zombies more interesting compared to western movies and shows. For example, Train to Busan was absolutely stellar. My hope was that this show was on the level of that movie. The premise is \"Set in the South Korean city of Hyosan, things go berserk one day when a girl in the Hyosan High School is bitten by a rat infected by a deadly virus that turns happy humans into devastatingly ugly and ever-hungry human eating machines\". So does Korea deliver another excellent zombie action or is it a big miss?Let\\'s get the obvious out of the way first, the zombie action is indeed exciting to watch. There are some exciting and creative sequences in this show such as the dining hall sequence which is filmed like one shot. There are some other creative sequences such as one involving a fight between two individuals on top of bookcases while zombies are underneath. Another is where the characters build a giant wall to hold off zombies while they escape the other way. Another is where they create a circular wall while getting from point A to B. All these sequences feel very original and I certainly enjoyed watching them. I also have to give a lot of praise to the makeup artist as the zombies look frighteningly good. The zombie actors also do a good job as well in making them feel inhuman and unnatural. The zombies here are definitely quite scary and that is quite a feat considering how oversaturated zombies are in media.The actors all do a phenomenal job in their portrayal. They all manage to give their characters distinct personalities even if they are just minor characters. The actors who die and become zombies also do a great job as zombies. The story is also quite engaging despite just being mostly about surviving. The story focuses on the dynamic and relationship of the surviving school students. We see them work together but also argue and fight but it never feels over the top or anything. What the story does the best is in delivering on the emotions and there is definitely some emotional stuff. We also got a more interesting origin for the virus that is also quite sympathetic and we got some special zombies that give the situation more spice to it. They also spend a fair amount of time with the military in the series to give the audience an understanding of their response to the virus. There is also quite a bit of romance in this and it surprisingly works well despite the situation not being the exact best for this.However, there is a lot of characters in this show and honestly maybe too many. The show doesn\\'t just focus on one group of survivors and instead multiple groups which lead to a lot of characters to pay attention to. What can be annoying is that a fair amount of these characters have nothing interesting to them but the series still spends a fair amount of time on them. If a character doesn\\'t have an interesting backstory or personality then they are probably going to die which results in predictable deaths. There are also some characters that are just in the series for no reason such as a streamer that I felt added nothing to the plot apart from taking screen time away from actual interesting characters. Additionally, there are so many moments in this series where a character makes a really stupid decision that is frustrating to watch. Also, the characters not going for the head is a big annoyance. It also gets annoying when some characters stand around instead of helping their friend who is being attacked.The series is also a bit too long and can feel a bit exhausting to watch. It is 12 episodes but after watching, it definitely felt like the series could at least be cut down by 2 episodes. There is a lot of sequences where it does just feel like they are padding for time. For example, we will have scenes where we watch characters stand around or just building and not talking or a scene where they share chocolate and it all feels too long and pointless. There is a \"villain\" in the show and that person is WAY too overused and gets defeated in the same way like 4 times, to the point that it is kind of laughable. There are also some potentially interesting plot lines that they could\\'ve explored but it is never utilized or explored. There are also some characters that just die for shock value which sucks as it feels like the show would be more interesting if they were kept alive.Overall, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling and exciting zombie show that unfortunately stumbles on all the subplots created. I did come out a little disappointed that they didn\\'t utilize everything the show introduced effectively but it was still a really good time. It does end with a potential tease for season 2 and it might resolve some of the remaining plot threads from season 1. The ending is also quite interesting and it does make me wonder what direction they could go in. Thus I am hopeful for a season 2 despite the show\\'s shortcomings.,I would rate this close to TWD in writing and special effects - the story came up a little short and the Direction was a little slow at times but on balance a surprise to be sure. It took a couple of episodes to get into the characters but the inter stories were compelling - the show runner my have made a mistake in killing off too many of the characters but the primary ones survived and might give Netflix enough to go with another season - the ending was intriguing and left the door open for a second season with a whole new direction - I will watch it if it does and recommend it for those that are into Zombie movies - my wife isn\\'t but she has other really good qualities.,Although there were some minor illogic scenes but overall its good. Its not a waste even its a paid drama. Its too short though, should be 16 or 20 episodes.The ending reveals that there will be a sequel which I can\\'t wait.,It\\'s a really interesting series, and I\\'m enjoying it a lot. I am a big fan of Korean media in general. I really love how it explores the characters, and their relationship of the people in the situation, because I think it really gives good character development and you really root for them. They\\'re more than clichés and stereotypes.The situations and story are very character driven. I also love the concept for the beginning of the whole thing.I really love how ridiculously heroic and dramatic some of the action scenes are. You think that character should definitely be dead, but they\\'ll heroically kung fu kick, and parkour their way out. It\\'s also not affaid to kill anyone off and it\\'s a really good mix of that.,In the recent years Korean producers have been making good movies in the zombie sub-genre. Train to Busan, Netflix\\'s Kingdom series etc and now: All of Us Are Dead. There are 2 points that I wanna raise here.First things first, the zombie-actors are simply marvellous! Look at those kids!!! I think some are really recruited from kindergartens and they have excellent performances comparable to many adult actors/actresses. Pound for pound these kids can overshadow kids in Walking Dead series. No bias, but Koreans are catching up.And secondly, it\\'s the new concept. Precisely it\\'s not exactly new or original, but it\\'s rare in zom subgenre. Namely the \"asymptomatic\" zom. We\\'ve seen werewolves or vams or Hulk that can change form deliberately or casually or emotionally. But not always seen in zombies, yeah? I like this concept. Cool babe. It\\'s makes the story much more intriguing. U never know the one sitting next to u is a norm or a zom.What\\'s not that good then? Well, the mad science teacher. Yeah I know he has a very special background but, hey, look at him. He\\'s not convincing at all. I don\\'t mean he\\'s a bad actor, but he\\'s not that \"crazy scientist\" in all aspects. When I come to my senses I don\\'t even believe he has sufficient resources to make any significant accomplishment in cellular biology projects. No no no, not even an compelling argument.As a conclusion, I love this series very much. Guys pls give it a shot. If u r a zom fan like me, ask your gal/guy to sleep first and then binge-watch it overnight. Worth your every minute ;),I felt compelled to write a review just because someone compared this to High School of the Dead. This wasn\\'t similar in any way.I actually think the zombies in this show were quite horrifying. I liked the depressing tone, the scary visuals, and the gore. I liked that anyone could die at any time. There were a lot of terrible decisions by the main cast, but overall I found this to be enjoyable.,I like watching a good zombie movie or show from time to time. So I gave this show a chance after seeing the trailer. Overall I\\'d say it\\'s decent but has various problems as well.I think the acting overall is fine but I\\'ll say that I watched it in Korean with English subtitles. As always you may want to be careful with English dubs.Something I\\'ve noticed with Korean shows is that kids/students seem to be pretty nasty and unlikable overall. Is that a common thing in South Korea? You got bullies that actually are pretty nasty criminals and other kids that basically just go along with the bullies where no one speaks out. In addition you have a school where teachers and the principal are more focused on appearances than actually teaching the students. Well, maybe it really is reflecting real life...In this you then have a zombie outbreak scenario where to be honest I thought a lot of those characters deserved to die. The one good thing I want to mention is that the students call these things as what they are => zombies. I always get annoyed when shows try to be fancy by inventing new names for what clearly is a zombie (\"walkers\" for example). The police, soldiers and other officials never call them zombies though.The zombies overall are really inconsistent. Characters are either dying right away or will have a thick plot armor. The students in their capabilities are also very inconsistent. For the most part they will not really fight but run away. Then in some situation they seemingly suddenly mutate to combat and strategic experts just to then forget about that a few minutes later.There is focus on some characters which makes it appear they will play a bigger role later on and then they are just killed off with no real impact. Also the way the whole situation is resolved towards the end of the first season is a bit of a letdown. I guess they were trying to create a complete story in case they will not be renewed for a second season while still keeping the door open. The result is leaving me a bit unsatisfied.,This series has it all:\\r\\nActionGoreSurpriseThe unexpectedand addressing the mundane questions we often mutter, but are not normally addressed - i.e. \\'how do we go to the bathroom?\\'I really enjoyed this series. Each episode is quite long but giving enough time to learn about each character and the situation they are in.Just as you think you have guessed what will happen a curve ball is thrown and it takes a different route to the one you were expecting. In summary this is a series about zombie survival - a story which is way over played - but there is something about the series which tackles the subject in a different way.Characters are killed off you wouldn\\'t expect to be killed off... gore happens when you don\\'t expect it to happen... and the overall surprise of it all makes \\'All of Us Are Dead\\' compelling viewing.If you enjoy zombie survival films then give this a try. 8 out of 10!,I have nothing really negative at all to say about this show it\\'s pretty perfect! Just enough episodes and character arch stories and build, each episode wanting you to keep going. Lots of drama, thrills and omg moments, I cried a lot because this was making me an emotional wreck. I just love it! The cast, the pace of the show! I really hope they continue as there is still more to unfold with it\\'s ending and the hambie\\'s!,This is a big budget, large cast, tightly-scripted zombie (near) apocalypse TV series written as a miniseries. I\\'m saddened to think that there might not be a season 2 since there was complete closure at series end.Very bingeable, great character depth and development as the series progresses. I had one problem with the series that keeps it from getting a higher rating (it\\'s an 8 rating, a 10 rating for overall entertainment):There were too many scenes where the core group of students just stood there like deers caught in headlights, while a single member of the group did most of the battling. Also little prep, no weapons.It happened too often and it wasn\\'t until a second older group of students emerged (senior class, the archers) that appeared more suited to surviving and behaved more like expected. They also understood the importance of arming themselves.I understand the paralyzing fear and their younger ages (+/- 16 years) being a factor. I understand that this is how any younger group might react (so it was well-written in this regard) but it was still frustrating to see this as an adult.Side note: This is the fifth South Korean TV series I\\'ve watched in the last few months. All (except 1) have been really good TV.Recommended (in no specific order):-- Hellbound / JioK-- Squid Game / Ojing-eo geim-- All of Us Are Dead / Jigeum Uri Hakgyoneun-- Sweet Home / Seuwiteuhomxx The Silent Sea (Failed for me)On my watch list:-- Glitch / Geullichi.,\"All of Us Are Dead\" marks the latest high-budget Korean release from Netflix, fighting for room in a genre already groaning from the weight of the likes of \"Kingdom,\" \"Squid Game\" and \"Hellbound.\"Posh Hyosan High School and its affluent pupils think it\\'s going to be just another day of working towards tests and surviving the bullies, deadlines and awfulness of puberty that high school crams daily into 7 hours. But then one student comes stumbling in, claiming a teacher abducted her, and before lunch is over, the entire school, save for a handful of stragglers, will either be dead or dying.Netflix\\'s show sets up its premise well. The premier, having to do a hell of a lot of world building, manages to establish key characters and relationships without too much exposition, and finds some potential drama and tension it can explode apart later. Then the promise is fulfilled in episode 2, which begins with an absolute massacre in the school cafeteria as the confusion and fear of what is happening mixes with more blood than a Wes Craven film. Beautifully shot and well executed, it never lets the gas off the pedal.Sadly, the show then begins to fall under the weight of what it wants to do, and what it needs to do. We get four main threads to follow involving politicians and rescue services, a good natured police officer, and two main groups at the school. That\\'s not including the parents, other surviving school students or faculty, or secret services that need paid attention to, also. By episode 5, there\\'s so much going on (and so many barriers to any progress) that the momentum stalls and the show, despite the numerous chase scenes, resembles a dog chasing its tail.Further, the characters are just horrible. Not badly written, no, but evil, inconsiderate monsters. One may forgive them on account that they\\'re young, privileged and facing a fantastical problem, but even resident bully, Gwi-Nam, is just one of many monsters wearing people faces. It gets tiring to see the students sabotage and ruin one anothers\\' chances over and over again. Redemption is a banned word in this universe, and Neitzche would likely baulk at the pessimism on display.Lastly, the zombie virus is just too complicate to understand. In this world, some people don\\'t fully turn, allowing them to develop super powers while maintaining their identities. I don\\'t understand how a virus can increase strength and speed without boosting muscle mass, but here we\\'ve got kids going at each other like a Rita Repulsa monster smacking down the Power Rangers. Who gets this mutated virus is also arbitrary, with only three people getting this lucky dose (and obviously each is integral to the story).Still, when all is said and done, there\\'s some great fun to be had here. The first four episodes alone are worth catching, and as the kids\\' relationships take center stage in the middle, the cast prove proficient at being good dramatic actors. Even as it lags, there\\'s no denying it\\'s a treat to watch, with scenes of destruction exploding into zombie herds chasing down unlucky survivors. The tension, as threads are cut, snaps in a very satisying way. But, in the end, it\\'s five episodes too long, and plays the same cards too often to be as successful as, say \"Kingdom.\",My boy said about this, so I sat down and started the first episode, what rubbish.I only got half way through it and it had to be turned off.How the hell can this been rated at 7.6 god only knows.It is terrible, do not waste your time....!,Koreans really know how to make a zombie flick!Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.Two episodes in and it\\'s mayhen and chaos all over the school!As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.Freaky zombie outbreak like I\\'ve never seen before (only in Train to Busan).I can\\'t wait to see how it all plays out.,The serie is quite fun to watch but it doesn\\'t bring anything new or special, unfortunately because sometimes these kind of movies from South Korean production companies can be a hidden gem (i.e. Train to Busan). However, it is really a South Korean zombie production so if you don\\'t like that, don\\'t bother to watch it. However, it doesn\\'t meet the level of TWD but it definitely is much better than FTWD.For those who love South Korean zombie production, All of Us are Dead is worth to watch. Sometimes it is a bit annoying and slow that you start to wonder whether you are watching a highschool serie. However, I binged it in a weekend and I kinda got into the main characters of the serie. I just hope that Netflix won\\'t kill this serie and that it will order a 2nd season as the story got potential for another interesting zombie season.,I\\'m not giving this a rating because I\\'ve only lasted two episodes. The action scenes are very well done -- high school kids make wonderfully enthusiastic, energetic extras, whether they\\'re twisting and twitching as man-eating zombies or frantically fleeing the same man-eating zombies.But the scenes without zombie action are ridiculously amateurish: stiff, slow, and lethargic. I began to lose patience when a bunch of high school students, having narrowly escaped the zombies that have overrun their school, feebly barricade themselves inside a classroom and stand around calmly musing how best to phone the police.The scene drags on like a slow dinner party. Two girls stare out the window and literally chat about their teenage relationships (one of them grinning impishly), while just a few feet away, separated by thin panes of glass, a mob of red-eyed students-turned-zombies wave and growl and hungrily gnash their teeth.Zombie movies are by definition silly. Still, if they\\'re to work, the human characters in them should behave with at least some semblance of reality.,After squid game, Korea did they it again! Don\\'t watch the trailer, it will spoil so much. This one is highly recommended, it\\'s wild, entertaining and engaging. There is no nudity,sex and this show feels so real. It\\'s super awesome starting from the 3rd episode. Also a cliffhanger at the end of every episode. Ending is satisfactory. Hoping for the 2nd season.,Since I love the zombie genre and South Korean zombie shows (i.e. Train to Busan, Kingdom, etc) I knew I was gonna give this one a try. If you love guts, blood, and gore I can say this show has plenty of it! If you like whiny teens that make absurd decisions, well, unfortunately this show has plenty of that too! The premise is not unlike other types of zombie shows. A virus gets out and there starts the zombie outbreak. At least with this series, you know pretty much from the beginning how it started and then the why it started develops as things move along. I will say things get tedious when episodes end up with the same scenarios and stuff, so in my opinion, this series could have easily been 9 or 10 episodes instead of 12. Luckily, when the tedious parts occur or the whinny teens start up, the fast forward button comes in handy! The teens, and even adults, make the dumbest decisions in many cases. But, I guess that comes with the territory in all zombie shows and movies. The ending leaves the door wide open for a second season, but I don\\'t know how far they can take the idea of the \"different\" zombies (don\\'t wanna give anything away, but it\\'s a premise we have seen before.) All in all, mostly entertaining with a few down time moments. If you like this genre and like Korean movies/tv shows, give this one a try. And please use the original language and subtitles. Way better that way!,Some pf the places in the scnerio there was problems but its still a very good Zombie scnerio. First of all they dont know how to seperate human/zombie mix.. but it is easy. They are very sensitive with sound, they dont eat normal food, they heal in couple of hours.Some of the bite scenes easily can stop but others were just waithing around. Korean\\'s did again very good job. I love the show. I finished all the episodes in one breath. Reactions were very real, their human needs were very real. Very nice details. Perfect.,All of Us Are Dead doesn\\'t disappoint if you (like me) like a zombie film/series. There\\'s plenty of zombie action and lots of gore, it\\'s a fun show.Just don\\'t expect too much from it, it\\'s a zombie series after all, it\\'s not meant to be taken that seriously. I found it to be an entertaining watch - good cinematography, effects, acting and direction.It has its flaws, the biggest one for me being that there isn\\'t really much of a narrative there, it\\'s just a lot of \"oh no, there are zombies trying to get us, we must escape\" kind of thing, but I still liked it for what it was.If you like the genre then you\\'ll probably enjoy it, if not, don\\'t watch it.,Solid zombie high school K-drama. Beautiful and memorable precious things about High schools and friends are shown inside this show. Suspenseful, heartbreaking and very interesting! Legit acting. This tv series deserves recognition. Overall, very promising and recommend to watch.,..if the zombies in Train To Busan arent enough for u, then this Kdrama will satisfy your needs! I love every episodes! Literally the best Kdrama of the year!,This is a good zombie series, well scripted and does not get boring. I don\\'t know if they are going to make a season 2, but it seams open to it. Wanted the ending to be more happy, but it still seems sad.,This is a decent zombie flick. High school students tried to survive a zombie outbreak at their school. Of course, it would not be a young adult flick without love stories, friendship stories, bromance and .... bullying. You would expect that, wouldn\\'t you?!One thing I would like to add for future zombie script writers. Zombie movies have been around since 1978, so the terms zombie outbreak and its symptoms are not an unknown thing to people nowadays. But every zombie movies always begin with an outbreak that looks like nobody know what it is or what to do. Please, next time write a zombie flick which the protagonists are aware of it and know what to do about it. It would be a refreshing story.Worth watching 8/10.,This show has been pretty good thus far as I feel they have stepped it up a notch from the last Korean Zombie series called \"Kingdom\".The special effects look more realistic of the blood spewin from the zombies necks compared to previous korean zombie series and movies also.I dont like watching anything Korean but I do love their zombie stuff cause its always got superb acting. Out of all Asian zombie movies/shows i would say Koreans ranks the top as I have seen some very terrible ones from I believe Thai Or filipino and also Indian zombie series that were trash.Western Zombie stuff is different then the Korean ones from the way they look too how they transform into zombies.What western shows like The Walking Dead lacked was that it became to easy too kill zombies that their was no immediate danger. As well as the zombies all walk slow vs in the korean series they run and move fast and every encounter becomes a very close escape.I seen some bad reviews on here but i feel these people are not giving it a fair judgement. Some complained about how its repetitive like other zombie shows but when u rate a show/movie u should be rating it for itself and not comparing it to other movies/shows.Thats where Bias mindsets always kick in cause they always keep having expectations set already of comparing it to previous zombie shows or even worse is when people compare how an actor acts in other movies vs current ones.So give this show a chance and dont rate it against other shows, thats not giving it a fair chance at all.Just rate it as it is and how it is presented and you will find you will enjoy tv series n movies more then always having a closed mindset with full on expectations of how it shouldnt be or should be directed n written n acted.,I have to admit, the first 15 minutes didn\\'t grab me. However, I stuck with it and it\\'s turned out to be one of my best series I have ever watched. The young actors and actresses were amazing. The storyline played out every sort of emotion. Even though each episode lasted around an hour, we ended up watching four episodes back-to-back as we were SO hooked. Utterly brilliant and a great ending.,Absolutely. Totally unexpected, but such charismatic characters played with finesse in a story line I never expected would hold my interest. Every once in awhile, Korea presents an amazing series with fascinating characters masterfully portrayed. This was a beautiful series with a background of enigma and moral ambiguity.,Let the bullies be the heroes. Let everyones reactions be strange. Let\\'s not establish any character development. Well that pretty much sums this series up.,I liked the series. Especially viewing how Korean kids typically behave in their normal environment.As to the zombies, they are pretty standard and the kids make the same moves as in most zombie flicks. Ex: staring for seconds too long before reacting, then jumping in to sacrifice themselves, etc Basically, what kids would likely NOT do.But I still enjoyed it immensely. It\\'s a fast paced energy thrill ride.,First, I want to point out that I\\'ve never seen a series of any sort that has this level of action choreography. I mean from EVERYONE, even the zombies and extras. I\\'ve also never seen a series take such advantage of a set before. The verticality is impressive. Everything is over/under/through, and it makes for an incredibly refreshing experience. This is claustrophobia done right!I watched the English dub, so I can\\'t comment so much on original dialog, but the dub was acceptable, and the actors certainly emote well.I have to knock off a couple points for some of the character choices/motivations that just don\\'t make a lot of sense. We have a young lady infect/murder a kid because he\\'s poor (I think?). We have a military leader that kills himself out of shame after bombing the hot zone? Other weirdness might be chalked up to my ignorance of Korean culture, but I don\\'t really understand a girl beating a kid who professes his love to her, or the girl who wants to die because of some risque pictures being sent to classmates that are all already dead, and don\\'t have access to their phones anyway?Finally, I think most of the 12th episode really just existed to leave things open for another season. I don\\'t think it should been included.Hiccups aside, I had fun watching this series. It was exciting, visually gripping, and despite its flaws it kept me binge-watching to the end.,Not sure what to make about the people giving this rave reviews. My guess is they\\'re really young or just paid accounts. This series was very disappointing (as usual with Netflix). Poorly written, acted and execution. If you\\'re looking for the next Squid Game this ain\\'t it. Not by a wide mile. Trust me on this, skip this low budget trash.,Guess what this Gen Z said \"This show is so violent \" lol what ? This is zombie apocalypse not romance, do you think this is Hollywood when there\\'s kisses and nudity and cringy criticism? No this is korean they work so hard , they have incredible actors and all the crews behind camera , this is not WARM BODIES OR WORLD WAR Z , if you want no violent shows go somewhere in Netflix you will find bunch of garbage, btw I loved this series and I hope to see more of this story in future because we all now that netflix doesn\\'t care if you liked or not ,they care about views numbers if this is successful so 100% there\\'s s2 and 3 .,This is gonna be one of the best show I\\'ve watched this year. The production, directing, characters, performances & everything else is truly superb. I have not binged watch many shows (except Daredevil & Squid Game) because they just don\\'t hook me into them but i was hooked to my screen from the first 5 minutes of this show & binged watched it till the end.Now the performances of every actor was great. I genuinely loved all of the friends, supporting cast & bad guys too. It also reminded me of my school days with some good memories in the first episode. I think this one got it all from being funny to make us emotional & yeah the zombies too that were great!You know this one\\'s underated when extremely below average & dumb Netflix shows like Money heist, Lupin etc., or the other Marvel\\'s Disney+ Hotstar shows got above 90% on rotten tomatoes & shows like this got below 80%.Overall a highly recommend show to binge watch with your friends or family (No unnecessary sex scenes or nudity) . Waiting for the next season.,It\\'s another wild ride from the Koreans definitely worth watching. Will keep you entertained for a weekend. There are some annoying things about characters I wish they could fix then they really would be superb. The lack of emotions and chemistry between the actors. They are great actors but we need to see a range of different emotions and expressions conveyed. For example you rarely see smiles just dead pan expressions.,I like how the characters are facing zombies without using guns and instead use everything they can as a weapon. In most of the zombie media I\\'ve seen characters often use weapons to defend themselves instead of coming up with clever ways to kill them.,As a zombie series its decent. What is groaningly bad is the dialog and situations. \"She likes you, are you going to date her?\" A girl worried about embarrassing photos. Students bickering about juniors verse seniors. Really? During a zombie outbreak? Drags it down with a campy feel like a low budget teen flick. And, too often, when things go bad everyone stands and stares instead of doing something or running away.,Its a good zombie show, was slow at parts but i overall enjoyed the show. Best thing about korean dramas on netflix is i don\\'t have to watch force diversity or identity politics that are plaguing the U. S t.v shows.,I am a fan of zombies and Korean movie industry has built some good reputation in this matter. BUT this series may have pulled down the reputation because this series is so bad such that I wonder if it was directed by teenagers.Bad acting!Good thing is that the mystery got explained very soon in the second episode (if you can go that far).Those creepy/zombie scenes are totally predictable and common in a zombie-themed series/move so they can\\'t be constituted as a reason to give applause to this series.Too many scenes are not logical at all. For instance when Onju was pressed against the floor by a infected male student, what should be expected is she simply can be bitten. But no, apparently she holds the fight and get away with the zombie. But wait! One second ago she is too terrified to move and next second she fights back the zombie.And the extinguisher can also defeat zombies?It just a tip of iceberg showing how bad this series.,Despite some flaws, this show is a pretty good zombie series and I was rather surprised at how binge-able this was.It did a very decent job of presenting gore, mystery, thrill, drama and--of course--romance. The overall effect of the plot is captivating that you find yourself drawn in. The makeup on the zombies is extremely disgusting, which superbly serves its purpose. The mystery and thrill of the story does a good job to keep you glued to the screen, wanting to know what happens next. Although a lot of characters remain flat, I\\'m glad they aren\\'t all so one-sided.My biggest gripes of this series are 1) how quickly they get rid of characters without giving them a chance to really make an impact or finish their stories 2) the frustrating decisions some characters make leading to dumb consequences (seems like a theme for a lot of horror/thriller movies, which could be fixed). 3) The color of blood on the costumes at times feel a bit too pink, but that\\'s coming from someone who works in film. 4) The CGI feels very unrealistic at times, which takes you out of the film. If these elements were done better, I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more.If you\\'re into zombie shows, this deserves a shot. It has a lot of gore, endless action sequences, mixed with different character relationships and thrilling nailbiting moments.,I wanted to watch this series for a very long time but resisted myself because I know that South Korean thriller series\\' are generally hideous, hopeless and hollow. However, these kind of series are a kind of guilty sorrow for me. I had to watch it.I am quite impressed, I should say. It is like an anime. 2D characters, all stuck in this unbelievable action flick, everyone wanting to survive but most die. Start watching it with less expectations, you will really get to like it.As I said before, it is an anime kind of film cent percent. So, expect things to go berserk and OP. If you love such kind of films/series, go watch it now. You won\\'t regret!,All of us are deadBursting with well executed zombie action scenes and a plot that\\'s as emotional as it is dire and dreadful. It is also teeming with an array of characters that you would love and hate. It starts and ends well, in a way that accommodates a second season if approved.It was also overly long and drawled, leaving room for so much redundancy. A lesser number of episodes with shorter runtime would have worked better.,I had little expectation when I began streaming this show but am very pleased with it. It\\'s about teenagers and there\\'s campiness involved along with the drama. Very tongue in cheek which makes it a nice reprieve from all the over-the-top zombie action. Good character development, excellent dubbing, good storyline. Although the scene of the Captain\\'s escape and swimming away amidst a crazy barrage of bullets with only one bullet barely grazing him made me laugh... that\\'s why you can\\'t take this so seriously. I also love the references to Train to Busan (which is one of the best zombie movies out there). This is very entertaining and worthwhile if you like this genre.,The series is great but considering 12 episodes are still a little bit too much 10 episodes are good to go. You\\'ll get hooked up in the whole series every episode gives a thrilling sensation but there are still many flaws in this series that should\\'ve been better and many people should\\'ve been alive if it is not because of the selfishness of some students. The series is lacking common sense that made you go mad for some reason just by watching how they deal with such an incident. I don\\'t know if the scriptwriter/director is dumb or this is all part of the plan that they\\'re supposed to look stupid and act stupid. Overall nice series but not favorite as Kingdom, Train to Busan, #Alive, etc. Still it can be done better, definitely worth to watch but not worth to watch for the infinity.,Korean shows tend to be really hit or miss for me. Sweet Home, My Name, and Squid Game are all great shows with well-developed characters who act in a believable way given their situations. This show is definitely a miss for me though. The writing seems to focus only on making things dramatic; characters do terrible and dumb things for no discernible reason, since in many cases they haven\\'t been developed enough. The kid on the roof who we barely know screws everyone over because... reasons? The Military commander is ruthlessly evil in some scenes and then in other scenes tries to take the high ground and and lament what they have to do, and it just doesn\\'t feel coherent. The writers also forgot that humans need water to survive, even though one of the students says in one of the earlier episodes that they are already dehydrated. It even starts raining at one point and NOT ONE PERSON thinks to get a bucket or something and collect some drinking water. The EMS father finds a stockpile of guns and only brings one because ...? And then he gives his only gun away before he even gets to the school? Soooo much stupidity in this show. I could go on and on but you get the point. If all you want is drama and you don\\'t care about character decisions making sense, then by all means give this show a go. But if you are the type who gets annoyed when characters behave in dumb or unbelievable ways, stay far, farrr away.,First things first, this series has insane amount of gore. So it\\'s a warning, anyone who is sensitive or cannot tolerate gore should stay away from this series.When I finished 2 episodes of this series I thought, \"what is new? It\\'s that usual zombie survival series that Korea produces every year\". I felt it was like ALIVE but set in a school rather than apartment. Moving further into the series I realized, it is not usual.Zombie survival series are always interesting no matter how old they become. Having watched so many zombie based films/series, I now find those snarling open mouthed zombies absolutely hilarious. Either they look disgusting or they look hilarious.However, what makes this series so different from the other zombie ones are these:-1. The fact that it deals with the mental state of the bullied school kids who get no help or comfort, like how Eu-Jin wishes the school burns down and everyone gets killed after her being bullied. This results in grave consequences later in this series watch out for that.2. The fact that the zombie virus is justified this time. Most of the time we get only a faint detail of the infection but this time, through the videos of the professor, we get to witness a lot of details about the virus.3. The fact that the makers have decided to introduce a new kind of zombie into the series which later turns into a grave danger for all.There are many more new elements in this series and that\\'s a huge plus point for a genre that normally doesn\\'t get much different treatment.Loopholes, quite a lot including some really illogical scenes that I could not help but scratch my head at those points and the fact that the series is unnecessarily stretched. Each episode is about more than an hour long (honestly, it is just 1 hr on average considering credits start playing with 5 mins left at end) and there are 12 episodes. You really feel the drag when the student gang talk and share their feelings amongst themselves on a rooftop and these were some parts I genuinely skipped.Overall, I think the makers did a good job by introducing new unique elements into this zombie series otherwise I was ready to bash up this series left and right had it been that usual zombie survival series that are available in millions on Netflix.,I actually find it quite slow and boring. I am on episode 4 now but going to skip a few. Maybe something will happen instead of every episode the same.,Who greenlit this to be a 12 episode series? It\\'s so dragged. No story just talking talking and more talking for 12+ hrs. It should have been just 6 or 8 episodes. Wasted potential.,One can easily relate with the characters with lots of emotions,humour&spine chilling moments that will carry u along the series.....with the major supportcoming from the make-up and vfx dept and as usual koreans are known for their screenplay perfection this series is a must watch.,I looked forward to this kdrama and the trailer was quite good as well. So, I had expectations for it. I even completed reading the Web toon to get ready for the watch.But, it was kind of disappointing. I directly compared this drama to \"Happiness\", which is another Zombie centric drama that was aired just mere months ago. While \"Happiness\" had a lot of things right and had found a right balance between the Zombie action and human interactions, \"All of Us Are Dead\" was just mindless actions in most of the episodes. Sometimes quite repetitive to the point that we can easily predict the outcome.I liked the four leads, but other than the characters of Lee Cheongsan and Nam Ohjo which were built well, Lee Suhyeok and Choi Namra\\'s characters could have given much depth. Especially Namra\\'s who had the most interesting character arc. But hers was not explored till the last episode.Likewise there were so many things that fell short of expectations. Including the final explanation that the Webtoon carried. Anyhow, the drama is still enjoyable and the action is good. The settings and choreography are well done as well.Good effort. But overall, the drama is just okay.,I was quite excited when I first heard about another zombie Korean thriller. I didn\\'t particularly have high expectations for this one but I did hope it would be memorable. It\\'s way too long with many unnecessary plotlines. I think it could have been perfectly wrapped up in 8 episodes if properly executed. The main characters were dull to me and I couldn\\'t relate to any of them,especially Nam Ra.There were way too many foolish decisions that were only introduced for shock value and character development. I don\\'t see myself revisiting this show unlike the others I\\'ve watched of its kind.,I totally love these South Korean series. They are inventive, beautifully made and fun. And there is always a subtle, gentle and tender message. Yes it\\'s a zombie serie but it is somehow sweet. Actors are great and very likeable and direction is brilliant full of inventive touches.BUT..please,please,please find some decent English speaking dubbing actors and translators. These are absolutely painful.,Loved this! I don\\'t think there was a single episode that didn\\'t keep me on the edge of my seat!It had a little of everything, plenty of violence, funny moments and some really touching moments which won\\'t be everyone\\'s cup of tea if they just want a run of the mill zombie movie!I thought it was fantastic, ended on a cliff hanger so already looking forward to the next season!,It\\'s not as bad and it\\'s not as good as people are saying.Some of the contrivances in this are just insane. Your suspension of disbelief has to be at an all-time high to excuse some of the characters ridiculous/poor decisions. Now, that doesn\\'t make it a bad show. BUT, it does mean you\\'ll be sat there yelling things like:\"Omg close the door behind you!\"\"Would you run, run, like seriously! RUN! You have so much time!\"\"Just tell her! Omg just tell him! Talk to each other!... OMG!\"Why are you still standing there? DO SOMETHING!\"\"Can no one see that? It\\'s right there, are these people blind?\"\"Wait at the end of the last episode he was about to... How is he... what?\"\"How do you kill these things? He shot it in its... but wait she shot it in the... wait what? Do you need to destroy the brain or not!? TELL ME!\"Now, if you can ignore all the times you\\'ll feel this way, WHICH WILL BE A LOT, it\\'s an okay zombie show. Initially I was worried about teen angst, I don\\'t like teen drama, it\\'s usually boring and revolves around people not saying things that could easily solve 90% of any and all problems. Luckily the show splits its focus from time to time, and we get to see some different groups of people dealing with very different situations. It\\'s a good break from the Teen angst and let\\'s us see glimpses of how the world is reacting to this situation. With that said, there is a lot of teen rubbish in here. I think if this were written a bit better, with less contrivances, and characters I actually cared about, I could\\'ve given it a higher score.I think if people are overly positive about this it\\'s probably due to the whole K-pop vibe people are on... Essentially, anything Korean gets a pass due to pop culture favouritism. Whereas, if people are overly negative, it\\'s potentially due to the cliched teen drama, contrivance filled writing and dumb character decisions that they can\\'t overlook for the sake of entertainment.Look, it\\'s no Kingdom. It\\'s no Train to Busan (THE 1ST ONE OMG that second movie was baaaad). But it\\'s an okay watch.Oh, the ending was kinda bad and the final episode dragged. Definitely could\\'ve been less episodes.If you\\'re already a zombie fan, you\\'ll find this okay, heck, you may even like it. There\\'s a lot of fake reviews on here, but I think any review scored between a 7 and a 4 can be trusted as coming from an OBJECTIVE reviewer.,I\\'ve read webtoon \"All of us are dead (Now at our school)\" right after watching the trailer of this show. It wasn\\'t a lengthy comic with a heavy conversation, so it was easy to turn to the next chapters. I\\'m not a fan of the style of the comic, but it was still fun and intense. I\\'m in the 5th episode right now, and so far I\\'ve felt the show adapted the original webtoon quiet well which is why I wanted to write a review about it. However, I get to see these assumptions of promoting High school of the dead from the comments which is not okay seriously. I also watched High school of the Dead long time ago. All I can remember is that the anime was more about female body images rather than zombies and stuff. Plots and characters in both shows, there\\'s no any similarity between the two. The only similar aspect is they both use high school students as main characters. Honestly, Is there anime that doesn\\'t use high school students as main characters? Seriously, google High school of the dead anime, and watch it on youtube, you\\'ll get the idea within 2 minutes. I would not recommend to watch it with female companions or friends though. Back to the show, All of us are dead, it\\'s well made, and it adopted the original story very well.Update: I ended up watching the whole series for 2 days. It\\'s worth it just as other positive reviewers say. It\\'s well paced, and mixed with good actions. Also it created a different type of zombie.,I put off watching this and eventually started the first episode and binged it and finished it as fast I could. I binged squid game in a day but couldn\\'t with this for various reasons, none of it being my lack of interest.It definitely gets some things from train of busan but that isn\\'t bad because that\\'s a great movie itself. I thought 12 episodes was going to be too long but would have liked another episode rather than a subtle hint that could lead to another season. It should end with the last episode.The thing that intrigued me the most is the zombie and the sets and how hard it must have been to put makeup on all of them and dress them accordingly and the effort of rehearsal to get some of these scenes done right. This absolutely deserves many awards. The acting from the kids is meh but everything else is top notch.,I enjoy the zombie premise but the characters talk way too much. One group literally spends entire episodes talking and not utilizing their surroundings for survival.A lot of high school drama. But mixed in with a lot of terrible adult storyline and acting. The show lacks focus.Coming off of the walking dead series, this show really focuses on running and not fighting. The constant running and bickering can get tiring.,I could only watch 1 1/2 episodes, there is just too much bullying going on. I wanted to watch a show about zombies, and I got a show about mean kids, another Korean show I\\'m watching has some focus on bullying also, but that\\'s not the main focus. I have to ask, Is the entirety of Korean high schools filled with nothing but bullies and victims? I suppose if you can get past the almost constant bullying you might get to the part with the zombies, I gave up this just turned me off.,People are flying out windows, others being attacked all over the school, yet half the school is carrying on as if nothing is happening. And teen love stories galore NAUSEATING.,...watching someone turn into a zombie before they take action? You take action before they get off the floor and try to bite you. It can be forgiven the first time (maybe even the second time), but every time? And it seems all the kids know zombie lore (one of them even mentions Train to Busan), yet don\\'t act accordingly to defend themselves?I\\'ve been watching a lot of Korean shows, and there\\'s a trend where people don\\'t do the right thing so they don\\'t embarrass themselves or the job. And everyone always seems to be up for a job review, and it\\'s better to let people die rather than speak up to avoid a negative review. Is it a narrative staple in Korea, or is that actually the culture (like the incessant crying in Korean tv and movies)?I\\'ll still watch the shows because they\\'re still a hell of a lot better than the American crap.,Holy WOW! This show blew me away by excellent production quality especially the zombies, amazing young talented actors, and excellent storyline with depth not just senseless zombie flick.Honestly I never thought that after Walking Dead\\'s massive let down I would ever enjoy a Zombie flick but this show just took it to whole new level. It had everything you need, a great storyline from start to finish, excellent mind boggling graphics, excellent cast, emotion, gore, cringe, and edge of your seat scenes, adrenaline and more.Wow. Hollywood needs to wake up and take lessons from Korean shows! They are just on another level! I really hope there\\'s a Season 2 for this show. I am totally hooked!,The show doesn\\'t pretend to be intellectual or sophisticated. It is straight up what a good classic zombie drama should be- packed with heart-thumbing action throughout, characters that one can relate to and despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and some really emotional & heartbreaking moments towards the end.,If you are watching this show only for the gore (like some of the low ratings here), it is not for you.Yes, there are very bloody moments and somewhat unbelievable zombie sequences, but that is a mere fraction of what this show is aiming towards. Under the \"zombies\" and \"fighting\", there is excellent emotional tension and moral exploration. From the students to the officials, the implications of moral judgement are monumental to the progression of the plot. Within the inhumanness, the interactions of such characters entrance us into a somewhat first-hand view of their relationships, where the threats from the \"zombies\" are often side-lined. This led to a truly well rounded series. This is matched with a great musical score, good direction (mostly) and excellent performances all around.There are a few things I didn\\'t like. Firstly, there are many scenes where it feels alot like a soap opera. Characters freeze up way too often, and such moments are quite cliche.Secondly, the girls in this episode, (except one) are extremely sterotypical, and to an extent, useless. Most of them just stand around and whine, sometimes even when the group is being attacked. They after running two steps, they can\\'t get up, they sulk and cry instead of fighting back. I would like to see more women step up and become emotionally and physically strengthened.In general, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling show that often side-lines the blood and gore of a traditional zombie show for a emotionally charged and humane primary plot. It is at times stereotypical and cliché, but it is an excellent binge-watch. I had an excellent time watching it, its topping the Netflix charts, and I would certainly recommend it.,Last episode let it down with characters making stupid decisions to go after lost causes and having weak dialog. I think the show could have concluded on the 11th episode and I\\'d have been happy at that. At the best of times the show was frustrating watching characters bicker with each other in life and death situations or seeing them needlessly sacrifice themselves.Another particularly frustrating thing to see was Nam-Ra only utilise her strength in the last episode when she could have done more in previous episodes to help the group.Also at times it was very convenient how dozens zombies would be chasing characters in one scene, and then in the next scene it wouldn\\'t show how the characters had somehow outran them, the particular scene coming to mind is Onjo\\'s father in the stairwell during the evacuation of the politicians.Some things I really liked: the virus origin story, it was refreshing to see a different take with a zombie virus that could be explained. And with a sad story behind it. I also really enjoyed the setting of most of it taking place in the school. The show was very tense at times, and the setting really added to it.I really liked Park Mi-Jin, her bratty attitude and lines were very funny. And Onjo\\'s father and his undying will to save his daughter really added the sad drama to the show.The show also created some very good characters which you want to see fall, and it delivers on that front as well.Overall while not a perfect show, it is very entertaining and delivers a fresh addition to the zombie genre. Hopefully that is the show done because I wouldn\\'t want to see them make another season.,I\\'ll keep it short, the film is action-packed and thrilling - minus the first episode. So you really have to live through the pilot where the writers basically wanted the viewers to get a sense of the show\\'s mood. Honestly, it felt a little unnecessary... Nevertheless, the succeeding episodes were heart-pumping. I didn\\'t want to stop watching at 3 am.Anyway, the problem is not if it lives up to Train to Busan, because of course it won\\'t. Different setting, tone and character focus. But the issue is how the writers only make characters likeable the moment they\\'re about to cut them off.Believe me, I love an emotional character death but to kill of the interesting ones that the audience root for at such an early stage is just annoying. At least semi-develop the other nobodies before killing the charming ones. Other than that, the show\\'s pretty good.I have to comment the casting too. I don\\'t know Korea\\'s standards but WOW everyone\\'s so good. Even the random child saved by the police had great acting skills. So yeah, that made the experience more terrifying.Hoping for season 2. 💪🏻 Give me someone to root for from episode 1 to... at least episode 5-6.,This was way better than I thought in the beginning.Surprisingly the kids actors do a great job, sometimes when actors are this young I get bored easily, but this time, it was really hard to watch them go thru some of the hardships they had to face.The half boy zombie is odious to the max, very well written and executed. The half girl zombie too, she did an amazing job of being first a victim, then a killer, props to both actors.The other kids too, great chemistry from such a diverse cast, their differences and similarities are well defined.But, be prepared, anyone can die at any time, don\\'t get too attached to any one character. The mother, the friend, the teacher, anyone can die. Great writers!,Decent show - I will admit reading the other reviews I can kind of understand peoples opinions about the first 2 episodes, they are arguably the weakest, and things really pick up in episode 3 and especially in episode 4. Overall though, it\\'s fun, jumpy, some fun characters and awesome zombie chase scenes. Another solid Korean flick - ignore the haters.,This show had me hooked! It was really good, but sadly the ending was just so stupid. Everyone\\'s got their opinion, but I don\\'t understand all the bad ratings. It isn\\'t flawless and it has some inconsistencies about how soon someone \"turns\". And a lot of the characters just stand around being really stupid instead of running or helping their friends, every single time someone starts turning, like they just never learn! But I\\'m pretty sure every zombie show/movie I ever saw has those same issues. And please watch it in Korean if you can. I only ever watch these foreign shows in their original language which makes them better. The English voice actors for this one are just bad. Real bad. Ruins the show.,A nearly perfect zombie series... definitely worth watching...\\r\\nThe rating should be above 8 star\\r\\nUnderrated...\\r\\nAgain proved that korean dramas makers are 🔥🔥 creativity, story, visuals, technicalities, choreography..,All of Us Are Dead is fine.But it is a conceptually very juvenile show. The whole origin of the epidemic is difficult to digest. This series has a certain bizarre tone, that tries to balance the drama, comedy and action-horror, but it doesn\\'t always work. Or it won\\'t work for everyone the same way.Having said this. I had fun. The various points of view on the zombie apocalypse are very well made. Action scenes are great. And the overall production value is pretty decent. There are several characters I liked, and I was sorry to see some of them being dismembered.Despite having some problems with the more childish elements of the narrative, this series, in general, provided me with good times.But it\\'s definitely not as refined as Squid Game. Despite being very ambitious in its proposal.I rate this series 7.5 out of 10.,I am enjoying the show. I think Koreans know how to make a zombie movie or a show. I binge watched it entire Saturday and watched 9 episodes in a row. But since I need to sleep, I will watch the rest (3 episodes the next day, Sunday 30th Jan),7.5 is my correct rating. If you are a fan of zombie series this is definitely your cup of time. This series have heavy brutality and violence and everything looks real. The making camera moment all were fantastic.The main defects were the length. 8 episode were have been perfect but they dragged a lot at the end. The other defects were about the zombies. The zombie should be like the usual like in train to bushan but they changed it . Some of the enfected people don\\'t become zombie and thay get super powers . Feels like they copied sweet home.Anyway it is a fun series for zombie fans. The others may not have liked it and don\\'t expect anything like kingdom.,If you\\'re a fan of zombie genre then you would find it to be better than most of the existing Zombie based TV series/movies but the concept is predictable. There are few loopholes that are visible to the naked eye but still the production value makes up to it. Some of the characters are too shallow and they could\\'ve trimmed it to 10 episodes as 12 episodes felt a bit lengthy. Other than that, it\\'s worth a watch.,This was a massively will done show, the stories were good the effects were nice and the goriness was what you\\'d expect from a good zombie show..\\r\\nWatch it and enjoy..\\r\\nWell done 👍,I enjoyed the series. However, what a turnoff seeing attractive Korean girls/women wearing sweatpants underneath their skirts. Whoever embraced that fashion needs mandatory jail time. The Koreans have been putting out some great zombie/infected movies in the past decade.,This series isn\\'t bad. It\\'s just a bit frustrating at times. The action and gore is pretty good, and the acting is also good, especially from the zombies. Who are all so realistic and played superbly. My biggest issue is the STUPID decisions that the characters were making. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever shouted at the tv so much in my life. A fun and entertaining watch, if you don\\'t mind not taking it too seriously.,Absolutely gripping and thrilling from the start. Fingernail biting scenes and total thrill and tension.An amazing show! Totally love it!Harsh, brutal and gory at times, exactly what you would expect.That\\'s how a zombie series/movie is made. Zac Snyder could watch and learn.Pure awesomeness!If you like the zombie topic, this is for you.Two thumbs up!!,Nice series\\r\\nits not prefect 10/10\\r\\nits like 9/10 in my opinion\\r\\nif u wana a 10/10 korean series?U should watch series likeFlower of evilGoblinCrash Landing on Youmy dangerous wife.,Who knew that a zombie outbreak would start at a high school in south Korea but I got to say it was full of action and suspense and drama etc I recommend this show to anyone 17+ if they are really mature p.s. Its very graphic.,There is no coherence whatsoever: zombie turning may go from seconds to several minutes depending on the character. The amount of stupid decisions and unrelatable characters get me siding with the zombies by the 2nd episode. Save yourself from this.,I like South Korean movies and series. But what a waste this one, a typical Netflix production. No strong story, directing and not ever once complelling. Too bad SK.,This is a great zombie show, the inconsistencies some have complained about between the zombies is explained later as they state the virus is constantly changing and that\\'s why there can be no cure.My biggest issue with this show is that on multiple occasions they use the typical annoying Hollywood scenarios where some character makes a dumb choice and screws things up for everyone.Also it\\'s incredibly hard to watch scenarios like the kid on the roof who decided not to help at all when the rescue chopper comes.Could have been better no doubt, hopefully they\\'ll improve for season 2.,The moral of this story? Good guys (people) finish last.I love zombie flicks and South Korea made one of my all-time favorites: you guessed it... Train to Busan. But here they\\'ve taken an ENDLESS amount of time with character development, but why? To get us to like the characters so that it stings even worse when they kill them off? Yeah, I know lots of dead characters is to be expected, but they spend 11-ish hours on character development and it just feels like they\\'re torturing us.I\\'m almost done with the series. I watched it all because currently there was nothing else on Netflix any better. But I didn\\'t enjoy it as much as I wanted to.,This could have been compacted easily into 8 episodes...10 at most. Something\\'s dragged forever and meant nothing.The thing that got me is how, after the long , long time they saw how the zombies worked and then formulated escape plans, these kids would STILL stop and stand around looking at things when it was just time to run. Too dramatic and too stupid.Nice try with some hairy moments; I was glad the punk with the mullet FINALLY got it. He was annoying.Train to Busan was much better, but a good try here.,You end up hoping your favourite characters survives and there\\'s some you hope get eaten.Lots of unexpected deaths and you never know who\\'s next.The zombie aspect is done well with good cinematography. There\\'s some truly sad deaths and it\\'s worse when the situation could have been avoided so you feel for the other people.If you want to watch a thrilling zombie movie, with likeable characters and one\\'s you root for to get bit next, you\\'ll like this.,Now I like series from Korea better than series from the USA! Why is that?This is certainly not due to the themes, because the Asian filmmakers work through what is also very popular in Hollywood: horror, zombies, violence, coming of age, supernatural powers and so on.But what is the attraction of the films and series from Korea? Above all, that they deal with themselves and their topic without imposing a restrictive corset of rules in advance. In the United States, political correctness now rules all forms of entertainment. Small fringe groups have a stranglehold on the former dream factory and are trying to distort it according to their own moral ideas.Luckily, wokness is not known in Korea and let\\'s hope it stays that way for a long time to come!\"Jigeum Uri Hakgyoneun\" rides the wave of success of \"Squid Game\" and shows an entertaining and believable mixture of coming to age and brutal zombie horror.The result is good, albeit with some lengths.The future of good entertainment is no longer in the USA!,Yes, some holes are there in plot but but.They are very very minimal.All the show was done with very good highdrama and action and complete realistic zombie series ever made in entire cinema world.Friendship, Honesty,Love, Survival, right to live was portrayed very well.10/10 rating was very less\\r\\ni will give 1000/10 .The efforts they had made to make this series is very greatest.,I\\'ve watched a lot of zombie movies and TV over the years, and I thought All of Us Are Dead was among the best. The action was often incredibly exciting and tense, and the high school students\\' developing relationships seemed emotionally believable to me. (I mostly watched in Korean with English subs - the English dubbing struck me as weak, causing many dialogue exchanges to sound stilted and overacted.)Also, even when I like an action show where a group of characters is in constant danger, I usually think repeatedly, \"You\\'re such an idiot, you deserve to be killed.\" But I can\\'t remember thinking that here. Sometimes the characters make mistakes, but, to me at least, they\\'re realistic mistakes that might actually happen in stressful moments.Anyway, it\\'s the rare new series like this one that keeps me from cancelling Netflix.,So we have terrible acting, mainly from the adults, an awful voice over which sounds like something South Park would do, No cliché , trope or stereotype left dragged out, run over then reversed over several times for good measure. Add to this. I have Prosopagnosia, can\\'t recognise faces easily, so pretty much can\\'t tell the characters apart, I genuinely thought one character had been killed off only to see him reappear 2 episodes later talking to the person I though he was.So why is it so good.

When it reaches a good spot, it freezes in place. A stalk slowly grows from its head. The stalk then spews out spores that spread, turning others into zombies.This is no Halloween story about the zombie apocalypse. It\\'s all true. The zombie isn\\'t a human, though. It\\'s an ant. And the stalk that emerges from its head is a fungus. Its spores infect other ants, which lets the zombie cycle begin anew.In order to grow and spread, this fungus must hijack an ant\\'s brain. However weird this might seem, it isn\\'t all that unusual. The natural world is full of zombies under mind control. Zombie spiders and cockroaches babysit developing wasp larvae - until the babies devour them. Zombie fish flip around and dart toward the surface of the water, seeming to beg for birds to eat them. Zombie crickets, beetles and praying mantises drown themselves in water. Zombie rats are drawn to the smell of the pee of cats that may devour them.All of these \"zombies\" have one thing in common: parasites. A parasite lives inside or on another creature, known as its host. A parasite may be a fungus, a worm or another tiny creature. All parasites eventually weaken or sicken their hosts. Sometimes, the parasite kills or even eats its host. But death of the host isn\\'t the freakiest goal. A parasite might get its host to die in a certain place, or be eaten by a certain creature. In order to accomplish these tricks, some parasites have evolved the ability to hack into the host\\'s brain and influence its behavior in very specific ways.How do parasites turn insects and other animals into the walking almost-dead? Every parasite has its own method, but the process usually involves altering chemicals within the victim\\'s brain. Researchers are working hard to identify which chemicals are involved and how they end up so bizarrely altering their host\\'s behavior.Brains, brains! Ant brains!A fungus doesn\\'t have a brain. And worms and single-celled critters obviously aren\\'t very smart. Yet somehow they still control the brains of larger, and smarter, animals.\"It blows my mind,\" says Kelly Weinersmith. She is a biologist who studies parasites at Rice University in Houston, Texas. She is particularly interested in \"zombie\" creatures. True zombies, she points out, aren\\'t exactly like the type you find in horror stories. \"In no way are these animals coming back from the dead,\" she says. Most real zombies are doomed to die - and some have very little control over their actions.The horsehair worm, for instance, needs to emerge in water. To make this happen, it forces its insect host to leap into a lake or swimming pool. Often, the host drowns.Toxoplasma gondii (TOX-oh-PLAZ-ma GON-dee-eye) is a single-celled creature that can only complete its life cycle inside a cat. But first, this parasite must live for a time in a different animal, such as a rat. To ensure this part-time host gets eaten by a cat, the parasite turns rats into cat-loving zombies.In Thailand, a species of fungus - Ophiocordyceps - can force an ant to climb almost exactly 20 centimeters (about 8 inches) up a plant, to face north and then to bite down on a leaf. And it makes the ant do this when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. This provides ideal conditions for the fungus to grow and release its spores.Biologist Charissa de Bekker wants to better understand how that fungus exerts that mind control over the ants. So she and her team have been studying a species related to the Ophiocordyceps fungus in Thailand. This U. S. cousin is a fungus native to South Carolina. It, too, forces ants to leave their colonies and climb. These ants, though, bite down on twigs instead of leaves. This is likely due to the fact that trees and plants in this state lose their leaves in the winter.De Bekker began these studies at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. There, her team infected a few species of ant with the South Carolina fungus. The parasite could kill all of the different ants she introduced to it. But the fungus made plant-climbing zombies only out of the species that it naturally infects in the wild.To figure out what was going on, de Bekker\\'s team collected new, uninfected ants of each species. Then, the researchers removed the insects\\' brains. \"You use forceps and a microscope,\" she says. \"It\\'s sort of like that game Operation.\"The researchers kept the ant brains alive in small Petri dishes. When the fungus was exposed to its favorite brains (that is, ones from the ants that it naturally infects in the wild), it released thousands of chemicals. Many of these chemicals were completely new to science. The fungus also released chemicals when exposed to unfamiliar brains. These chemicals, however, were completely different. The researchers published their results in 2014.The experiments at Penn State by de Bekker\\'s team were the first to create ant zombies in the lab. And the researchers only succeeded after setting up artificial 24-hour cycles of light and darkness for the zombies and their parasites.It will take more work to learn how the parasite\\'s chemicals lead to zombie behavior in ants. \"We are very much in the beginning of trying to figure this out,\" says de Bekker. She now studies ant zombies at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. There, she is now probing how that daily cycle of sunlight and darkness affects zombification.,While I enjoyed shows like squid game and alot of anime you can\\'t get away from the strangest of characters from All of us are Dead, every character is directed to overact their role, from bullies being completely evil, to victims being evil eventually tarring the whole school in revenge, none are really phased with killing & then of course in traditional Korean fashion there\\'s the ridiculous stab at humour, heart felt moments but if they\\'re crying missing loved ones, by the next scene they\\'re making toilet humour, it\\'s too un-human to be a classic, it\\'s confused and tries to achieve everything but eventually achieves an average rating at best, another overly marketed show that suffers from overhype.,I loved this series a thrilling ride to start to finish. I was gripped and loved the characters. The Koreans really are at the top of their game. Hollywood watch out.,I really enjoyed this, and whilst it was obviously about a Zombie outbreak it felt much, much more, with characters I actually cared about.Some comments have said it\\'s just the same as all other S Korean zombie films. Perhaps. But the physicality and action within the school were still ten times better than some of the stuff churned out in the US or Europe.It didn\\'t shirk away from violence and wasn\\'t afraid to kill off key characters - although you could argue it was a bit too keen at times. Maybe some of the side stories didn\\'t really go anywhere, but they at least broke up the main focus so it didn\\'t become too claustrophobic in one location, and even then you felt the whole of the school was utilised to give it a sense of scale.Things I liked:Good charactersGood set pieces and effectsGenuine interest in where the story was goingMain quibbles:The origin story of the virus was a bit ridiculousIs it realistic that the infected would just stay within that specific area and it wouldn\\'t spread further?Apart from the school why are there never zombie children in the streets? (Something in all films to be fair)Probably could have been trimmed down to 10 episodes max.Overall, I thought this was just as good as Squid Game and, in some instances, better.,I avoid trailers nowadays, I check the description, who is in it and who made it and that seems to work for me. I really enjoyed this series, binged with my wife. If ur looking for a good zombie horror action with some kdrama and kquirks this is really good, just note the 1st episode sets up the show so it\\'s abit slow.,Despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and you could really feel their emotions as they make their ways through the endless waves of zombie attacks, dealing with the sadness of losing their friends/loved ones and struggling to stay hopeful in the wake of such dire circumstances.Overall, it was a genuinely enjoyable zombie thriller where you will feel the excitement, laugh and cry together with the students as they fight for survival!,Who doesn\\'t love South Korean zombie productions, \\'uh?This one has a cool overall concept, good visuals and a great atmosphere, with some great action scenes, especially some of the chase scenes with the students...... however, it also has severe flaws that nearly ruin the enjoyment.The pacing is horrible, especially in the first half of the show. The show goes to a crawl in some of the initial episodes. Extremely slow episodes with 1h10 run time is crazy. It also completely goes overboard with the clickity-clack loud sounds on the transformations earlier on, too many, too often, too frequently for too long.I won\\'t go into stupid character decisions as plot devices, or the absurd emotional philosophical talks whilst zombies are about to overrun you, or the fact they repeat the \\'person transforming into zombie in front of you and everyone watches eagerly\\' 3 or 4 times in the first episodes, since it\\'s part of a typical zombie show, those are all \\'acceptable\\' as is.Had this show been properly edited, or cut, with a lower, but more relevant run time, and it would have been a sensational hit. As it is, its actually tough to tolerate the bad, to enjoy the good.I liked the cast, most of them did ok, and hope to see some of them in future shows.,Usually, Korean series are watchable 6s or 7s. This one is not. An amateurish, sloppy and unintelligent string of nonsensical clichés that goes on and on and on ... sheer smother.Redeeming value? Stunt scenes are pretty great, hence 4 stars.,This zombie show definitely has its faults. I was constantly irked or shaking my head or rolling my eyes. Still for everything it does wrong, it does ten other things so right. Above all else, its just plain too fun to hate. I mean its also sad and scary and bloody and all that stuff, but most of all its just fun. Also its very interesting as an American to see some of the sensibilities of youth in Koreas culture. Very different. I need another season right away. So addictive. No matter how silly some of it got, I kept coming back for the characters even though I disliked almost all of them. Very well fleshed out characters. That helps you care about and understand the stakes more. I liked Squid game but this is better definitely.,Well, as a Netflix production, this is way better than this piece of garbage that is Squid Game, (probably because it is based on a webtoon, so they already had the origin material) but I would not call it best tv series of 2022!The characters lack a bit of personality and charisma, and there\\'s unecessary teenage drama too. Most of the characters and events are predictable, there\\'s no surprises.Still, it is a decent show to watch, but I had to fast forward lot of boring stuff.There are way better Korean TV series out there! (Taxi driver, Signal, Hapiness, Sweet Home, Strangers from Hell, Uncanny Counter, Mouse etc...),It\\'s the first zombie series that I\\'ve watched with sufficient amount of time given to explanations about the causes, govt reactions and research. Add to that an effort for the character building, two types of zombies as well as interesting ending.This series is quite unique in that sense, and that\\'s why I am giving it an 8.What I didnt like is generally seen in almost all Korean movies and series: too long stares between actors, their slow reactions, aggresive behaviour of women which are hitting guys all the time for no reason. The way Korean girls run is always clumsy with their hands down. Girls always yell on guys for no reason, they never yell on them etc.There are also some unreasonable things that bothered me, like not looking for food, water nor toilet in days.But all in all, i would recommend this movie to those who specifically like this genre as there are some unique and never-seen before ideas. Hopefully producers of other future zombie movies will pay attention and develop on that, as zombie genre really needs this kind of refreshment, to move away from boring and simplified \\'chase and kill\\' action.,It\\'s a good show. Sometimes too long. Could have been shorter at about 8 episodes. I found myself just forwarding lot of moments and during that nothing happened. Just people watching into each other eyes. And that\\'s a lot of minutes. Sometimes, i questioned a lot of decisions. But reminded myself these are just a bunch of kids who are supposed to be 15-17 years old. In addition, this is happening in an Asian society so a lot of decision makings are just different from kids who are in a western country.The Character developments are okay. We see different types so it\\'ll be easy for people to recognize themselves in the kids.Some comedic moments are added to the show to lighten it. Some scenes are just gore.The ending leaves space for a part 2.Overall it\\'s a good show to watch. Not perfect. But good.,I\\'m very happy to see this have high reviews. I clapped once it finished and thanked the screen. Just all around great. Character development, check. Zombie filled stressful moments, check. I thought it was very neat to have most of it in happen within one location, and all the creative ways these kids, together, stayed alive. It\\'s almost believable and realistic on what it would look like. Explored grief and relationships in a beautiful way. It was longgg, it never seemed too long and the length served the snow. Loved going on this journey with these heroes :),I\\'m about half-way through the season. The show has some flaws, it\\'s not perfect. Nothing is. Expecting this to be a flawless masterpiece is unrealistic and just being an entitled a&&hole.But really, this is a great entry into the zombie canon so far. I think they are doing some really creative things and trying to have some fun at the same time. The pacing is good, the soundtrack is good. They\\'re thinking big-picture about some of the problems that would be encountered and totally Train to Busan-ing ways to solve those problems.Yes, characters sometimes make stupid decision. But honestly, is it realistic for high school kids in \"real life\" to suddenly become apocalypse masterminds as soon as zombies prove to be real and start attacking? Would it be realistic for everyone, even adults, to know the perfect strategy and what to do every time in an intense situation like this? C\\'mon. Gimme a break.Of course they\\'re not always going to do the smart thing. That\\'s called being a teenager. That\\'s called being HUMAN.This show is taking a balls-to-the-wall stab at doing some fresh with the genre while still respecting the canon that\\'s come before. It\\'s fun to watch. It\\'s also got emotional depth and some real to say under it all.Watch it, eat some popcorn.,Did you expect some kind of new twist on Zombies? Did you expect the stupidity of Zombie of the dead? Its bloody and violent. Its everything you want in a zombie show. Stop complaining and expecting originality in a world where there is none. Just enjoy it.,Going into it i was really not sceptical as the series was 12 episodes (each episode having 45+ runtime), and the series does lag in the middle but at the end its a good series. Acting is not bad , zombies are part we seen before and part new things. Worth a watch go for it if you have time. After watching this i really miss the series named \\' Sweet Home \\' which i hope Netflix renews for a new season .,Ok, it\\'s not the \\'Train to Busan stopping first at high school\\' that I had hoped it would be but I quite enjoyed it. It might benefit from there being a bit of a lull in good stuff being released right now though(?).It basically follows the progress of a couple of groups of kids (most focus being on the the one, larger group) as they try to escape the zombie infested high school.Along the way, stuff happens - some more interesting than others, some of it is really quite stupid and there are times when I felt like switching off but am glad I didn\\'t. The first episode or two in particular are a bit... iffy...Watch it expecting a Young Adult horror series and you\\'ll enjoy it more than if you go into it expecting it to be outright horror.,I\\'m halfway through episode 2 and over it. I enjoy a good zombie movie, but I\\'m tired of watching the same boring tropes. I was really hoping this could be different, but alas, it\\'s all the same. Good production value can\\'t overcome horrible scriptwriting, plot holes, and annoying characters. I\\'m sure this is a teenager\\'s wet dream, but I can already feel my brain cells screaming in agony.What\\'s with the bone cracking?? The inconsistent turn rates? There are students running around outside, yet no one thinks to run out of the school gates? We watch one short scene with the principal and that\\'s it... wtf happened to the staff? Does this school not own an office with phones? Don\\'t the classrooms have phones?? Where are the police? In the \"real world,\" rational people are fighting to survive- not mooning over their crush, calling each other \"c*$ksucker\" (that gem came from a teacher to a student), or standing around wondering HOW to kill these things when \"Train to Busan\" is clearly referenced several times.I literally cannot fathom sitting through 10 more hours of this, especially if the origin story is of Dad of the Year injecting his bullied son with a homemade recipe for revenge. What a disappointment- for once I\\'d love to see a total overhaul of the genre. I\\'m reminded of how I felt seeing the Matrix back in 99... it was new and exciting. I havent watched \"Train to Busan\" yet, but hope that it will restore some faith in zombies again.,Its an averge teen zombie series the only thing special about this one is the action scene in 1st and 2nd episode its filming really well .. after that is gets bad .............,I won\\'t write too much about this drama. The acting is decent. The script is OK - if you\\'re watching with English dub, and the direction and editing are worthy of note but, at the end of the day, this is just another example of a production attempting to instill the idea that humans are violent.Episode 4 spells it out, without trying to hide it.Humans are inherently bad, so life without a governing body is wrought with danger.Whatever happened to the idea - possibly born in the 60\\'s, or earlier - that humanity is inherently good?There are only a very small minority who find satisfaction in causing harm to the rest. Most humans would rather love their neighbour, not hate.Good idea for a show, if you\\'re not bored with zombies, but we should all long for the day when writers realise that the public are not idiots, who fall for the idea that every human has evil at heart. Or is this just an attempt to make every human evil, whether they intend to be or not?It isn\\'t just Hollyweird trying this approach, apparently.Try harder, Korea. You may find social realism - i.e. Actual social realism - more rewarding for the audience.,With any zombie movie or drama, you accept the basic premise of a fictious life form that does things that are unreal. However, it does get frustrating when the show is filled with unrealistic human behavior. The zombie outbreak at the school starts with a girl opening a cage that was rattling. I had a sense of deja vu since another zombie show, Kingdom, had two people fighting to the death, but stopping suddenly to open a rattling crate, which let out the... zombie... Are there that many people in this world who cannot resist opening something that rattles? Please, please... If you hear suspicious rattling from a box or crate, call the authorities or move away from it. Do NOT open the damn box!!!,Recently South-Korea seems to be on a zombie streak. This has come with some great hits (Train to Busan and Kingdom) and some terrible misses. Unfortunately this show is more miss than hit.The first half of the show holds its own, as character deaths are swift and believable. The engine is chugging with proper tension, low on melodramatic scenes.Unfortunately the second half of the show, especially after the reveal of the halfbies, is rife with melodramatic scenes and long drawn out shots trying desperately to make the viewer sad. Very cheap tactics are used multiple times. (Parents of girl X die, mother of boy Y dies, and father of girl Z dies.)Another disappointment is the asymptomatic angle. It is never explored further than to find a tactic to lure zombies with high pitch noise. The last we see of the second halfbie is the lab being wiped clean.Initially I thought the halfbie angle could be interesting but it is never properly explored, except to serve us a recurring 80\\'s Hollywood enemy. In the end I think they should have toned down the halfbie angle and gone with a more interesting approach of how to deal with asymptomatic carriers. It had a lot of potential.Unfortunately a lot of potential was wasted and there\\'s no coming back from these choices in a potential season 2. I\\'ll be waiting for the next season of Kingdom.4/10.,Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead. Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.,Only on episode 3 and already hooked this is brilliant.Everything is so good about this show. Its so freaking scary love it!This show is so good that anyone who likes horror should watch it.,The show is intense but still has humor. Not as dark as the Kingdom, but intense enough for a zombie show. I think it is the only zombie show that looks so much into the humanity and relationship, and social problems. So in that sense, it is quite soft, not as hardcore as the Kingdom.,I really enjoyed this for the most part - there\\'s a lot of originality in a theme that\\'s been done a lot, the acting was often good, the action sequences amazing, but then there\\'ll be a really crap line, or some insanely dumb decision that makes you cringe.I\\'d probably have rated it a little lower for those negatives, but hey, I live in the UK, so I\\'m well aware how dumb some decisions can be in real life, so they\\'re not unrealistic, just a bit annoying.,Not sure how this got 7.7.It\\'s not \"that bad\" but it\\'s also not very good either. Everything gets very repetitive and/or very ridiculous VERY quickly, and this is someone that stuck with the dumpster fire TWD until the end.This review is totally ignoring how the writers chose at PURE WILL to FIT THEIR MEDIOCRE scripts just how long it takes to turn into a zombie after being bitten. 5 seconds? Yeah sure, if it fits the script. 5 minutes? Yeah sure, if it fits the script and the person bitten needs to give an emotional goodbye,Not a terrible show, not a very good one either.,Perfect? No, but def worth a watch, kinda addfictive.Zombies are very cool and scary, feel like Train to Busan zombies. I really don\\'t understand why some people complain about them.Characters: they are many of them, some are more likable than others. What is nice is we never know who will die or not ; sometime a character got a big story but then die right after, sometime a \\'\\'secondary\\'\\' character (at first) will become important. So it\\'s stressful when they are under attack, because we really don\\'t know who will survive. Yea sometime they die in some weird/dumb way, but it would happen in a real zombie invasion. It\\'s not alway super cool and heroic in my opinion.I don\\'t agree when people complain that some characters just stand here and don\\'t move. It\\'s possible to be shocked when your best friend or dad or mom turn into a zombie. Not sure if you would do better, really.Perhap a bit too much teen drama for my taste, I was a bit annoyed at episode 7-8-9, but it\\'s ok. I kind of agree that the serie could have been like 10 epiodes instead of 12.Not a fan of the pseudo intellectual jaded ideas of \\'\\'humanity is evil, bad so they deserve it\\'\\' and stuff.A good 8/10 for sure, try it.,Boring stuff and lame stories don\\'t get better if you produce them in South Korea! Mix some Teenage highscool crap stories with a virus and let them all get zombies. Zzz! The story is told a thousand times the last 10 years in roundabout a 100 zombie series. Why stupid humans need another one? I am really sick and tired of Netflix. They are so predictable. Show one series out of South Korea, see that it is successful, buy a thousand lame series more from South-Korea and hope they get hyped the same way. Nope thats not how it goes!,My expectation for the show was higher than what it turned out to be. The storyline was good, however, felt like it way too stretched that it should\\'ve been. The reason to create that virus that made the people zombie was that satisfactory. This shows the cruelty the victims face from the people they expect to aid them. The romance they tried to create in this show was not something appreciative at all. As the romance was not even a bit exciting all along the show. You can watch it if you have time it\\'s a mid tier apocalyptic show.The ending was a cliffhanger and it was a nice exciting one hopefully they can bring out the next season and make it a good one. However, my expectations are not that high as I don\\'t think there can be something more added to make the story better.,I stopped watching american zombie dramas and their other dramas, since they always include unnecessary adult scenes, sxx, etc. So happy i found korean dramas.I would give a 10 if only cheong san ending is different. This young actor is very good. They better bring him back in season 2.However other than that, the drama dan the ending is very satisfying.,I like how Korean filmmakers always give fresh ideas. Since the era of Train to Busan, Korean zombie-themed shows, although not very developed, at least show new situations like this series. There may have been many teenage romance dramas at school, but you may not have found teenage romance dramas at school in the mid of a zombie outbreak situation before this series.,Very entertaining, the cinematography is pretty good and there were a lot of nice shots\\r\\nThe plot is very interesting, for once the main characters are not adults but young students so it was nice seeing a different point of view.Amazing the relationship between the characters, even if it is a series about survival and zombies it goes deep in the emotions of the characters, hope they\\'ll make a second season cause I\\'d like to see more of them.,To be honest I was not really interested about starting a series about zombies, the entire concept has been so dragged out that it starts feeling stale. There always are exceptions with ridiculously funny Zombieland and masterfully directed Train to Busan( which is by far my favourite zombie movie).For a series the 1 hour mark was daunting for me as an hour is almost half the runtime of a movie. But after the 1st episode I was hooked so if you are scared of the runtime don\\'t worry if you finish the 1st episode you\\'ll want to watch the next and then next. It however feels like a commitment.The story as we can except from a kdrama was top notch, except the ending. The motivation was spot on for the development of the zombie virus( not a spoiler as that\\'s how it\\'s). Though the science behind it I\\'m a little iffy about it, however emotionally it made sense. The friendships throughout the series were so good like there was a rollercoaster of emotions involved. An irritating villain who just keeps coming back. The heartlessness of people we have to depend upon, and the will to survive. I wanna make a special note that the romance is so adorable and beautiful that you want to protect all of the ships but the world it\\'s set-up is so cruel that you end up broken anyways. Which brings me to the ending, as the show came to a close certain deaths seemed like they just happened to be killed to attain a certain route without any development which made those deaths cheap. Also after such a harrowing experience, you\\'d expect a good/wholesome ending but even that was stripped from us, so basically PAIN + PAIN.Characters were amazingly written. Like always whenever a zombie movie starts you bey on who\\'s gonna survive, I did that too. Most of my guesses were right but I was surprised to see which one of them. As i have said you\\'ll feel the beautiful friendships, you\\'ll feel the romance which then will intensify the pain. Although certain characters were so useless that they just randomly died and no one from the cast seemed to care later. I found it funny and as a glitch as all the characters were saying they gotta be like a family. So that\\'s a negative. Some moves weren\\'t very logical and I should expect that with zombie movies but when other aspects are so good you end up expecting more. Like there\\'s a scene where a laptop is supposed to be procured it was alright but it had unnecessary tension build up. After that scene we got into the human emotions stuff and that made me forget that scene. But still.Sound design is very well. The way background music can convert a scene from terrifying in a moment to comedy is pretty good. Music plays amazing role in the emotions that we see on screen. Romance, comedy, horror, friendship, sadness, despair everything.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to watch this series, it took me about 2 days to finish it but you can finish it in one. The end is unsatisfactory but you\\'ll still enjoy it. Hope a sequel is released ( which probably will not since it\\'s a Korean series which are mostly limited).Thanks for reading. See you later✌,Just finished watching this series and wow.I love Korean products that talk about zombies, this amazed me, it was a mix of emotions. I laughed, cried, screamed, felt sorry for the characters, got upset about some adult choices, and empathized totally with them.I find it a fantastic product, the relationships between people and the reactions they have really amazed me.I hope a sequel comes out, I want to see them again.,Those korean kids acts like they have some kind of retardation themselves. It is too far from reality. I know, zombies are far as well, however it is about them before turning into zombies. My god, they do absurd things, when they are trying too much scaping from zombies is ridiculous, they go out the building go back inside, no one even tries to scape from there.The drama itself do not convincing anyone. What I observed: they are smarter when they get infected, what is hilarious, I do not know how young Koreans are actualy, but if they are like that then South Korea has dark times upcoming. The scenes, their decisions, everything is a lame in this terrible series. I think if there is some screenwriter that is an idiot, ok. But there are: producers, directors and actors themselves. How, in this world that could be convincible? HOW in this world? I fear that from few years ago to the future, the cinema is not an art anymore it is just a bunch of crazy inflated egos trying to do over and over the samep s..t.,I\\'d love to give this series an 8 or more. It had potential. Unfortunately, nearly every decision the characters make is beyond stupid. They all deserve to die. And multiple people should be fired... director, producers, writers.,Stupid character decisions ruin shows. In this one for example they all know what zombies are and they even reference Train to Busan. So why on earth wouldn\\'t they try to armour themselves up, like wrap their arms and legs with books, get some sharp objects as weapons, stop yelling unnecessarily, stop trying to prevent people from killing bitten people etc.Nam-ra\\'s character was annoying and I don\\'t know why they made her the focus. The dads plotline was also pointless.There\\'s many storylines that were unnecessary or frustrating like the bully that kept falling from the building. The zombie human girl should havr also been going around and stabbing all the zombies one by one and clearing out areas before the rest moved out. Missed opportunity and they didn\\'t have the best strategies. That final zombie battle out in the open with spades was also super ridiculous and stupid decision making. The writers should have made them at least take high ground.Oh yeah also why wouldn\\'t the archery students be collecting their arrows as much as possible. They need all the arrows they can get. They would have used the arrows and gone around stabbing the zombies one by one through the tennis cage or something like that. Like daryl did in the walking dead. So many missed opportunities that zombie lovers would have wanted to see.,3 episodes in and I\\'m waiting to give a crap about any of these characters. None of them are likeable, or particularly smart or clever. The perfect show to watch while on your phone.,Happiness (2021) is also a Zombie Kdrama, except it\\'s not. It focuses on the human aspect of survival in a way to try and present itself as unique. It tries to show us that humans are worse than zombies, except the writing is absolute garbage because the basis of each episode is a character making a dumb decision and then the two main protagonists having to fix that dumb decision. That is not how you create plot! That show falls into every zombie pitfall trope possible.Now All os Us are dead on the other hand is amazing. If you want to see how cruel humans can actually be to one another, this is the show, especially after episode 3. Good cast of characters, great action, great plot, great sfx makeup and average cinematography. However if you\\'re watching this show for film making techniques you\\'ve come to the wrong place.,South Korea has disappointed us. I do not know if this is called a comedy or horror series or thriller but whatever it is, it is a disaster. Destruction.,I\\'m not sure what people who are calling this mediocre are talking about..the writing and production were on target, and the acting was great. I liked the ending. Definitely recommend.,Definitely a big series. 12 episodes with 1 hour each = 12 hours of time.....\\r\\nI did it split it into 3 days to see and eventually it was released during the weekend.As usual Zombie base concept but the modus operandi of the point of creation was different. The concious Zombie concept which is an inspiration from \"Zack Snyders - The Army of the Dead\". This consious Zombies are really a different kind in the script and does create good value to the usual story.The names were really tough to go through atleast for the 5 or 6 episodes and after several deaths, I can remember the last batch of 8 names. Just for fun - Nam Ra, Haeyuk, Chiang, Yong Sue and many moreeeeeee...There was more fun involved as well like the youtuber,the policman and the leg injured guy.The deaths of the well developed characters are expected always - that will be the weseries trend for the past years.The ending again leaves lead to part two and as usual I do wait for the nexr season. But I hardly wish 40 mins * 6/8 episodes with a gripping play - definetely dont want 12 hours of running time.,One of the recent Korean productions quickly positioned itself among the most popular in Mexico. I already know why. It starts as \"Zombie Station\" (also Korean) and ends as \"RBD\" (typical Mexican teen drama soap opera).What a big disappointment and what a waste of time after chapter 2!The pace of the script is truly stressful, something that should be caused by the zombie chases and the inevitable spread of the virus.The characters live between regrets, like teenagers, but even adults behave as if they were incapable of having developed emotional intelligence. So many tears distract them from the need to strategize, strengthen alliances, and basically run away instead of mindlessly fighting monsters.It is not a dystopian world, they well know that zombies die with the destruction of the brain and go to war like cavemen with stones and sticks.Something that really bothers me is the denial of science, from the fact that a resentful teacher can create a virus in his room without the rigor of a laboratory, to the lack of contagion patterns... some of them reach superpowers and others simply run to bite whoever they catch.The story provokes in the viewer the constant desire that everyone die for idiots! They all deserve to die.Netflix invested a lot of money in digital production and post-production, they would have paid better writers instead.In other hand, it is a good portrait of school violence. Many of the problems that occur in history are rooted in abuses of power, bad influences, and inequities between social classes. There are many examples of social degradation, such as \"Lord of the Flies\" or \"The Beach\".It started with five stars but in the end it only deserves three.,I can\\'t believe how good this series turned out to be.I love zombie movies/series but in recent years, my standards got to a very low level, as there were not many good contents in this type.All of Us Are Dead proved, that if they want, they can absolutely put together a show full of excitement.It was fast paced, exciting and emotional from the beginning til the end. If you are a zombie fanatic, you definitely should watch this.Sure, there were some mistakes and errors, but which undead movie doesn\\'t?,\\'All of us are dead\\' is the latest Korean sitting on top in Netflix shows which have been dominated by Koreans for a couple of months in most countries. Whether you are familiar with K-drama or you are just getting to know about it after the #squidgame pandemic and giving it a chance just like me, this show has so much to tell. The plot is not perfect and has a lot of holes in it that some of it will be probably answered in next season, however, for someone with a lot of Zombie movies, shows, and games experience, the characters seemed a bit stupid at the start, some of the deaths are badly written. But when you stop comparing them to let\\'s say badass characters of other shows like #Thewalkingdead, they seem a lot more realistic. So bear that in mind that these characters are just a bunch of high school kids with no experience or proper weapon at hand. The story starts with a virus outbreak in a high school and covers a lot of different characters without a leading role. With all the explanations \\'All of us are dead\\' has a messy but proper and thrilling plot. The casting is good. I believe that most of the actors & actresses are new faces but they did the job quite well. CG and computer effects are good mostly but in a few scenes, it\\'s not very clean. The soundtracks and sound effects are good and it brings a sense of fear to the show. The opening is one of the positive points and it\\'s innovative.Overall, \\'all of us are dead\\' is a brutal and thrilling zombie show with an acceptable plot and good choice of cast. If you are looking for a fun zombie show that tastes like K-drama, it can be a good choice for you.,This show brings absolutely nothing new to the zombie genre and falls for all the same pitfalls zombie movies from 2002 fell for.Zombies in drama teenage school with a little bit of bullying undertone but nothing ever feels like a _complete story_.It\\'s just a string of events and 1 dimensional comic book-like characters who serve exactly one purpose: the sad girl, the maniac bully, the fat kids who loves chicken. It\\'s almost satire.Entertaining background noise but I can\\'t help to think - was this conjured by an AI?,Is this a great zombie outbreak show? Yes. Is it plauged by the occasional cheesy comic relief cliches at points? Also Yes. But this show goes so much further than that. In the end it\\'s less about the zombies and more about the horrific trauma the outbreak inflicts on everyone involved. It shows the perspective of survivors as well as rescuers and military. No one is spared from the effects of this nightmare and nothing is black and white. It\\'s honestly tough to watch at times and nauseating to see what these people have to go through, but it\\'s refreshing in the sense that it isn\\'t just a mindless hack and slash zombie flick and actually deals with tragedy as well as moral and ethical dilemmas. Highly Recommend.,My family and I really enjoyed this show. It was good from start to finish! Better than stupid Walking Dead that dragged on for years. Make a good series and know when to end it.,Started promising but I would have switched off after episode 4 if it wasn\\'t for my partner who wanted to finish it.Turns out we needn\\'t have bothered. There must have been 3-4 episodes where nothing happens and they just move about from room to room making the same mistakes. Infuriating.Zero payoff at the end too.,Good premises of a zombie apocalypse setup. Generally good acting but the whole coming-of-age mixed in really dragged down the show.It\\'s zombie apocalypse we do not have time for young brats\\' love quarrel and other emotional stupidity. Many parts we fast-forwaded to skip the boring cheesy moment that are suppose to be emotional. They felt completely out of place. Lot of sub-plots were not done in enough details and felt like just fillers.And I meant it is a zombie apocalypse show we are not expecting it to be 100% realistic, but when you have the main casts happily chatting with each other after two-three days of no water and food, zombies suddenly chase flare for no reason, and certain roles took forever to fully turn into zombie after being bitten, you know something is wrong about the script.,I liked Train to Busan so when they said that a new Korean zombie show was coming out I was really excited. The trailer looked good and I\\'m for TV series over movies to tell a big story all day any day. I thought it was cool that they had some scientific explanations for the zombie outbreak and not just \"it started\". It was also cool to have 12 hours to cover surviving a zombie apocalypse rather than 2 in a movie. But the show really fell flat.For starters, the plot was really ridiculous at times. The virus origin story was just \"what\"? So the teacher\\'s son was bullied, and instead of protecting him, moving him to another school, finding ways to prove the bullies\\' guilt, using his status as a teacher to push for punishment, signing him up for self defense classes and basically everything rational... he injects his son with a new virus he just created? I\\'m impressed he was able to contain his son and wife at home without getting hurt himself btw. Then when the virus broke out his actions were really inconsistent. He was agitated at first when finding out that the student he chained up was released. But then he took centuries to explain everything. Also he sent the cop to his computer to retrieve the solution when it was just \"burn them all\"? I was really hoping this character would be developed and utilized more, since the scientific side of a zombie virus is pretty interesting and would\\'ve separated this series from other zombie shows.Moving on, the characters that we follow are mostly not very likable. There were some actors that were horendous at acting too. Zombie in your face and these kids just poker face... I get that these kids are just teenagers, but it\\'s a zombie apocalypse, one of the kids actually mentioned Train to Busan in episode 1 or sth, lets get to work with building up defenses, armoring up, finding resources, figuring out what\\'s going on outside... can we save the meaningless squabbles and love triangle drama for later? The kids also act very dumb at times. Can we throw an infected person out of the room before they actually become a zombie and get another person bitten? Yes I can imagine it being tough when it\\'s a friend or family, but sometimes they really go over the top with it and just makes the characters seem stupid and irrational. Neither the protagonists nor the antagonists were particularly well written, and I can\\'t help feeling that the writer had something against women in general. I get that Asia\\'s gender expectations are more traditional, but most of the females just cowered behind while the guys did all the work. Like seriously? You need the guys to tell you to help them push and not just sit behind and watch?Half way through the series become more about the conscious \"half zombies\" than the rabid thrashing ones, which is okay, but the subplots were quite underwhelming too. The bully\\'s obsessed with the male lead. The bullied girl decides that the person she wants to avenge the most is... the guy that tried to comfort her at the rooftop? Class president gained these super powers and couldn\\'t die anymore... and she couldn\\'t do anything to help? Like go out, find a safe path, find food & water? It\\'s like having Spiderman with an invisibility buff on your team and he does almost nothing. They spent half an episode on making toilets, a much more mundane matter that nobody asked for.I wanted to like the series. I really did. I watched it as soon as it came out, but in the end it was kind of underwhelming. It wasn\\'t terrible, it was a thrill to watch people run away from the zombies, but many of the times when they weren\\'t actively fighting or escaping the zombies ended up pretty frustrating.,The series wasn\\'t toooo bad but it could\\'ve been done in eight parts instead of twelve. At the midpoint it started dragging on way too much first with the group assembling in the choir room lamenting and arguing, then the roof for two episodes, lamenting and arguing, then we got a little action as they moved from the roof to the closet in the gym, and we had to spend time with them crying, lamenting and arguing some more for an episode and a half. Looord snooze fest. As diverse and fleshed out as the main characters were they weren\\'t all that likable or interesting. I loved when they shared a candy bar in the closet as if they hadn\\'t eaten in weeks when only 24 hours had gone by since the infection started.Then the one antagonist kept getting pushed out windows and pushed off the roof and then he kept coming back so that plot point got a little stale. I think if I had zombie superpowers the last thing I would care about is my missing eye and getting revenge for it. After all, his body was crunched, twisted, bit, smashed, mashed... he looked like hell so why was he worried about his eye for?I think this would\\'ve been a lot better if they had only trimmed the melodramatic repetitive fat and kept it to six episodes.Anywho...,It started out nice. But then... firstly, I would cut the number of episodes down to just 8. And one episode should be 45 minutes long, max. The cinematography was great, Koreans are masters in this stuff. But what in the hell were the dialogues about? I\\'ll tell you: absolutely nothing! I watched the version with Korean audio and English subtitles so MAYBE a lot got lost in the translation? But still... it was painful to watch. It went on and on and on... was it a zombie horror? Teen drama? None. It was like creators couldn\\'t decide.,Imo I thought the first episode was a bit slow to get to the zombie outbreak and boy was I happy when it did.I find how the virus was made a little interesting, nothing mind blowing, but interesting. I think the only thing that gets me are the points where the writing is dumbed down so the plot can move forward. The best moment I can think of is when a kid calls the authorities. I sat there and repeated \"please don\\'t be stupid and say \"zombies are attacking students at my school\".\" and then the student brings up Train to Busan, which you should watch if you haven\\'t yet. So far this is a good zombie series.Some points off for writing and pacing but still good.,Such great action and suspense! I absolutely loved how nail biting, exciting and fast paced the show was. I wrote that this show is so stressful that it distracts you from a lot of the character writing issues. I had previously written how the teenagers and adults alike frequently made such selfish choices that it felt unbelievable. I frequently was yelling at the screen wondering why would you do that in a literal life or death zombie apocalypse situation??? Like their choices just didn\\'t seem realistic for this high stake scenario. But then I learned more about the sewol ferry accident and the depressing truth is that the choices of the adults accurately reflect reality. May those left behind Rest In Peace and I commend the show for touching on such a series topic.,I found myself loving the kindhearted and despising the nasty characters. I have to attribute the realness of everything to the superb acting of the young actors in this movie. Every character is complex in their own way.This is not just a zombie movie, but.in some ways a coming of age story for the young characters. Everyone seems to mature in some way.A well put together story and I just had to keep watching!This is definitely not just about zombies! :),This is patchy but intriguing. It has some of the most horrific Zombie moments without having to go full Walking Dead gore fest. For the me most interesting aspects were the traditional Korean cultural values (especially family) juxtaposed to what we see in western versions of this genre. My hero was the commander - his medical protocol Vs family (in the age of COVID) was a better take than shows like Contagion.,One of the best Zombie series I have seen.. I don\\'t know why some give negative reviews.. Seriously what you guyzz expect in zombie series???emotional scenes are good.. Zombie scenes nice... I could rate 10/10.,I don\\'t know why, but this keeps entering my dreams.Unlike the walking dead series, this was actually going towards a direction.I wouldn\\'t watch it if it was not a mini series. Nonetheless, the terror they could put with the zombies worth a mindful exploration, surrounded with Korean cinematography is entertaining to keep watching.,In the beginning, good zombie action and students working together, but then around episode 4 just got really boring, by episode 9 I was just saying \"come on, rap this up\",Over all show was ok. Too long. Characters kind of doing the same thing over and over again, episode after episode. Started out ok as things fall apart. Decent stories on the people involved. Really started to drag about half way. Too many repeat battles with the main antagonist. Srsly? Ending couple of episodes were a bit better than the middle episodes. I think this genre has gone on a little too long.,All of us are dead is extremely graphic and disturbing than you may expect. Squeamish people... don\\'t even try. People who want an edge-of-the-seat entertainment and can handle lavish gore... you guys are in for a ride.Each episode delivers and even though they\\'re a bit longer than usual, they don\\'t feel tedious. When there\\'s no mayhem, there are the character conflicts, thus making every episode as gripping as possible.The characters are horror flick typical but they\\'re smart and resourceful- okay maybe some foolish decisions here and there but hey they\\'re still high school students! Seeing them come up with clever escape gimmicks is always the most fun part, as well as seeing them build trust between each other.Cinematography is fine with some striking and ominous frame shots. Sound effects are impressive and detailed (with lots and lots of squelching lol). And the zombie transformation scenes - no matter how repetitive they get - always look pretty insane!The cast are fantastic and everyone shines. I love that they\\'re actually young actors cast as high schoolers (Hollywood take some notes!).Overall, All of us are dead succeeds at being grim, comedic, and emotional all at the same time. Definitely a neat addition to the zombie/survival genre. Looks like another Netflix hit from South Korea.8/10 worth the 12 hours.TW: Bullying / Sexual harassment / Suicide.,The character is not special enough to like.-For me, the atmosphere in the movie is not attractive, maybe the length is too long.-There are a lot of scenes that are a bit awkward.-There are a lot of boring dialogues.Old content but not more advanced.-Quite long for entertainment.*Other than that, the action scenes are fine.,It\\'s the first time I am going to write a review without finishing a season of a series but this deserves it! If you are a zombie fan then stop reading and start watching! It is amazing it has everything you want - lots of action, gore, likable characters and hundreds of zombies..I don\\'t want this season to finish! Well done Netflix bring more series like this!,First you run, then you hide and you fight.Great zombies story, with a beginning very well written..Too much drama I guess, but it\\'s a corean thing..,Series was great till middle and I was hooked.. and then episode 8 came and the director took us all for stupid and ruined it. I get it you want to have 12 episode but why ruin it?,If u are expecting it to be like kingdom or train to busan. Then this is not it. Storyline\\' s a bit mundane, some actings are -meh-. Reviewers here are smitten by the cute Koreans actors period and nothing more. So expect bias reviews and \"don\\'t listen to hater\" quotes used. SIMPS reviews are not actual reviews so do yourself a favour don\\'t waste bingeing this series like I did. You are better off re watching the other awesome zombie series/movies.,I had a blast watching this! It\\'s not groundbreaking or bringing anything new to the table. At its core, this is a story about friendship and family. There were some really heartwarming and gut wrenching scenes. It did get very formulaic at times - reach x checkpoint, something happens, then reach y checkpoint, but overall it was a really fun watch.,3 episodes in, I have to say I\\'m enjoying it.Yes it\\'s not perfect at all;\\r\\nwhenever someone is transforming in a zombie, people just stare and stay still. While there\\'s enough time to take action like throw him/her out of a window or bash its skull. Rather than doing that they just watch and start running when the zombie has fully transformed. I could understand that the first time. But after the same person has seen more than 10 zombie \\'transformations\\', and still does not take action and is surprised the zombie then launches at them, you start to wonder how stupid they actually are...CGI doesn\\'t look to good when there is action involved like a zombie launching itself at someone.Saying that, I have to admit really enjoying this show. It\\'s well acted, well written, sometimes even original and overall it\\'s just tons of fun.A solid 7 for me.,I don\\'t understand all the bad ratings, I really liked it. Some characters not so much, but in general I really liked it. It was entertaining and comical.,I like Korean horror films but this series is kind of lazy. Fast zombies, frantic action, some good gore, but then it\\'s just more but slightly different. Some of the slower scenes were scarier by far.And I like an honest answer to this. Do Korean schools have that serious a bullying problem??!! That was a f-ed up. Seriously. The adults too. Wth.The few things that gave a glimpse in Korean culture are always appreciated. The school itself was kind if interesting and reminded me a little of when I visited a Japanese elementary school.Bottom line - It was fun for a while and then I just stopped watching early in episode 3. More of the same.,The level of violence and the evil nature of the kids might be more than I could deal with. Truly some of the worst kids I\\'ve ever seen.I love horror movies and nothing much puts me off, except this show definitely takes the cake.Not for the faint of heart.,Seriously guys if your going to get paid to write a review by Netflix at least give it a 8. People giving this a 10 is the most ridiculous thing ever.. it\\'s ok I guess maybe because I watched the English dubbed version they may have screwed it up or made it corny on purpose I\\'m not sure.. giving this a 10 is actually insulting too people who read reviews to be honest.,I\\'m so glad that i got to watch such an amazing zombie series. The best part is that they didn\\'t left any loose ends and explained the reason and cause everything very smoothly. And the scenes were too reall i binged watched it and it felt like I\\'m with those school students .Plus they highlighted the fact of bullying and reality of society, first squid game, then hellbound and then All of us are dead. I\\'m looking forward to it\\'s season 2.,Like Squid Game, this series weaves in South Korean discontent.Rich kids vs Welfare kid.Class struggles.Government Oppression - Martial Law, etc.And, of course, bullying.I got laughter out of the Translation to English.It\\'s funny to listen to English dialogue that was dubbed based on what the Koreans think Americans want to hear - especially the girls.I give this a 5... right down the middle.Squid Game is better.,This show is entertaining but full of completely nonsense and absurd choices by the characters. Things no one ever would do if they were in that situation. I almost stopped watching when 2 characters decide to have an emotional conversation as the zombies are seconds away from getting in the room.It\\'s things like that that kill the feeling of urgency of a show.,Pilot was very weak I must say But show picks up pace in completely contrasting fashion from second episode and depicts almost everything a lover for zombie shows wants.But it\\'s NOT for you if you can\\'t stand Gore at all.Well obviously you can\\'t compare it to \\'The Walking Dead\\' but they have done a very good job.So if you love zombie shows, give it a shot one episode beyond the pilot.,I am 22 years old. I grew up with Dawn of the Dead, and I must say, this show is far better. It\\'s like taking a bland dish and adding the right spices to it to make an even better dish; sorry DOTD fans, I still love DOTD, but it\\'s no longer my favorite apocalypse film; it will go down in history as the best of it\\'s time.I am a huge fan of the Beastars. Just an FYI, I know that this film takes place in Korea while the Beastars Netflix Series takes place in Japan, but the High School setting; the mystery theme of who or what is behind a killing, the character\\'s voices/mannerisms and even their uniform remind me of the Beastars; the hero dude Cheogsan who has a secret crush on Onjo reminds me of Legoshi and Haru for instance.This is hands down the BEST zombie-apocalypse movie-series of all time. I call it a movie series because the episodes are like movie segments, that really don\\'t feel like they\\'re a hour long. It\\'s absolutely hilarious too. I\\'ve so far watched 3 episodes. I would hate to spoil it for those who want to see a Sci-Fi masterpiece that still managed to be original. The character arcs are gripping, and you grow an attachment to the main characters really quickly.Since it\\'s full of gore, I\\'d say it\\'s best fit for ages 17 and up.In many ways, the zombie-virus reminds me of COVID, but is way worse than covid; Contagion\\'s virus was eerily just like coronavirus too, but again not as terrifying as the one on this show. Made me think, \"Maybe Covid isn\\'t so bad,\" and the importance of our modern-day technology!The animation is intense, so-much-so that you forget this is just a movie. If you watch it long enough, you actually start to feel there; the makeup and animation is simply so compelling. Immediately, when you begin to watch it, you\\'re HOOKED. You\\'ll feel empathy, fear, suspense, and amusement AT ONCE. Every single character on here is interesting and talented; both the actors on the screen, and the voice-over actors; you can\\'t even tell that it\\'s a voice over, and I really had to study their lip movements, which still seem to be in sync; you seriously WON\\'T notice it very much at all.You\\'ll be determined to see what happens to all of them, and if they make it out because the title itself just draws people in. It is brilliant. Every single shot and angle is perfectly paced in line with the story. I never feel like characters stall or are dragging the time, like I\\'ve seen with even some Disney+ Originals; move aside Disney and take some notes, because Netflix Originals did it AGAIN with another masterpiece.It is bound to jerk some tears of sadness or shock, or make you cry laughing. You seriously can\\'t get bored with this one - even I can\\'t and I am attention-deficient. This is definitely binge-watchable if you can stomach the realisticness of the gore and suspense. Sometimes I even forgot that the characters can\\'t hear me through the screen when they\\'re unbeknowst of a zombie\\'s approaching. I can see why this made the top 10, but this baby could go in a top 3 tier list. I have yet to find something that comes as close to it!,Although there are some logical mistakes I love it. Friendship relationship , actors and actress , generally vibes from the series are amazing. Looks like put really huge amount of money on production. One of the main reason to love Korean series.,That\\'s right. If you\\'re a teenager or have a teenager IQ for movies. This ones for you and most movies out there.Disappointing but didn\\'t expect too much. Dialogue is simple. Yes the culture is diff than America or Europe but story is relatable. Some really terrible emotional scenes for characters that are almost adults. It\\'s really a waste of time after the 3rd episode. I wasted my time cuz I was in a snowpocalypse for 2 days. It\\'s a very frustrating to watch, characters are dull, slow at times and plenty of rip off zombie scenes.,\"Zombies are done, there\\'s nothing left to explore. I\\'m gonna watch this, only for the gore and make-up effects. I guess I\\'m interested in how they portray the zombies, also, I need to kill a few hours..\"That was me. What I got was a riveting series. One that pulled my in by the neck, and never let up. This series is a master class in suspense and character.It\\'s so good! Thanks to everyone who made this, honestly!,First, its boring. How come a zombie movie boring? Thats surprised me as well.The writing is so bad. Is the story writer newbie?The story went slowly, they try to put emotional scenes, but the scenes were not touching at all. Theres a lot of crying but im not even feel sad. And im actually easily moved.I try so hard not to skip and fast forwards those episodes.What with the teen love story? They have no chemistry, so intead of moved by their hearts, its just like some baseless stupid move.The students were not so bright, 6 episodes and none of them try to hold something for a weapon with them all the time, not even broom or a stick. I get it if they are stupid, but having a survival instinct would be rational.Im questioning all of their decisions. Lol. These kids have no hope.And finally, none of the cast that makes you feel like \"i hope they survive\", if at the end all of them is dead, its not even surprising, and even satisfying. Seeing how thise kids act in the middle of crisis.The only good stuff is the bloody scenes, those are executed well. But still, you need to skip like half of the time to see bloody scenes.,I like the show but I don\\'t like the show. I want to feel like this could actually happen. Zombies infestation and now you have to survive. So why are we talking about our feelings and who likes who? We should be making plans and executing plans not stopping to talk about how this makes us feel. It takes the realism out of it. This could be a great show if the writers said what would I do in this situation instead of how can we throw in as many metaphors and quotes that now for some reason we have to analyze. Also, weren\\'t those soldiers trained? How did they miss shooting him so badly that he was only hit randomly underwater? They should\\'ve lit him up profusely before he even touched the water. The jokes are cool and even the playfulness is okay but when things get so far fetched that it alters what the characters do it makes the scene nonsensical. I\\'m in the middle of the 7th episode right now. Hope nothing truly dumb comes up to alter the me watching a second season.,That girl in the white hoodie took my nerves.So annoying af ngl I nearly quit that show so annoying this girl was. Who cast her ? Real question WHO ? Was that guy on some pills or something ?,Honestly, the trailer looked awesome but the show itself is absolutely disappointing! It\\'s so slow, so much talking and too many plotlines that are not needed.The gore was okay but could\\'ve been better. So many characters did not make sense, within a matter of minutes the virus has made half human and half zombie without there being a follow up on that.Characters that should\\'ve had a big impact on the story end up being pointless. There is more time spent talking and sitting around a fire than there is zombies. They spend so much of the time running from room to room which could easily been avoided if they just secured the room.The fact that too many characters are annoying and just do nothing for the story.This show is bad. Really bad. I do not recommend.,Honestly looks like they had everything (budget) to make this a great tv show\\r\\nunfortunately is horrible and poorly written.The characters omg , where should l start?Are we suppose to do think that teens in schools are so dumb?Zero skills to survive or think head ?One of the main character the fight fighter daughter , shockingly slow and dumb or maybe she has some mental issues?But overall all the characters super sad, pathetic, useless.Why did the writers write such a thing?Not even one of them was switch on.Also some flashbacks about happy memories super super cheesymaybe if you are a boy/girl under 10years old you might love it but if you have some decent intelligence you might feel this is extremely sad and dumb.Example they see someone no zombie yet and they wait until he/she become a zombie and then they start screaming :P instead of killing it before\\r\\n. That happened many many times.And many others situation are actually hard to watch.The Adults acting is actually very bad too.Like l said before its a shame because they had all to make this great.And instead they made everyone useless and no charismatic at all.I couldn\\'t have any sympathy with any of them at all.Please try to make it a little realistic at least a little this was sad.,I just finished season 1 and I get the first 3-4 episode were meh... the kids made a lot of trash decisions. I do like a lot of apocalyptic movies/series, So its a 9/10 I know its to high but... well see how it goes with Season 2.,Some very cringey moments, idiotic decisions made by characters and it drags too but once you get used to it you can get hooked.Not the best Zombie show out there but it\\'s quite entertaining. Hope they make Season 2.,Simply put, this series had a great opening but jumped the shark as quickly as it began. The characters are what reduced my score from potential 8 stars. They simply became too annoying from half-way and on. I got so infuriated with the teenagers whining and arguing to no end. The whole season was like watching a cat fight. I can see one or two brash characters, but almost all of them either physically or mentally abuse one other. Is that Korean culture for kids to act that way? There are barely any redeemable quality any of the teens possessed. And some plots dragged for far too long like Gwami and the suicidal girl (forgot her name). She is the perfect character to be redeemed; to do something that mattered to the plot in a positive way. Sadly they made her an even more of a depressing villain. It\\'s sad to say, but I kind of wished all of the kids turned at the end. They were that badly written.,They overrated the drama the series was just crying and surviving i guess this is korean drama it\\'s not interesting or the story so ridiculous kids can make better zombie series better than this.,The zombies are good. But honestly all of those kids should be dead within the first 5 minutes from their decision making. Everything else seemed unrealistic.,Mostly dragging on to much, with wooden acting and just laughable dialogue. Its pretty boring most of the time, with hilarious scenes in which main characters dodge dozens of zombies in narrow corridors becaus plot armor. Emotional impact missing, some deaths just random and some ... lets say weird superpowers. If one had started to fly at the end, I would not hav been surprised.Made it to episode 6 before checking out.It is well crafted in some regards, hence a 6 out of 10. But you won\\'t miss out much if you don\\'t watch it.,What a rollercoaster! If you like any suspenseful (zombie) movies/series (Train to Busan, Kingdom, Sweet Home) with a touch of romance. This is a must watch!Cheong-San & Nim-ra are the ones stealing the show. Cheong-San devotion to his friends & family made his character really likable. You really feel for him. My favorite scene was the library scene of Cheong-San. He really has the toughest action scenes of the whole cast. I hope he is one of the halbies in an upcoming season. For Nim-ra she slowly grown into me from a not so interesting character to one of the main focus of the story.Mostly I have difficulties with the Korean names. I tend to mix them up, but luckily the names here chosen are easier to recognize and to remember.Only thing I missed and I really was anticipating for was a show down between the bullied girl Eung-ji and the bully Gwi-nam. This was a miss since Eung-ji has now all the strength to fight back.Looking forward to season 2!,Very good series, covering the bullying problem in schools well.Not too reliant on CGI and no sugar coated happy ending that you get with American programmes/films.,I saw the trailer and was like \"It\\'ll be ok\" cos I like the zombie genre and I think Train To Busan is the greatest zombie movie of all time. So I was looking forward to this show but with a very average expectation. So I watched the firsts episode and instantly got hooked. The introduced the characters well, friction between all of them was further developed even better as the show progresses. It is fun, thrilling and an entertaining show that had me binging deep into the night. 12 episode and I thought none felts boring. It is a very good show and worth it very much.,What a thrilling ride!! Literally keeps you on edge of your seat!!! Don\\'t go with nagative reviews. I don\\'t know what they expect from zombie movies/series!Really liked character development throughout the episodes. Plot is amazing! Enjoyed those comic parts, and thank god they mept these comic scenes becase at some points everything gets so intense that my breathing just stopped, but thanks to those funny scenes that gave some relaxation!,Exceptional! If you loved Train to Busan, you\\'re going to like this one too. It might not be moving as fast as the movie since it\\'s a series after all. But acting, storytelling etc. Have been executed well. And you cannot really predict what\\'s going to happen in the next episode!,I thought the zombie acting was very realistic, from the growling, to the walking on the floor like the exorcist, and their joints cracking. I loved that most of the kids that survived had a connection with a least another student aside from On-jos dad that ended up dying, that\\'s what made it so emotional. That\\'s the part of the story line that kept me watching. The only thing I disliked and I thought was like kind of dumb about this story, is the fact that this science teacher started a whole ass pandemic due to his son getting bullied ? I don\\'t condemn that kind of behavior from anyone of course. And he needed to do something about it. However, creating a virus because of it, it\\'s the dumbest most selfish thing I\\'ve ever heard.,This Korean fun and thriller show is a really great example of how students think when they are in school when they \"daydream\". The show has few really great twist and turns that makes the show more fun and lovable to watch. One season is only there but from the start till the end the show will not let you leave your seats. Yes there are a few loopholes but every movie or series have them but the good thing is that more good things are there to talk about. In short a really good and fun show to watch if one loves zombies.,This show is like The Walking Dead, but instead of 70% of the cast being totally uninteresting, useless, and annoying, 100% manages to live up to that lame standard. It reminds me of the rubbish programming that Netflix used to provide about five years ago. Back when people were canceling their memberships in mass.,Okay so the good - it\\'s fun, the pacing works well and keeps you interested. The characters are played by young actors to reflect their high-school personas. Overall the concept is great and it starts off very promising. There\\'s also some original strategies to escaping the zombies which is nice to see.Now for the bad - the writing has no direction. Characters are built up over episodes only to be wasted away in minutes. The build up to pay off ratio, in terms of plot and character development for each character, feels completely unbalanced and poorly considered.This wasteful storytelling becomes frustrating at the midway point where it\\'s easy to stop caring about anything or anyone since it seems like the writers also don\\'t seem to care.,First, I highly recommend watching with original audio and subtitles. The dub version voice acting is just not engaging enough.This classic zombie plot series stands out by deeply portraying a variety of characters who don\\'t typically frustrate the viewer by making poor decisions. You begin to connect with the characters and empathize with their decisions. Don\\'t get too cozy with them as the series takes a GOT \"no character is safe\" approach.From start to finish each zombie encounter felt real. Nothing seemed too absurd including the various emotional impacts of certain decisions.Excellent series with minimal areas for improvement!,An absolute gem, great story, great acting and fantastic make up and effects. Flew through the season and left me hoping for season 2. I can\\'t recommend enough. Teen woes, deadly zombie virus, desperate rescues and sacrifices. No one is safe.,If you liked Kingdom, this will be right up your street.The plot revolves around a zombie outbreak in a small town in South Korea and centres prominently on the students of the local high school. The twist here is that some infected remain more or less human and are a danger to the survivors with one in particular slowly hunting them down. There are back stories for most students and their cooperation is tantamount to their survival.The zombie chase scenes are fast paced and mostly believable. There are also poignant moments to change the pace along with some slower tense horror elements. The show also touches on guilt of those involved in dealing with the larger zombie problem.It\\'s a well made, acted and scripted show that contains scenes that stand up against some big budget movies. Here\\'s hoping for a second season.,This show is amazing. They bring a fresh take on the zombie genre with notes on innocent love, true friendships, and hardships that are honestly heartbreaking at times. It\\'s well rounded and disappointing at times but it\\'s so incredibly worth watching. I rated the show a 9/10 because I am so disappointed at who loses their lives. There\\'s so many characters you fall in love with only to lose them. There could have been at least one off limits!,At a time where the zombie apocalypse scenarios seems already saturated and overdone, there comes a show that breathes some new life (ironic, I know) into the genre.All of Us Are Dead is an extremely well-made show that nails pretty much everything it sets out to do. The action is almost constante and relentless, but they still find time to work some effective and really well written drama, excellent characters and even some goofy comedy scenes.There\\'s a lot to love here, but I think what really makes this show works is the characters. In a similar vein to Stranger Things\\' first season, they managed to create some really compelling and emotionally engaged cast of characters. The teenagers are not unsufferable assholes like in most shows, instead they feel like real people, with real issues and strenghts, and you really want to see them succeed and escape.It\\'s one of those shows merely talking about it doesn\\'t really does it justice. It can even sound kind of dumb in paper, but once you see it action on the screen, you get mesmerized. The people behind this show really pulled off some bold and creative ideas that many other would\\'ve easily screw up.Especial credits must be given to the young cast of actors, who not only have stellar dramatic performance, but also some incredibly physical stunt work and zombie sequences.The only downsides I can think of are some (very) minor plot holes and the fact that the show does get a little tiny bit repectitive. Other than that, this is a must watch, especially for genre fans.,Was this supposed to be the Korean version of Stranger Things? I love Asian cinema but this is so childish And badly acted that I quit after one episode. Move along. Nothing to see here.,I have just done binge-watching the whole drama within a night and have enjoyed it! Well, the plot has some weak points that will be easy to finger-pointing while watching. However, it makes more sense than other monstrous apocalyptic k-dramas on Netflix that I have seen (e.g. Better than Sweet Home in many aspects I\\'d say).It has pointed out the problem with our justice system and humanity. Also, that, at dangerous moments, it\\'s love and hope that binds us together.Jumping to the ending scene, it\\'s nice that it has ended with giving hope that not everyone that we saw dead is actually dead. I bet that if there\\'s a second season, it\\'ll show Cheong-san surviving the bombing (by becoming a mutated zombie like Gwi-Nam with self-regenerating power).,I don\\'t know how the people are watching this stupitidy who gave more than 3 stars ??? With their eyes or their asses I dont know really. What I know is, considering the stupitidies done in this serie, people would do the same idiotic things in real life too in same situations. So that means, people who gave more than 3 stars are in the same idiotic mind with the people in the serie.,At first it seemed mostly korean soap drama but as it progresses the story gets better and better. It was enjoyable and I liked the way people would react (from ordinary people to military and even political people).,One of the best zombie series from Korea after kingdom...!!!! A must see ..!!!Awesome action sequences, suspense , gore , the scenes cherographed was too good , and the story was great...!!!,All of us Are Dead: This is a zombie Survival thriller web series. How this virus spreads from one school to the whole city and everyone is trying to save their lives, is shown in the series. The series gets interesting from the first episode itself. Direction is good but editing could have been better. Every episode is for one hour, so it gets boring at times. The work by all the actors was fantastic and the zombies looked great too. Although the concept was not new, it was heartening to see the way it was presented to us. You can definitely watch it once.,Really decent at first when I saw it on the netflix programmes you might like i though it looks two bob but put it on for background and couldn\\'t take my eyes off it the further in you watch the better it gets. Pure action no pc cr*b just non stop. Wish the west made zombies like this.,This show had some things going for it. The government that is actually competent, the original (as far as I know) idea of halfbies and the fact that\\'s it not in the US made me hope for a unique take on a zombie show.However, this show falls into the same mistakes as so many of its competitors: illogical decisions and behaviour by the survivors. It tires me to think how many times this show did the thing where everybody stand around the person who is, as everyone is very aware of, about to turn into a zombie, but instead of taking advantage of the zombies weakness before it fully turns, they stare at it with mouths wide open. This stands among many plot holes and issues I had with the show, from very general things like the dumb self-sacrifices to specific things like the forest hiking sequence in the last episode where On-Jo follows the golden ribbons. I don\\'t think I have to explain why that scene was ridiculous.Going into this show, I was excited for a good take on a zombie show and was, in most aspects, disappointed.,It\\'s fun! The main characters were escaping throughout the series only to be trapped. At last they finally escape with losing some of their friends. A freaking YouTuber makes us laugh! Jae-ik and the man are a good comedic duo. Gwi-nam is a freaking character and also he keeps the series interesting. It will be great. Cheong-San\\'s death brings up tears. Overall the best zombie series.,I went into this series completely blind, somehow even missed the zombies on the cover. I\\'m generally not a fan of media that have to do with zombies but this is one I actualy enjoyed quite a bit.The action scenes worked really really well and must have been quite hard to film with all the chaos happening in each scene and how many zombies were there attacking and running. I found all those scenes very impressive and genuinely had me at the edge of my seat.The soundtrack of the series isn\\'t all that much but in a show like this where you constantly run around that doesn\\'t really mean it\\'s that big of a deal. The actors did a really good job as well, no complaints in that aspect.Now when it comes to the writting of this series, you can more or less understand (mostly) where the show is going. They need to find a cure for the virus and as always there are people that are somehow kind of immune to it which did disappointed me as it is a plot tool used in every zombie-themed movie.The main \"villain\", Gwi Nam was indeed threatening but seeing him rise so many times after getting hit and thrown off the building I laughed and found it silly almost. Also, I am certain that when he first killed a zombie (stabbing it on the throat) some blood got in his mouth so given the events that continued he should have turned into a zombie at that point already. Another thing I\\'d like to point out that didn\\'t make sense to me was what they did with Na-yeon. I expected she\\'d turn into half a zombie as Gwi Nam bit her but that didn\\'t happen and even though I hated her as a character I did want to see something more be done with her character.Last I want to point out my biggest problem with the series. It took me too many episodes to start caring about the characters. I didn\\'t want them to get killed but I didn\\'t care enough either. Half the reason is probably because teenagers act as teenagers but the romance parts felt very unnecessary at times and really made the show slow down and made the situation with the zombie apocalypse seem less important to the characters which I found ridiculous.Were there too many deaths? Yes. Were they unnecessary? Some of them. For example Onjo\\'s father which ended up being my favorite character. I found him the most grounded character in the whole show and was really disappointed to see him die the way he did after all that development. Development is essential for me to make a death actually impactful but with him I felt like he was killed off just to keep our main characters the kids.,Where do i start... this is about teenagers and puppy love kinda story. The plot is lame and the script is the worst. This is a Zombie series for preteens or younger. Not good... stay away.My 2 stars arr for good zombie effects and cgi.,AOUAD is great zombie survival show though it borrows many elements from other manga\\'s (like sweet home) and train to busan but it is really original. Forget high school of the dead thats pure echhi. But this is really thrilling survival horror show. Cinematography and direction is good. Zombies are scaries. Show isn\\'t predictable and ending is not that good. Cliffhangers are bad but action makes it all for it. If you liked this i recommend read SWEET HOME webtoon. A must watch for people coming in zombie genre.,Very thrilling and emotional for me. If you lose everyone you love very truly, and still you are not able to do anything, this hurts very much. I think this webseries is for strong hearted people where lot of violence is present.,This show has all the check-marks you\\'d expect from a fairly high budget show.And yet, it all falls completely flat as it tries to present a gruesome horror setting, combined with corny and comedic anime-like characters and situation handling.It\\'s watchable from start to finish ... but you really need to turn your brain off ... almost to the point like a zombie at at least half of it ...Some episodes are bloated by either dragged out scenes or by repetition. Watching someone turn for the 6th time, in the same dramatic way, without previously building an emotional connection to those characters is played out by the 3rd episode.Most of the situations are handled borderline moronic, and the consistency of the plot is reminiscent of a wet fart.The worst of it was suffered by the dialog. It was either written by a computer, or a person who\\'d previously had very little social interaction with others.If I\\'d have to come up with key-words that best describe the show, they would be: inconsistent, borderline comedic, dragged out and non-sensical.I still can\\'t decide if this was intended to be a comedy or a satire of the zombie genre, because it definitely can\\'t be taken serious as horror/drama. And the show is self aware of what it\\'s trying to do, as its characters reference the far better executed Train to Busan in more then once.I\\'m aware that it\\'s a zombie movie, so it\\'s a \"turn your brain off\" kind of viewing, but this show puts absolutely no effort into trying to take itself serious even within it\\'s own imaginary world.This would have worked 100% better as an animated feature considering the cartoonish characters situation handling and presentation.,The first 3 episodes are really promising that I can\\'t wait for more. Then the series goes downhill to the last episode. It became so cliche and lame. For instances; Nam Ra could have just screams run to them once she smelled zombies instead of detecting how many zombies were coming. Also, instead of running on the road, why wouldn\\'t they just hide in an empty house? Moreover, they decided to fight the zombies with sticks and hammer? Okay Thor. And the mom is the dumbest by entering a field full with infected and called the obviously infected and get eaten. She deserved it. The father of the female lead went through a lot to find her daughter just to have a less than a minute scene with her. Also, there are too many self reflecting scenes among them. Honestly, we don\\'t care. Last but not least, the director could\\'ve just utilized the halfbies (The bully and Nam Ra) characters more. It\\'d be a great ending if they both fighting for their own interest either for good and bad. Or maybe they could control all the zombies and use their ability to end the pandemic. The directors probably save the characters for the next series I hoped.,I only watched 2 episode right now ...guys its awsome its not serious like TWD.but its not funny as ZOMBOAT...trust me you will like it even you are not ZOMBIE fan .....,I don\\'t know, I simply enjoyed it. I liked the teenage drama feel combined with gore and survival. Although I feel like there were too many unnecessary deaths, everyone was always sacraficing themselves, it was starting to get annoying.I hope we get a season 2 and a proper storyline for the \"half zombies\"ps Cheong-san deserved better!,Shame cause first episode was amazing zombies runing around people runing away really good action.But then second episode kids drama and plot armor to main kids.They start kicking zombies ash and.one kid is Jett Lee.3 episode is the same way i just got tierd of it.Shame cause first episode was amazing!,So far it\\'s been a generic plot. Nothing happening other than people turning into zombies.5/10 coz I haven\\'t watched it in entirety.Waste of time tbh.,It was a good series\\r\\nWatched it after #alive\\r\\nIdk why lol but all korean movies seem to be about zombies but they cool i like them\\r\\nTalking about this series was worth watching every second and minute of the movie was worth it.Loved it.,Seeing this on Netflix trending list I expected something watchable, not some dumb zombie series in which every character behaves like a zombie even before they become one.,The first couple of episodes was a bust, i was on the verge of quitting it but I decided to continue and I am glad I did. The reason as a lot of people said before me was the emotions in the first couple of episodes lacked, however further on their emotions do come out. Had some funny parts as well as sad parts. I enjoyed it so watch all the episodes before you rate it because it does get better.,I did noy expect this movie to be very good but it did surprise me in many ways. Definitely its the best zombie movie right now.It has pretty much everything - good evolving story, zombies, kids, love stories and politicians, nice cliff hangers in each episode etc.,Just when I thought I\\'d lost my appetite for Zombies, this gem of a series turns up on Netflix. For me it ticks all the boxes, I like the story behind how the virus was created. As you should, I liked and disliked the main characters in equal measure. There were enough perilous situations to keep me entertained and characters were killed off on a regular basis. As always with the Korean shows, they managed to bring some originality to proceedings. So it\\'s a solid 8 from me.,This series is like a heaven for zombie lovers. 12 hours of constant fast paced zombies. Story is good, acting is good. The way they created the scene and casted actors, everything is amazing. I watch even stupid zombie movies, but this one was done really really well. Go for it. After Kingdom, train to busan this is one of best next gem from Korean cinemas. Congrats to all the team !!,Watched the whole thing despite it being very bad. Had a couple of redeeming aspects like the halfbie concept but overall just lame. It really drags everything out for so long. The constant falling over gets really annoying. Go watch Black Summer if you want zombies. Go watch 8th grade or Booksmart if you want modern teen drama.,I started watching this with no great expectations .. I just like a good zombie series and needed something that would be easy to watch ..and yet I found myself really taking a shine to the characters..it really is all you could possibly hope for in a zombie program...exciting, plenty of deaths, plenty of bad decisions for sure ..but nothing too unrealistic in my opinion.....thoroughly enjoyed this, and found it quite original in tone.. in a genre that\\'s been seriously abused by the Walking Dead franchise among others......,I was so excited to see this. First three episodes were good but then sloppy writing took place. There is so much that happens that makes ZERO sense. How can people go days and days without water or food? Why wouldn\\'t you hide in a house or store when you know zombies are headed for you; instead, you stand outside? You see someone you care for get bitten and is turning, but you cry and tell others not to kill them?Definitely, the writers need to be replaced for season two and stop writing material that makes no sense. Have some sense of reality and what could happen. The over dramatic teen angst and was too much. By then end, I wanted all of the characters to die because I was so frustrated with the shows.,This series is one of the best zombie survival. It resembles train to busan. But it eas great to show the series interesting throughout 12 hours. Not boring at any place. Many seat cornering scenes are there . One of the best thriller k drama after squid game. Worth for 12 hours.,Some of the characters were a little annoying and the romantic interests felt just a bit silly and somewhat ill fitting given it\\'s an apocalyptic scenario. I felt it was aimed at a predominantly teen audience and that it was really quite laboured with not a great deal happening given that it was over 11 hours of TV. It could easily have been done in 8 episodes. Those criticisms aside it was otherwise reasonably entertaining.,Stopped watching partway through the second episode.Couldn\\'t stand the truly terrible \"physics\" in the CGI sequences. Makes typical ragdoll physics in a game look fantastic in comparison.Characters are stupid, not just because they lack any depth or realistic motivation, they are stupid.So many sequences where dozens of bystanders don\\'t react at all to a dramatic event that would in reality draw the attention of anyone nearby.Scenes don\\'t make any sense and are clumsily thrown in in a misguided attempt to add meaning or depth. (sudden and convenient influx in people/zombies jumping out windows for example)Another overrated pile of garbage.,I usually love these these types of shows but this was absolutely painful to sit through. How do you make a show where every single character is unlikable? Seriously, the students are all rapists, thugs, bullies. The teachers are monsters. The police are monsters. I don\\'t think the writers of this show understand that you actually need someone to cheer for otherwise its just pointless violence. For comparison, Happiness (2021) is a million times better zombie show than this garbage.,This series has been pulled unnecessarily into 12 long bad episodes. Extremely slow, and cliche acting and storyline. Some of the actors are so bad, they literally have zero reaction even after seeing a zombie...lol. Does not live up to the over hyped trailers...sigh.,This show is pretty awesome and well done.If you dont like teenagers in school this isnt for you.If you love everything zombies then you\\'ll enjoy the heck out of this.It has lots of great zombie attacks and isnt dull.I hope there is as many seasons as the walking dead or at least a few more.,Wow is it really stressful to watch #AllOfUsAreDead ? I really want to tune in but seeing all of the reaction makes me think twice lol. What else is there to say about this series once for sure, even those who like zombies must see it.,Some reviews \"big this up\" and others don\\'t, I\\'m in the don\\'t camp. Watched E 1&2 then jumped to E 12 to see the ending (nothing special).Seems Korean students ages range from mid-twenties to late thirties. The one upside is not watching the woke inclusive snooze-fest that would be forced upon oneself if filmed in a western country.,What was that?? I\\'m completely amazed, bruh.Ignore the bad reviews already. Just watch it for ur own fun.It\\'s Gory, and I loved it. Watched the first 5 episode. And it\\'s a good run.This is a good series in the zombie franchise.Must watch.Gumawo.,Very good show, i love the mix between high school drama and zombies, the producers focused on group of people and made you interact with their problems to evoke your empathy when they die you feel sad, and it worked smoothly as indented, that technique in storytelling always makes me question my morals do i only care about the group of people they present maybe thousands died but i only got affected when the main character died: i love stories about a war between love and fear which makes the moments with the loved one more valuable, i really dig that kind of romance; overall the show is a success.,Storywise, I like this series better than \"Happiness\" because the happy ending is not too forced.However, in terms of the actors, especially the ML and FL, Happiness won. Both ML and the FL are so good looking and attractive in Happiness while on this \"All of us are dead\" are not as attractive as the other series.Nevertheless, Hyeong syuk - Nam Ra are definitely my favorite characters here.The zombies were also more realistic here than Happiness.Another part that I feel very realistic was when they needed to go to the toilet. The fact that you\\'re fighting the living dead doesn\\'t make you immune to pooping and peeing!!I hope there would be 2nd season bc I\\'m curious about Nam Ra story.,Some SpoilersThe series is overall very entertaining and tense but the script writers went the cheap way like many zombie related films. The first few episodes are fantastic and, i genuinely say this, a must watch for any fan of this genre.The rest, however, is not as perfect. The show is still entertaining and worth it, yes, but it suffers from the excessive plot armor syndrome present in many zombie-related works.The show tries to alleviate this feeling of \"cheapness\" by killing off some developed characters but it\\'s still irritating to see the same character keep coming back and back just because the plot of the high-school group would be a bit too predictable without them. What this leads to is a predictable sequence of events, but unpredictable character deaths (except for 2).The acting is as believable as it is enjoyable and there\\'s only a little amount of wooden characters (which is a really good aspect of in show.)It\\'s pretty safe to say that the target audience is a group of high schoolers because the constant emotional drama (that seem to be not very important and just there) between the characters might bore the average viewer.This is a modern and entertaining addition to the genre and worth binging for those itching for more zombie action. I was going to give it a 7/10, but the intro riff is so good, I bumped it up to a righteous 8/10.,Honestly speaking , I thought this would be just a random zombie series that others usually do . But this one hits different . There are a few lags in between , yes but none of them matter coz that\\'s what adds up to show . The start maybe a bit slow where the students hide in different rooms but after the 4th episode, I binged till the end. That\\'s how the show keeps you hooked up . Kudos to everyone involved and thankyou for such an amazing experience.,A series which is scary , emotional , and love story .A perfect combination!You will definitely connect with the characters .Good cinematography .Best camera anglesBest visual effectsBest camera qualityStoryline is bestEverything is goodYou should watch this series .,If you want to have a good laugh with friends, you\\'ve come to the right place. I\\'ve reached the conclusion that this series was actually produced, funded, filmed,\\r\\ndirected and acted by the high school teenagers themselves. What a scream...,One of the greatest zombie story ever told on screen, the atmosphere and characters make this TV show so relatable and remarkable. If you love zombie apocalypse genre that will be your cup of tea, can\\'t wait for season 2!,Its about choices, ethical dilemmas, power, helplessness, politics, bullying, principles and about what makes life worth living.I found the series to be ok, some of the very typical Korean fat shaming, dumb shaming and self worth through societal achievements, but I guess it comes with the territory.I find it quite weird that there isn\\'t a whole legion of people complaining and calling it woke. Guess they hid it well enough with splatter and gore.Then again most Zombie movies are about us and choices.,I don\\'t get all the negative reviews. Entertaining zombie film with a touch of Korean comedy and Korean drama. Great acting from everyone. Don\\'t read other reviews, watch and decide for yourself.,I love this show. The story and the character actions and development are well written and logical. Nothing happens because plot needs it to happen. It\\'s well tied up and smart. People don\\'t make stupid decisssion like we are used to seeing in this type of shows. Their motives are linked to their characters and relationships. Also it does portray how I imagine a real apocalypse would look like where people die on regular basis regardless how much we root for them not to. However the last couple of episodes appear to be quite repetitive with similar set pieces and situations. Also the main villain and his interaction with the surviving students is just a tiny bit annoying for the reasons you will have to see for yourself. I will finish with the positive note as the show also avoids the preachy trap of western shows and focused on the story rather then social messages and mandatory tick-boxing. Overall a great show. After the squid game this is absolutely a must-see runner up.,What happens if you mix five doses of bullying, a handful of obnoxious school kids, one bad script+directing combo, bake it only halfway, and sprinkle some very light horror on top of it? You get a poorly made south-korean \"pop hit\" with overinflated reviews. I realize that south-korean drama has a different formula, a different flair to it, when compared to other countries\\' , but this just feels like Korean Bollywood. Sometimes, it feels like a Japanese advert director was giving \"pro tips\" off-camera.,Just your typical zombie movies like the ones in West, too much drama stupidity and no logic. They even say have you watch the movie Train to Busan? And still not learn anything from it, the police and soldiers aren\\'t even using guns in the beginning episodes.,This was amazing! I actually enjoyed this series more than Squid Game! Everything was perfectly timed. A lot of the characters had development and grew throughout the series. Wonderful! Can\\'t wait for season 2!,I found this to be boring nonsense. The zombie scenes are well done hence a rating of 2 and not 1.It is a bunch of immature stupid children stuck in a school during a zombie apocolypse and all they do is cry and argue and keep saying \"it\\'s all my fault\" except for one who keeps saying \"it\\'s all your fault\".,Well yes there are some plot hole in this series but yeah idk I didn\\'t care at all LOL\\r\\nThe tension and thrilling moments are so good and fun, I just enjoy when watch this series.Namra is the coolest and my favorite character in here. I keep watching this because of her. She\\'s so brave and calm and wow...just cool. The love story between Namra and Suhyeok is my favorite scene. I NEED THE SEASON 2 ASAP!,Acting was sub par even for a teenage Korean series. The female lead has exactly one expression. All characters behave in the most irrational ways possible. The whole refugee camp arc has nothing to do with anything at all. The pace of the series was so slow and nonsensical that you can skip most of the boring, script-reading scenes.,It\\'s not even good, yet people rate higher than 1 star. Slow pacing, lots if unecessary dialogue, conflicts were forced, and mutations were so random. I love zombie movies, but this is just meh. Wasted my time. Skipped through every single episode just to get to the \"good\" parts.,This show is so different from every other zombies movie or series, It\\'s very interesting how the virus works which we find out later, the virus was supposed to help the weak, it\\'s not just that but I won\\'t say too much but it\\'s so interesting and it\\'s not some stupid action movie, and it breaks a lot of stereotypes of tv series, and the best thing is the characters know how zombies work, it\\'s so meta. It\\'s rlly good.,So, original ideas have apparently vanished. This show is pretty much a live action Korean version of the anime: high school of the dead. It\\'s just, Meh! Has none of the originality and entertainment value of the original. Very disappointed.,Typical Zombie episodic show. They could have done this very well with a 2 hour movie skipping a lot of the unnecessary character subplots which were way too long. They even reference a Zombie flick Train to Busan. Acting for the most part was very good as well as the location shooting.,She is half zombie she isn\\'t affected by zombies. She never went to grab them supplies or food or water, she never goes ahead and clean the path from zombies. She is always running with them like she has anything to be afraid off\\r\\nAlso , why the zombies head never pop all of them are like superman they keep beefing them but nothing happens.,The series hooks a lot, in realism with which everything happens from the emotional reactions,\\r\\ngovernment strategies and reaction is very well written.It is one of the few zombie series or movies that I have seen where the protagonists do not start doing illogical nonsense.On the other hand, the level of acting is very good and the staging of some scenes is at another level.,I love everything zombie. Everything. But the majority of characters in this are so damn stupid, unlikeable, selfish or just plain evil. I spent the whole series wishing they\\'d get eaten or turned because of how terrible most of the characters are. There was a couple of good ones. But the students you\\'re meant to root for are just kind of awful and annoying.Great effects and some great acting, but the characters are so... blah. I suppose that\\'s the point though. Humans don\\'t really deserve to survive since they suck so much. True in a way.,The show starts, in netflix-esque fashion, with a event that would never happen like that in a natural situation. This show boils down to overdrawn characters and teenagers being teenagers. Don\\'t waste your time on this fine looking but poor written piece.,I like that type of movies, but I couldnt stand this one, was watching with my wife, but we stopped at 2 episode, as it was simply boring.You can give it a try if you are desperate to watch anything.,I really don\\'t understand how anyone can rate this above a 5. It\\'s awful: unrealistic script, bad acting, amateur directing. The zombies are pathetic with their contortions and clicking sound effects. Another reviewer said it should be called We are all stupid. Most poignant comment ever on this embarrassing series. The rotten tomatoes rating doesn\\'t reflect the critics reviews. Don\\'t waste your time.,Well made series....it is best zombies film/webseries till date...full of emotion ride and characters love...all characters are extraordinary...I mention one actor (who played Chong San) his acting was brillent . I am fan this chracter...but all cast are preety good....story are so fabulous ( zombies in school) 👍👍,I know these people were just thrown into a zombie apocalypse but there are just decisions some of these characters make that just require common sense.Example: if you see the privileged loner girl wiping blood off a mop handle, SAY SOMETHING before she uses it to infect one of her own.Also who cares about honorifics and courtesy during an attack on your schoolAnd then there is Cheong-su\\'s mom, who braves Hyosan to try to get to her child and get through many infected except she doesn\\'t realize one of his friends is infected and stupidly calls out to him.,I\\'m amazed how many of you are saying that is a great zombie idea.I\\'ll tell you is NOT.First episode started well and then when infection strikes all of the students started to play too dumb, their reaction is not realistic at all, when you see zombies coming to you, you simply run like hell not playing around the zombie crowdAfter 5 minutes of second episode I said NO. It\\' not worth my time.,Talking about the positives the series has good characters, story, suspence and a new type of zombies that can be called as half zombies. The show is suspenseful from beginning to the end and won\\'t really bore you cause there are many interesting events that happen in each episode that makes you wanna watch the next episode. However the show is quite repetitive in terms of the zombie encounters and the way they deal with the zombies sometimes is both senseless and impractical. Also the show uses quite a few \"fake\" Encounters and incidents to lure the audience to the next episode. The climax of the show is good but it leaves a lot of questions that needs to be answered but at the same time it seems unnecessary to make another season just to answer those questions cause those questions aren\\'t that interesting to make people wanna watch another season. Overall it\\'s a good way to pass your free time.,I really liked the first few episodes of this show, and throughout it I continued to think the setting was great and the performances ranged from good to great. The writing, though, is just the laziest, hackiest garbage imaginable. It basically requires every single character to do the dumbest possible thing at any given time, with little to any justification, just so the showrunners can get to another set piece or action scene. That\\'s lazy writing and the rest of the show (and the audience) deserves better.,And... I have seen a lot. The thrill and action with which this series kept me latched to episode after episode - I loved it.The cast did great acting, became a fan of a few actors. Screenplay was amazing, editing was crisp, the zombies were believable (quintessential zombies) and it is worth a second season. I hope to see the characters again.Great job team \"all of us are dead\",Don\\'t give up after 2-3 episodes.I\\'m not a huge fan of the genre, and I skimmed through a lot of chase scenes because they get to be a bit repetitive.However, I found myself enjoying this show more and more. While there are familiar tropes from past zombie show playbooks, there are plenty of new things in the show that have kept me engaged throughout.,Now I loved TWD in the early seasons but after the departure of glen then Carl and the final straw Rick it became boring and soap opera so after seeing the trailer for all of us are dead I was intrigued into wether this could fill my zombie void and I\\'m glad to say it did,this series had some great new takes on the zombie virus and executed them well the story can become slow paced at times but the effects stunts and action is a joy to watch,12 1 hour episodes is a long stretch but I enjoyed most of it and shall look forward to season 2.,Unfortunately for me, I watched this show until the end and I can confidently say that it has almost no redeeming quality. Seriously, whoever is in charge with the plot and characters is either really bad in their job or want to troll the audiences.The plot is really bad. They created some interesting characters and then gave them no character development or gave them a lot of backstories and then killed them off before they can do anything. (To Cheong San\\'s mom : are you really going to approach your son\\'s classmate casually even when he 100% look like a zombie? Like for real?)That being said, the characters are idiots. We see various characters fight off zombies in 12 episodes and more often than not they tried to do it with bare hands like in a school gang fight. Makeshift weapons and things that are essential for survival like food and water? Oh no, they don\\'t have time for that. Love confessions, love rectangles, and holding hands singing kumbaya are more important. They need a pc to search for information about outside world? Chuck it to the zombies even when the room is full with other things. Someone pissed you off because your other friends like them more than you? Kill him, who need more believable reason?Yes, this show pissed me off. The 3 stars is for the archer girl, Ha Ri, who\\'s still an idiot but a cool idiot.,I enjoyed the story and the acting, but the casting for the English dubbing was awful and really distracted me from what my eyes were seeing.Every voice sounded like a well-spoken 20-somethings. No matter who the on-screen character was, they all sounded the same - young or old, good upbringing or not. The kids didn\\'t sound like schools kids, they all sounded like posh 20-something Yale or Harvard students.,This show is about as bad and nonsensical as \"Train to Busan\". It\\'s another storyline for people who don\\'t mind having every element spoonfed to them through tropes and stereotypes. It offers no new takes on zombies, Korea\\'s bullying culture, cheesey romantic crushes, or the ability of those in charge to take action rather than cover up an issue. If you\\'re looking for a quality zombie story, this will be 14 hours of your life misspent. It\\'s almost as bad as \"Z Nation\" but without the failed attempts at humor.,Was gonna give this a 9 but when the dad sacrificed himself for his daughter at the tennis court, I had had enough of the terrible writing of this show. There was no reason for that.,Central to the plot is a horrific theme of constant and brutal bullying, which is not only disturbing, miserable and frustrating to watch, but is the least creative subplot conceivable for a high school drama. I can\\'t imagine how anyone could muscle through a viewing of the whole season, but I intend to spare myself the pain of a second episode.,The red haired girl was annoying!!! I just had to say that first. Also, they are teenagers so they do stupid stuff like scream at each other and fight one another during a zombie apocalypse. There\\'s also some pretty intense scenes that can cause some emotions like the little child running from her mom. Whew. That was intense. Overall it was a great series and no one was safe including the main characters.,This is one of best zombie series I have ever seen, I love the South Korean take on the zombie genre. Extremely well done makeup and special effects and refreshingly unique story line.,1. When everyone comes down from the classroom through a hosepipe, then the end of the hosepipe is only up to the window, but later in some scenes that pipe is shown from the window to the bottom.2. When everyone starts a campfire on the rooftop, On-jo is sitting with a blanket. While there was no blanket on the roof, where did she get it from?3. From the same window from which i-sak falls, everyone comes down through the pipe, but in a single scene, the dead body of her and zombie i-sak is not shown.4. In episode eleven, when Nam-ra feels hungry outside the construction site, she bites her hand. And in episode twelve, when she is separated due to hunger in the city, she bites her hand again, at that time the mark of the previous bite is not in her hand.,If you\\'re a fan of zombie show and won\\'t care about the quality/plot or any details - sure go for it.Also if you\\'re new to Korean shows and want to watch something go ahead\\r\\nHowever, if you\\'re someone who watches shows for the plot, direction, cinematography, stunts then I\\'d say this one was so disappointing.It looked great when the trailer was out. I was actually excited but the show is below average for me. The camera work was sloppy. Looks like it was shot way back in 2000 or the techniques they used were quite outdated not sure about that (still there were good shows with good quality before 2000s. So clearing that )\\r\\nBackground score is really not appropriate - it doesn\\'t sync with most of the scenes. Usually Koreans shows have amazing OST\\'s or background scores.The plot is terrible - Same typical plot (both school/zombie) there\\'s nothing new plus they tried to fit everything in the plot that it felt more of a school drama than zombie school drama\\r\\nThis may be a low budget show but still I\\'ve seen better shows with low budget!Anyway all I want to say is rather than watching this show and wasting time on it. Please watch Happiness (its of same genre but the plot is amazing - overall an epic show ) and thank me later 😋\\r\\nThis is coming from a person who watched countless number of Korean shows and is tired of basic plots - so don\\'t be offended if you liked the show. Since, most of the reviews are misleading to someone like me I just wanted to put it out there.,Despite all the horror, violence, blood and human entrails typical of zombie movies this story is really beautiful.True love and sacrifice, real friendship and team work and hope till the end. Characters both heroes and villains are very original, not super humans, super strong, super smart or super evil and emotionally unstable, nothing is exaggerated (which cannot be said about most of the recent productions where we simply see freaks, even protagonists). Compered to adults depicted in this story teenagers look more human in face of danger and despair and their strenght is not in their brains or muscles but in their hearts. Simple story and simple message nothing new but well told.Young Korean actors done really well. On-jo her character show us how delicate and infantile, maybe even weak person could be really strong and pure in the same time. The child and the adult in one person - teenager. All the rest are brilliant and original either.10/10 because this story is entertaining and smart, scary and touching, funny and sad, simple and yet deep and complex in the same time.In between high masterpiece and really bad movies lays the real cinema.,Budget looks good to make a well zombie tv season but what lacks is the direction and story telling! No focus on a single character and the character which they focus on are useless and get executed, giving a useless story telling and screenplay. Didn\\'t feel any adrenaline rush or scare. No powerful character, gets boring in between. Expected more from this high budget Netflix series and Korean drama.,It\\'s a disgusting series A lot of blood, and used concept.If it was in 2012 it would have been much better.I wish they came up with a new idea.///////////////,This TV series is very good. I just loved it. Every character played their role very effectively. I really enjoyed watching this masterpiece. Though it is a zombie movie, there are many scenes which might be disturbing for some viewers but if you are interested in these type of genre, you will fall in love with this. Story is very interesting, direction is super, cinematography is next level. A series full of thriller, horror, comedy, drama, emotions everything. It consists of 12 episodes and each episode is approximately of 1 hour. But i in these 12 hours, you won\\'t find it boring.,I fell in love with this movie from the 1st time watching the 1st episode. I got hook-up with the plot and finished this series within only 2 days. 9 episodes on the 1st day and 3 episodes the following day.Credit to all the hard work and the creative art presented in this series. I must say, exceptional acting, excellent directorship, great casting, cinematography, videography, deep script, editing, and the make-up artist are all incredibly appreciable.The storyline started to get intense from the beginning till the end. The crisis is presented in the form of the zombies caused by the Jonas virus.I love how they presented various characters of human beings when facing a crisis, and in this case, it is between life & death.Selfishness & selflessness are conveyed meticulously in every character. The human survival instinct influences human action, especially in the end, where the human-centric point of view decides to save humanity from extinction and sacrifices other beings as collateral damage.I love how every crucial message and critical learning are conveyed to the viewers. The issues with inequality treatment, bullies, minorities, politics, fear, bold, and proactive were included.I can\\'t wait for the 2nd season to come. I did watch other zombie TV series, but none are this great after Train to Busan.,Only 4 episodes in, its very dramatic but fun moments and zombie attacks everywhere, gonna keep continue watching this, any zombie lover and korean series watchers would love this one.,I started this show with very high hopes, as it\\'s first episodes shown well done Zombie action. The makeup was really great, the effects were cool, and overall, everything Zombie related was pretty well done. And although that persisted throughout the episodes, I must say that it\\'s script is, sadly, one of the stupidest, worst written and most obnoxious ones I\\'ve watched in a long time.Every time, every single time, a character opened their mouth or made any kind of decision, I just wished for all the cast to be eaten by zombies right then and there. Every single death from this first season was due not to the zombies themselves, but to every single character in the show having less common sense than a rock. Characters made the worst decisions they could have for every single scenario.This became extremely obnoxious half through the season, and the last two chapters I just straight skipped dialogue scenes because I couldn\\'t bear to watch more of the plot.The zombies are cool tho, so if you are a fan of the genre, I guess it\\'s still enjoyable to some extent. Just be prepared for the plot.,The storyline is ok, it points out bullying, cruelty of humans, but some of characters are just too stupid.They just stand there, not reacting every time there is an attack, especially the girls.Only the girl with an arrow knows how to kill the zombies, the rest just carry useless weapons like long sticks, and the annoying thing is most of them don\\'t use it to aim the head (come on it\\'s a zombie 🙄)-Useless death for some characters to make it more dramatic and sad.Poor decisions of characters that make you annoyed to death.,Preety bruatual show\\r\\nZombies are good\\r\\nStoryline is good\\r\\nEverything is good.Ithink all charaters are developed really awesomly in entire run.Those of u who are complainig\\r\\nThat else i was into and i am lost\\r\\nI say now is trash and its a not good show iwould say only only one word for them f$$ck off\\r\\nNo why u guys are really dumb\\r\\nEnjoy the fu$$king show and let creaters get the recognition they deserve.,Good story but they don\\'t rally dragged it out. Chronic overuse of the people running and falling. I don\\'t think Koreans are as inept at running as they portray. My gosh not one person could run without stumbling.,I tried to give this a chance but gave up half way through the third episode. The majority of characters are just annoying and why would you lock yourself in a room rather than try to get out of the school and make it for the high ground. Plus when they are faced with a Zombie why not just throw them out of that 4th floor window instead of using stools to try and pin them against a wall? It\\'s just one bad decision after the other and seems the director just stretched it out by having meaningless teenager drama. I just hope the lot of them were turned into Zombies.,One of the best netflix series. Why I really love it because of scenes which we never saw in american pop-corn movies. Like the best characters, whom we love from hearth, they also die (some of them). The evil is relativized. Also there are astonishing secrets, which we (viewers) know, but in the series, the characters never find out. You never know what will happens, full of surprises. Also the best in this series, there aren\\'t any force moral lessons. The things just happens, and you cannot say, what is good and what is bad behaviour, just like in real life.,It starts out corny, predictable, bad scripting (or English Translations), and the students making absolutely horrible decisions, or not thinking of or ignoring obvious solutions, but it is entertaining enough to get you to episode 3/4 and then things get so much better. You actually care about the characters and there is some great acting, even through some of the pretty terrible English Translations and tones used by the voice over \"actors.\"It is a very good series. You will be entertained. I do hope we get a season 2. This was up there with Squid Games for me as I got further into it, minus the mental illness of Squid Games lol.,Another master piece of Korean Zombie movies. After Train to Bushan this is a take to live the struggle to live. Average 12 hours are worth giving. All characters did strong enough to wait for next season. Among all this kind of movies realizes us that what is different to be a human. Relationship, family and friends. The sacrifices which worth to keep your beloved breathing.LOVED the 12 hours waiting for another.,Series named as adult drama but incidents happening from school. But teenages acted as matured adults. Faults are though; I feel some unnecessary feelings injected on the 2nd or 3rd episode of the series. 7 kids vs atleast 60 powerful zombies in a classroom with a barricade. Actress\\'s dad entry is not satisfying. They skipped so fast. Incubation period varies from 2 seconds to 1 week... Why?Otherwise overall series is a good... Cinematography, casting and making of the series are one of the best in industry. I have just 7 questions suggestions about the series that is I mentioned above.,I really looked forward to this Kdrama, I\\'m a huge fan of Korean shows and as always i\\'m thankful that I started watching this. I think I have it a 8/10 because I\\'m not a huge fan of zombie movies or series but after all it was really good.,Pleasee this series was made too cheesy like kids from high school with childish mindset and the main character was so arghhhhhh made me so feel bad..and the zombie like un natural.,I liked every thing about it besides watching zombies chasing people down a school hall for the 12,000th time! It still kept me interested and invested in the story but sometimes it did feel like a slog. Could probably have cut two episodes worth of zombies running around.,The friendship and their loyalty was the best thing that the show represents. When it comes to movie between life and death and you want the actors to make the best decision instead of irritating and selfish ones well this is it.Ive never been so satisfied with the characters and their decisions. Their loyalty, love, perseverance and tolerance. Each character brings so much presence in their own right.On the plus side. Park Solomon is easy on the eyes. And so are the rest. But he shines like never before.,... but not in a good way. Three episodes in and I\\'m tired of the students making horrible decisions. From standing around while another student turns, tolerating another entitled student, settling on a classroom on another floor when there were plenty on the way to choose from, putting your fellow students and friends in danger by not disclosing that you\\'ve been bitten to feeling depressed in the middle of it all when you should feel a sense of urgency. They say that if you can\\'t be a model by showing others how they should do things, be an example by showing others how they shouldn\\'t do things. This series falls into the latter category. The only redeeming thing so far is that there is a fighter and a thinker in the group. Everybody else is, pretty much, useless and a liability. \"#Alive\" and \"Train to Busan\" were more comprehensive. They had their flaws, but not to the extent of this series.,I\\'m halfway through the series \"All of Us Are Dead\" and say it\\'s a win for zombie aficionados everywhere. Like most flicks of its kind it makes you wonder, was humanity already brain dead well before the apocalypse hit?There\\'s a nice subtheme going on related to exam hell and the fact that students in Korea come out of 12 years of education with virtually no skills beyond those required for test-taking and punching fingers at SmartPhones.When watching this I can\\'t help think of the Sewol Ferry and how a paucity of critical thinking skills was at least a contributing factor to that completely avoidable tragedy. I have a feeling it was very much in the minds of the creators as well.I have a personal connection with Andong, where much of the movie was filmed, having spent 7 years teaching at the national university there. As a side note, on several occasions I tried to get my students on-board terrorizing the community with a zombie night in lieu of something called English Education night, a series of demanding performances which everybody seemed to loathe. This was way before zombie mania hit Korea in the form of \"Train to Busan\" and, now, \"All of Us Are Dead.\",I really liked this show. The actors were casted very well to their roles. The story was quite realistic as well as the characters\\' reactions, decisions and their zest for action following the outbreak. It was nice to see all of the characters evolve with the situation. 2 points deduction because someone fell every single time they ran somewhere and because of this annoying unkillable character.,I\\'m on episode 6 and I\\'m hooked because of the drama with strong sociopolitical messages, not because of the zombies.And Yes...it\\'s long, but who cares? Why you want it to finish it so fast? Take a chill pill and be grateful it\\'s as long as it is good too.Also, for the animals that complain about having filler, guess what?, fillers are intended for character development and world-building support.,As a big consumer of zombie subgenere, I always look for new stuff, and I really enjoied this one. However, it must be seen in korean and with subtitles, otherwise, it\\'s boring.,I don\\'t think I ever watched a zombie drama series that shook me, stressed me, saddened me and literally traumatized me as this one. The greatest zombie drama series of all time. Bravo, South Korea! You\\'ve got my respect!The actors? They really managed to show the angst and desperation of the characters do perfectly. Tje development of the characters is so well done it\\'s almost unrral. It\\'s like if they even exit the screen.The direction? Absoloutley bananas!The screenplay? The most fascinating writing of all time.The music? Haunting and provocative. Really adds to the atmosphere of the series.I can\\'t wait for Season 2 to come out, can\\'t wait to see more of the characters I now love.,Cons : Probably just my own preference but, i cant stand teenager acting, and even with decent time for character development, they still cant make me to care about them.Pros : if you dont expect great acting or memorable character/story and only try to find decent zombie movie/tv-series, its watchable.They should put the drama genre down, its far from train to busan, even if its only 2 hours movie, the character development better than this.,But all of the characters are soo insanely stupid. That mom on the scooter lol. None of them are making any sense and the zombies cant break glass for whatever reason?,The story is very generic, predictable and monotonous. There isn\\'t much going on except for a few scenes of violence. The zombies are okay, the humans are as dumb as you can expect them to be in a zombie movie, I would say even dumber than most movies. They fight among themselves, they have a tendency to exhibit wisdom after the event. Their actions don\\'t make any sense at all. All in all, this is a very long and tedious watch. Don\\'t waste your time like I did.,Although I am almost 50 I really enjoyed this series. The Korean have proven they ate great story tellers and can do it with smaller budget. But what I really liked is the healthy\\r\\nethical and sensible message. And of course it\\'s a bit over the top but to make a point you have to be more clear. The story uses the zombies to get the point across but it could have easily a war situation it\\'s the same thing. How in desperate times you need to come toghether. How vanities and personal loss take an other place in your ego. How friendship is michorw fragile than a social media post. How it feels if you let thing be unset. How everybody deals with stuff differently.,How are people giving it high ratings. It just makes no sense.I read some of the disapproving reviews and I pretty much agree with them but a couple of things I would like to point out that nobody\\'s taking about.1st is that how the hell did a teenage girl went through 9 months of pregnancy and no one noticed.2nd is that how did they go about fighting zombies, jumping up and down buildings and such without consuming any food whatsoever.I mean I get the fear for your life and adrenaline rush and all that but still you can\\'t go on like that for days without food.,Over all I believe it\\'s a well done series.One thing I did notice that was completely wrong was the students debating the meaning of the distress signal S-O-S. They are debating this in the episode where they\\'re on the school roof top. The female student who\\'s father was an EMT says that SOS doesn\\'t mean anything, that it\\'s not an acronym. It does in fact stand for SAVE OUR SHIP.Not sure the writers can get more than one series out of this. Just my opinion.,Relation between Korean Series & Zombies are always great.. Love to watch this show. I\\'ve completed almost 50% of episodes. And this is very awesome 👍 I like it... Koreans really know how to make movies & series with a lot of emotions... Want more content like this 😁,When it\\'s come to South Korea series, There\\'s always fans who voted 10/10 instantly.Some character is annoying as hell with no backup reason. Some character can be so dumb in one scene, and be so smart in the next scene.If you don\\'t like to watch series with a bunch of stupid decisions and stupid plot, you will not enjoy this series.Btw, I\\'m actually a South-Korea Series fan, but not this one.,They just scape of the dead using doors and windows against the zombies..., everyone is screaming and eating each other alive..., they are covered in blood....And the only thing that they do is to talk about date each other.Yes I lost 2h of my life watching and they will not came back.,This is how a zombie series is made really. It was soo good, it got me hooked from the very start. The characters were just too good. The decisions considering their age seems justified. But some scenes were very comical, and stupid but those can be easily overlooked because I loved this.,The series is very wonderful and luxury, it is full of action, mystery and zombies, it was as if I lived the atmosphere like them, here I learned the value of teamwork and how to survive without food or drink.,Survivors are ignoring their instincts. Characters\\' deeds are not logical. For the eleven episodes, no one decided to make a weapon to fight zombies. I watched that with embarrassment. Good CGI, though. If you like movies where people only run from place to place, mainly doing stupid things on the way, this one is definitely for you. Great potential lost miserably.,If you\\'re a fan of the Zombie genre then you should enjoy this. Good mix of character development, gore and thrills.If you\\'re looking for something to watch and a fan of the genre then this will be right up your alley.,You know korea has made many amazing zombies movies and they never disappoint us. This movie is also one of the best zombies. You should definitely try this.,A lot of k-drama fans too supportive about all k-dramas but this is kinda disappointed and STUPID. I\\'m sorry but usually Korean actors are great but in this series it\\'s so embarrassing and awkward, storyline is stupid and even the zombie is faster but the story is too slow. 12 episodes of NONSENSE.,What a story... It\\'s marvellous every episode is very interesting and very emotional when someone turned into zombies.. Especially your favourite characters... Hatts off such an exciting, engaging, n thriller story...wait for season 2.,I do like this show alot for what it is. The plot is engaging and emotional and the action scenes are exciting I just have one problem with it that was frequent throughout. If you\\'re one of those people that hate when people make dumb decisions in scary movies you will agree with me here. There is way too much standing around when people should be running away.. and does somebody have to coincidentally fall down every time they are running to add suspense? If someone you know gets bitten do you really need to stand there and cry for 5 min while zombies are actively chasing you. Just so many situations where common sense in a survival situation is just thrown out the window and it just kills me sometimes lol. But besides that I\\'d say this is overall a good zombie show and despite my criticisms I still binge watched the whole thing as apparently I still wanted to see more/what would happen next.,I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie.,I think it\\'s a well-made zombie movie. Since South Korea is a country where civilians are illegal to have guns, there is no such coolness to shoot and kill like ordinary zombie movies, but I think the tension from the situation where there is no specific way to respond was the best.,I have seen enough of this, from Train to Busan, Kingdom, and now this. Same scenery where there is Zombie rampage, massive zombies chasing\\r\\nHuman by running away for their lives...after the second episode, I stopped watching it.,Overrated to be honest. The best zombie kdrama is still the original KINGDOM! Nothing new to see here ... for 2022 there is other drama that is worth to watch than this. Definitely a No and will not waste my time watching this.,This is such an accurate and credible zombie apocalypse . Some of the bad points are that THEY KEEP TRIPPING AND FALLING, how they survived without such low amount of food and water and how they could\\'ve saved more people. Other than those ,this this Korean gore genre and absolutely loved the deaths, sacrifices and suspence.,Too excited for this show and maybe that was why I was disappointed. Non stop watched to ep. 3 trying to get into the storyline and characters, and although it gets better after each episodes, both storyline and characters so far are unremarkable. Too many holes in the plot, timeline all wrong.. Some of the main characters are so annoying that I rooted for the zombies.Nevertheless, the zombies are great and it is definitely entertaining so I would grudgingly finish watching this.,Headline says it all.What\\'s the connection of the pregnant woman? Just to show a teenage child who got pregnant and still tried to save her child? I don\\'t get it, the girl didn\\'t even have connection to the main characters though.Second, the scene where rat(?)/ hamster(?) came near to onjo\\'s feet,what does it mean? Does her blood is the cure to the disease? Overly used.You can notice unnecessary scenes if you are paying attention to the main point of the events. Also, characters is kinda NO NO for me.,The first episode was difficult to watch due to bullying and sexual assault. To begin with the story draws you in and you want the characters to be able survive the zombies apocalypse.As the story continued the characters stories are all intertwined from a horrific event. The overall question became will theses characters be able to survive each other and zombies.,A different kind of zombie story with good actors and lots of goore, but suffers from inconsistence wrighting.Interesting plot, realistic science and creative tactics.Stupid characters, ridiculous logical decisions and lots of plot holes.All in all a show i recommend to watch, if you can stand people screaming all the time while still trying to hide from flesheating zombies attracted to sound.,I had high hopes for this one, but I am disappointed after watching one episode. The scriptwriter had to make the characters act so stupidly and make a bunch of dumb decisions so the story could go on. The storyline is cliche and not believable. The only positive thing I can say about this is they are trying to raise awareness of bullying, which is a common issue in Korean society.,It made me feel that it was something really fresh from the genre.Before delving into why I thought it was good, let\\'s stop for a second to remove the basic prejudice about zombie movies.A lot of people are saying it\\'s yet the old zombie trope and same old thing again. \"Characters trying to survive and dying one by one.\" But I don\\'t think it is fair to compare or judge it that way.It\\'s like saying oh this action movie is about characters fighting, then other action movies including characters fighting cannot be good. Or this drama is about a character\\'s life story then other dramas about other characters lives\\' story is not innovative because both are telling life stories about a character.I am a huge zombie fan, and have watch most of the zombie shows/movies.Obviously the premise is the normal zombie premise but what made the show differentiate from the rest, is the other elements added into it such as character depths, morals, love, hope, hate and friendship. There are characters that will make you laugh, cheer for, like, hate and also get annoyed at. Which in itself is a success because it made you feel that way.It also had twist and turns that are not used in many other zombie flicks. And I have to say as an avid zombie veteran, I was taken by surprise more than a handful of scenes. (Which is not easy at all since I have seen most of them.) And if it managed to make you immediately want to click on the next episode to see what happens next, it has also succeeded.Yes, it got it\\'s bad moments sometimes, can be slow, stupid decisions are made and also a few plot holes. But those are forgiven in the grander scheme of things. The cinematography was beautiful, zombies really well made, acting was amazing by such young actors and action sequences realistically done. And again, in this \"overdone\" genre it managed to be fresh from the rest and made me think about it after the credits were rolling. For a zombie series, it deserved a 10 for me.,Is by far the best thing about this show, that kid was a legend! Ha.Was actually routing for him in this......but I can\\'t figure out how the squid game girl looks about 10 years younger in this ?,I do love watching anything Korean and zombies thrown into the mix was a bonus I really enjoyed it was was glued to the TV all day. Ignore the negative comments and give it a try and then decide for yourself. 😉😊,I went in with high hopes, as I\\'m a fan of just about everything zombie, especially South Korean. I wasn\\'t really feeling it after the first couple episodes (maybe 6 stars), but as the characters and story developed it got significantly better. I was hooked by the end of it. Would have probably given it an 8 had it started as strongly as it finished, so I\\'m splitting the difference with a 7.,So if you have 10 hrs to waste approx you can go ahead and watch this series just meaningless waste of time. After all this hype and korean drama suppose to be good.doesnt come even near our expectation.lame plot its like a loop same thing happening again and again.with same character.not a woth watch.,People are running and tripping in such clumsy way that I ruins the show. Many things does not make sense, to much illogical activities. But better than TWD at least.,My favourite zombie series is Kingdom and train to Busan is far better than most western made zombie movies. Also Squid Game was very good, however, that does not mean that everything from Korea will be awesome and that we should like it just because of that.All of us are dead is not good not bad, it has some interesting scenes, yet it feels that it should not have been 12 episodes... same issue that the walking dead had when people would rave about how \"deep\" the characters were, when in reality they did just have a lot of unnecessary dialogue and filler content that do not give the characters anything.I found myself skipping through by the end.Oh yes and one of the bullies is overdone on how many times he comes back.. it just annoyed me by that point.It is meh in one word.,It was ok to watch but incredibly stupid descisions made me fast forward a lot. People sacrificing themselves unnecessarily or someone seemingly forgets there\\'s a zombie apocalypse, or how about telling a carrier off he virus \"the next time you feel the urge to eat someone, eat me!\"\\r\\nMilitary personnel shooting themselves AFTER beating the zombie outbreak (success=suicide?).Also, EVERYONE know how to kill a zombie, you mess up the brain. Still, everyone with a blunt weapon go for the arms or the back or the legs. I can go on and on and on, the show is incredibly dumb a lot of the time, making me facepalm and press fast forward. Even though all of this it was ok to watch. Just ok.(I like zombie stuff in general),When I first started watching this show I was interested in the plot. The first few episodes were really promising, like something big was going to come in the future. Well that never came. After the first half of the show, it became stale and the main characters took every wrong decision possible without any reason at all, which led to them getting killed of.Another thing that bothered me is that the main characters ignored the fact that the zombies could be killed by stabbing them to the neck, although some of them did it a lot of times. I mean like nobody said \"Hey the zombies can be killed by stabbing them to the neck, maybe we should just kill them instead of pushing them\".Good try but not enough. 6/10.,First of all, the effects are good, even though the idea or the plot itself is not original, still an interesting premise to watch. HOWEVER, the characters are unlikeable, so many inconsistent things happened, the more you watch the plot is getting messier, so many dumb actions performed by the characters, like what? Wasting 15 seconds to shot a terrified face for each student while they can actually just throw the zombie out fast is dumb, really dumb. The love triangle doesn\\'t even help with the characters chemistry. So yeah, disappointing.,I don\\'t get those people giving bad reviews about All of us Are Dead! I enjoyed every episode from start to finish. It never loses its momentum. In fact, 12 episodes to me are not that long. I am hoping for a season 2.This show covers everything relevant to societal issues like the pandemic, bullying, political influence, pressure of getting into college, family relationships, friendship, love, human behaviours. I love how they included the youtuber character because he\\'s not just for comedy but it\\'s a reality that people would do stupid thing just for social media views.I like how they got into detail of the origin of the virus and the mechanism of the virus. Most zombie movies don\\'t go into detail with the origin of the virus (usually it\\'s chemical spill and things like that).Each episode keeps you wanting more and the actors played their parts perfectly. The female protagonist, On-Jo is a very realistic character. She\\'s not one of those badass superhero frontal heroine but like most of us, she\\'s an ordinary girl who has to deal with the pain of losing loved ones and yet keep going for the ones who are still alive.This show isn\\'t just about surviving or killing zombies. It shows you every human relationship. In this show, although they show you how cruel humans can be, it also highlights the good side of humans and how one is willing to sacrifice for the good of others.The side stories are all put together very well, without spoiling the main plot. I disagree with the comments saying there are too many unnecessary plots or characters because every side story has an impact and every character has a story to tell.Plot wise, acting wise, visuals, effects, everything is phenomenal. 10/10 absolutely!,I really don\\'t understand the logic behind all of these good reviews. Only watched two episodes and I couldn\\'t find myself to finish the rest. The concept was good but watching a show where all the characters are dumb af is extremely aggravating and makes you want to throw the remote at the screen. Every character makes stupid decisions and just stands there and does nothing the entire time. This show was a joke. Nothing compared to the masterpiece of train to Busan.,It actually started off great. Interesting characters, very creative cinematography, and great acting. But as the show went on, it got dumber and dumber with plot holes, bad writing, inconsistencies and things that just don\\'t make sense. I was hoping this would be a Korean \\'series\\', along the likes of Kingdom, Extracurricular, Stranger, Squid Game to name a few. But instead it\\'s just a \\'K-drama\\' with zombies. To give credit where credit is due; the acting for the most part is excellent. The cinematography (at least in the earlier episodes) is very creative, especially the one take sequence in episode 2. The stunts by everyone (especially the zombie actors) is incredible and the action choreography is excellent. Just wish it was written and directed better.,At first I thought it\\'s.just another zombie tv series, after I watched a couple episodes, I found it\\'s more than just blood, fight scenes. It goes deep into humanity, friendship and family, the good hearted contracts with evils. And the emotional journey it takes you through is just astonishing, especially when a father tries to save his daughter and sacrifices his own life, a mother rushes into the danger zone just to see if her son is ok, a son sees his own mother turned into a zombie and tries to bite him and fights with his classmates not to hit his mother, the humanity and the emotional journey resonated with me and I\\'m sure it would resonate with any one who has a family.,There\\'s some really fun zombie action in here. The way they turn is violent and well-made, and camera and sound are great! That is about it though.The dialogue is mostly a cringe fest, the decisions the characters make are even too dumb for high schoolers and the story is slow and just really meh.There\\'s also some attempts at humour, but those shots mostly miss, like 99% of the time.Can\\'t recommend, except if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.,The first 3 episodes i wasnt liking it, it was good to get a laught or two, was lacking so many things like characters with brains, but after watching it all i started liking it, obv so many things dont make sense like decision making of the characters, some stupid sacrifices, some scenes lack zombies and characters talk a lot and scream. If you like entertainment this is good, now story is cute but nothing that good of a masterpiece, i would rate the story a 4/10, could be better.,I was expecting a good zombie series. The setting is not bad.Most of the characters are useless.There\\'s nothing interesting. Boring. Bad script.Some of the kids are not good at acting.,I think the director was forced to kill atleast one main character in each episode...literally one or 2 main character/s die in each of the episodes.....and the origin story was basically trash ,but the school plot was quiet interesting that makes you watch the whole season....so that is it....conclusion: the origin story could have been better.,Good lord. I know horses for courses but what do folk watch besides this to give it 7+? It\\'s sooooo hard to like.The dubbing . It\\'s the reason the script is painful. Maybe.The uniforms. It\\'s the reason the characters are generic. Perhaps.The age of the characters. Is why they stand around and or make the same stupid descisions again and again . And again. And ... again.. and again...\\r\\nand aga...... if you hate my review, the .... oh and again....\\r\\nAnd again...\\r\\nYou get the point.This. Series. Is dull .even when it\\'s exciting I couldn\\'t care what happens to these unlikable YA.s and their dull melodrama. The adults of course are worse.Now saying that over many many days and dull evenings I did get to episode 8 (only)out of 12!!!! Wtf. And then I realized life\\'s to F Ing short. So I even stopped hate watching.I\\'m sure it\\'s fun for a lot of people but if you think you may get bored when you see a scene again...and again.... I\\'m here to save you your time.Switch off.,I had a high hope that this could be next \"Kingdom\" or \"Train to Busan\" but unfortunately it\\'s not.However, if you haven\\'t watched \"Kingdom\" or \"Train to Busan\" yet, This TV series could be a good start for you to become a Korean zombie flicks.,This movie helps you in future if this situation showed in TV series if that would in occure in real life. You could learn each life saving ways vey closely. During watching this series please drink water because it will forget you.,This was a great 12 episode TV show for me.If you like Train to Busan and Kingdom, this is a great show for you.This show is a treat as it has tons of gore.There are some plot holes or things that didn\\'t make sense but overall this is another Korean show that will go in my top 10 of awesome zombie shows/movies.Cannot wait for season 2.,One Of the Best Web Series I ever Seen.... Fully drama, action, suspense a complete full package series.... Waiting For Season 2 Soon....\\r\\nWe Want Season 2 All Of Us Are Dead 💯💯💯,A little bit more thrill was expected. Although had a great time. It was not just about zombies. Ahh so much sacrifices, some felt unnecessary. Chemistry of those characters was very charming.,In the beginning it looks like it\\'s a masterpiece, but it\\'s not. I could give 8 stars if it had a good ending, a lot of people die, ok, it\\'s expected from a zombie series, but you\\'re not expecting the best character to die, it\\'s just ridiculous. You can watch it from the episode one to number eleven, after this, this series sucks. People like happy endings, or at least an Easter egg that something good can happen, but this series just failed.,Please watch 1ep for 1day.if one at a time it feels boring\\r\\nSome Repeat fights, but story is a some little bit unique.Camera work is best, You need Spoiler 😂😂😂,,I love zombie movies not the low budget and corny acting zombies.. but TRAIN TO BUSAN WAS MY FAVORITE ZOMBIE MOVIE OF ALL TIME even though it\\'s a foreign movie THAT SAYS A LOT... (Also watched the movie 5 years late after its first released)...\\r\\nBut this show ALL OF US DEAD... people disliking this show.. lack wisdom and emotion... when this show had all the above.. including hidden messages about humanity in general if you really are paying attention.. to the casting crew, script writers and director.. VERY WELL DONE!!! Koreans films are no joke! Love it! I want season 2 ASAP!!!,This is number 1 zombie show recommended. This series deserves recognition. The zombie kid actors are beautiful and perfect for roles. Favorites is Namra and HyuSeok. Please More more of this couple should be. More cheesy moments to mix with scary tension. The cinematic scenarios are good. There are many tense moments... Funny sometimes and mostly scary because of the running chasing and gore. Namra should show more of her powers. More actions running please...and i hope the writers add more survival survival techniques . This is nice to watch with Girlfriend or Friends or family .. Enjoy and scream same time.,The zombies are active, very agile and can run fast, which is very important because it will make the audience tense to watch it, even though the content of the story is not as good as the first train to busan, but this is better than the walking dead with weak zombies, hopefully another story will emerge zombies from south korea.,Loved it from start to finish. Every episode leaves with suspense. I recommend this everyone to watch it. You never get bored from start to finish. Waiting for season 2./,This is not just another spin off on the zombie genres. The Koreans have given it a twist and added lots of emotional elements to it. One can relate to each and every character in this series. I am shocked at the talent coming out of South Korea - how do they find such great actors? Each and every person has put so much effort and it shows throughout the 12 episodes. The scale is huge and Netflix has put lot of money in this. Please watch it straightaway if you haven\\'t already.Me and my wife are looking forward to season 2 already :),The Movies should be an example for real life, but this movie show a bad morality in each character on their movies. It\\'s a shame, a movie like this should be able to set a good moral example for the audience.So many korean movies like this.,It\\'s not a terrible show . But seriously , how can they make these characters so idiotic . The girl that killed the classmate with the cloth was one of the worst characters I\\'ve ever seen in a show. I nearly had to stop watching after her first few scenes. Then we get to the character on the roof that can hear them talking on the other side of the door then tells the Blackhawk soldiers with guns that there\\'s no one left ? Like seriously , even in a life and death situation , no one would ever do something like that . It\\'s absolutely ridiculous. The people at rotten tomatoes giving this show 100% must not have brains, cuz it would be impossible to give this show a 10/10.,I enjoyed but i found the story was streched unnecessarily,the same sort of thing kept happening and happening and this could be ended by epi 11,but again streched unnecessarily for the 2nd season.,Thrilling and entertaining series. Great acting by each one of the characters, infact few characters are brilliant. Nice story line, A must watch one👍🏻,This is easily the best Korean drama I\\'ve ever seen. The action is sustained, well-paced and highly engaging, the stunt choreography is arguably the best I\\'ve seen across any genre, any country, and the acting and script are top notch. It avoids the repetitive and expositional motifs of a lot of Korean tv, doesn\\'t have any significant filler and manages to keep saccharine moments to a minimum for what is mainly a high school horror drama. The episodes fly by despite being either side of an hour in length, and while I would love a 2nd series, it sits perfectly as a stand-alone. The zombies are scary and amusing at the same time, it has mastered Korean tv\\'s knack for intrinsic comic timing, and the villains are genuinely intimidating. Also the best zombie tv show I\\'ve ever seen, tonally it\\'s more 28 Days Later than the Walking Dead (thank god). 100/10, would recommend.,If you\\'re looking for some \\'Train to Busan\\' kind of horror or action, then walk away because the movie isn\\'t for you.Not every zombie movie or show has to have the same storyline; it can either be funny like \"Zombieland,\" serious like \\'\\'World War Z\\' or be in the form of a TV series like \"The Walking Dead.\"It depends on your preferences. Speaking of \"All of Us are Dead,\" it\\'s a decent watch if you\\'re into survival genre and you have nothing else to watch at the moment.In addition to that,\\r\\n1. It\\'s based on a popular webtoon\\r\\n2. The effects are good\\r\\n3. It\\'s only 12 episodes, unlike some TV series with 16 plus.,A story of a father\\'s frustration towards his son not being able to fight back against bullies lead him to create a virus that improves a persons animalistic nature and craving for violence.Although this movie trended worldwide, the step back to how old zombie movies were portrayed was really annoying. The sheer number of \"pause before you act\" moments is the total opposite of how humans act when in danger. One student even mentioning he watched Train to Busan, but still did not know how to act when being hunted by zombies.Also the way the script tries to insert love story has cause the film to be flimsy at times. Givent he fact that these are kids, i can understand that crushes and love are a big deal for them, but i find it irrelevant on this film.Another issue i find with this film is the way they include a \"final boss(Gui-Nam)\" in an already convoluted story. Yet, the final goal of the antagonist was really shallow. Fight sequences usually involves people standing and doing nothing while watching their friends being beaten up.And lastly if you expect a solution and/or a happy ending for this story, there is none. This is the most common way for directors to tell you, \"to be continued...\"Overall, it\\'s a good take on the horror of how a government, it\\'s policies, and humans react when their lives are on the line. This movie is good, but would have been better.On a side note, please please can\\'t zombie movies have intelligent protagonist. It\\'s 2022 people, most individuals should have watched one or two zombie movies already.,Just got done watching the first season, it was really amazing, I love the drama and sadness. It was very tense. Bone cracking throughout the whole scenes, I\\'m hoping the Director does bring season two This was way better than squid game.,Great story and very relatable characters, even tho some of them are incredibly annoying but that just gives more points to realism of charachter diversity. 10/10.South Korea really made them self a king when it comes to zombie genre with entries like Train to Busan, Kingdom and now this beautiful gem.,Just binged the and to be honest ,I loved it. A little slow in places with the guilty party being the romance side of things as mayhem and carnage was being carried out just a doors width apart,but I guess to inject sum humanity into the series these parts were justified. Overall it\\'s what it says on the tin,well acted ,filmed well,the mass zombie assaults were extremely well done,all the extras were obviously having a ball.Great series ,I\\'d highly recommend this.,First moment, it started well but by going end of it, it becomes miserable Korean emotional drama.I couldn\\'t understand characters, I couldn\\'t understand their decisions. Over actings against their families and friends made feeling so stressed.Too much dramas for zombie action. The original webtoon was kind of this, but they shouldn\\'t apply this kind of unnecessary things.And why they chose those bad actors?,It\\'s unsurprising that another excellent show tackling the zombie genre has tumbled out of South Korea, yet again showing us that the undead category is still alive and kicking.I can sing this shows praises to the moon and back with truly excellent camerawork focusing on complex wide sweeping shots condensing down into close ups all in one take, not to mention a clearly competent directorial team on deck. The setting is, although fairly overdone in zombie media (a high school), showcased to us in a fairly fresh and interesting way, with plenty of background building before the main outbreak occurs and a very in depth look at the good and bad already occurring at the school.That being said I absolutely need to address the few issues this show has sadly, they aren\\'t small. While the acting is decent enough to not ruin the immersion, actually on the contrary it ranges from decent to fantastic, the stupidity that runs rampant absolutely is. Characters suffer from the zombie flick stereotype of suddenly forgetting all common sense until it is absolutely crucial, survivors have to be taught the absolute basics of survival despite stating several times that they\\'ve seen zombie movies, they reference Train to Busan for gods sakes but don\\'t know how to push a table against a door until a teacher arrives?It\\'s also a shame that one of this shows greatest strengths also becomes its greatest weakness, as it\\'s ability to jump between separate survivor groups is seamless and anticipated, it is also annoying at times and very much unnecessary. Without going into detail there are entire character arcs pushed in to the already overcrowded narrative who don\\'t contribute to the story and serve no purpose to anything other than a small emotional hit to the viewer. That\\'s all. Unnecessary and very annoying to watch. It also must be said that the animation, a thankfully minor part of the mostly prop/makeup based effects, is laughably bad. Luckily it is only used sparingly.Overall, however, I am thrilled at the end results and despite the aforementioned issues, I can\\'t wait to bite into more. Hopefully season 2 will be just as frantic and exciting!,There is a LOT of drama in this show which at times was a little bit hard to believe because there\\'s an actual zombie apocalypse happening and these high school kids are still worrying about \"who likes who\" and throwing temper tantrums and the protagonist girl giving the cold shoulder to the protagonist guy who has a major crush on her.I also really didn\\'t like how it seemed like the most important person to save during the entire show was On-jo. So many people sacrificed their lives for her and yet she was being so selfish throughout the entire show.But I was willing to look past all of that, as long as they were going to let my man Cheong-san get the girl in the end. But NOPE! They made Cheong-san a simp for On-jo the entire show and then the second she finally starts treating him right, they kill him off.I don\\'t know if this is typical in K-dramas but they made a lot of the guys weak, timid, bumbling buffoons. There was A LOT of female-on-male violence which was more than annoying and the males were always scared of the females and just took their beatings like wimps.There were significantly more female students alive at the end than males, so it promotes the idea that males are expendable and should sacrifice themselves for the females, but also that the females were smarter and better survivors.I\\'m also mad about them killing off some of the best characters. Like for example they killed off the scientist who created the virus pretty early when he could have played a bigger role in the show. On-jo\\'s dad spent the entire show trying to find her, he finally finds her and then gets bit within 2 seconds of finding her.The episodes are long (around 1hr each) and there is 12 of them so it starts to get a bit exhausting with all the drama but the ending was okay because they left it open for a sequel season but at the end of the day.I enjoyed the show at times and was annoyed at other times so that\\'s why it gets a 5/10. If they let my man Cheong-san live and get the girl in the end it would\\'ve been a 7/10 but they did him dirty. Lived and died a simp. Shameful.,After watching it, we can be sure there won\\'t be any season 2. Cause they finished it beautifully. But still hoping for another season. You should also watch the lead actress\\'s (Ji-hu)\\'s great masterpiece \"House of Hummingbird\",There are many zombie movies already for us. But it is simply superb....👌wonderful acting.. not a slow start at all....must give a try for to this fabulous series... And it gonna be a best series like sucide squad....,This series just feels so real, and everything happened in it can be convincingly happening in real life, this is what most zombie series are lack of. And another thing this series is good at is the action scenes, they really did a great job.All characters in this drama is depicted well, with their distinct personalities, even those characters that only appeared once or twice. The main characters also got distinct personalities and each of the acted very well, that\\'s what we need for a zombie drama, because a zombie drama without deep character development can be pure brainless entertainment with lot\\'s of gore and violence only.There\\'re also shortcomings in this series, especially in mid sections of this drama, everything gets a little boring, however, the plot is getting more and more attractive as the plot goes on, and it can still hook audiences without much action scenes involved.Overall, this series is a great zombie series with great action scenes, and a decent plot with deep character development, it\\'s a zombie series with good production value.,It\\'s definitely one of the better zombie flicks. The acting is great, the story is good. I would have given it a 7 or 8 if it weren\\'t for two very annoying things, that I couldn\\'t get past:1. They had literally nothing to eat or drink for what seemed more than two days, while half the time running, fighting zombies, climbing up and down buildings, and parkouring. Non of them seemed pretty fazed about that and apart from a few comments, the lack of vital sustenance in a zombie apocalypse, was considered pretty much like an insignificant detail, rather than the difference between life and death.2. Decision making and reactions were at points absurdity itself. Someone is bitten, turning, and will kill us all - let\\'s stare and see what will happen - that, on more than one occasion. Zombies are attacking my friends - let me stare for a while and then hit them with a book. We have to make other split second decisions - again let\\'s stare. There\\'s a lot of staring going on.Overall, however it\\'s a good movie if you get past this and some other annoying details.,Watch it now would do anything to be able to watch it for the first time again i feel empty whenever i\\'m not watching this but i feel like the shouldn\\'t of killed off cheong su. And should\\'ve included more scenes of su hyeok (bare-su) and isak should\\'ve died a bit later on so it was more emotional. Diffenatley recomend want to be nam tamra tbh.,This web Series Batter then other Zombie web series.And i really like this all characters.spacial Nam-ra an gwi-nam. And This series want a 9/10 Rating.An I want know about last scene..?An I\\'m very excited for second Season.,Not your usual train to Busan spread over 540minutes Zombie fiesta. You\\'ll be disappointed.The starting looks promising, like most Korean shows. It escalated once the kidnapped student got her first bite. From then on, hell broke loose and quick. But I don\\'t buy the story of this outbreak not reaching outside the city given the modern instant tech we have now. You\\'ll telling me thousands of student though surrendered their phones for class and not one of them has a stealth phone somewhere??How the capital, Seoul and their white house and no international coverage was mentioned for outbreak of this scale is beyond me.Plot holes are too constant as show progress. The main cast of students all live like cat\\'s life, outwitting speedy zombies throughout the show without a scratch hardly, with sometimes 1V1 fend off. Bear in mind these students hadn\\'t had a meal or sip of water for days yet their adrenalin never seems to wear off.The Shakespearian little romances between some of them are putting me off so much that I fast forward to the action most of the time. Who has the time to confess to their crush when you not eat drink or poop in days, stinky all over with cracking lips?!Director could have spare us the melodrama and trim this down to 8 eps of pure adrenaline pumping thriller.Visual is good don\\'t get me wrong. The acting skills of all the walking and running zombies deserves a shout out, more than the humans, yea and the director\\'s.Now many aspects of the show barely fit much of the logic, which plays a huge part to a serious film watcher like me.Why would Einstein the scientist ask the detective to retrieve his laptop for the remedy? When eventually, he mentioned there was none and only way is to wipe out, disintegrate the bodies. HELLO? Michael Owen moment there...Who decides how long the bitten will turn into zombies?? We saw 3 seconds, 3 minutes, 3 weeks (Genius girl) . Are they generically decided? Or environmentally?? Or to the director\\'s mood??And who decides who turns into a super zombie?? (Die hard cyclone, genius girl, bullied girl etc) they virtually have nothing in common! Intelligence or physicality wise. Pretty far fetched by now the story.And what do the zombies hunting based on? The sound as they put it? Visuals? Smells? If it\\'s sound they would have pound on anyone moving even fellow zombians ain\\'t it? If it\\'s visual they would pound on the super zombies as they still walk and look like humans. If it\\'s smell (they bypass super humans) they wouldn\\'t have to depend on sounds then! Directors discretion again I guess.Die hard cyclone was so annoying at first as he die hard.... But I kinda rooted for him in later stages as those students were a pain to watch by now with their forgettable escaping ideas. I just wise cyclone killed them all.And if genius girl aka Seline underworld had the power all along after turning into super zombie why can\\'t she put herself in the front for most escapades?? She\\'s strong as hell as seem in final stages (neck breakers so on) what a waste!It\\'s a shame I would have like to have see bullied girl super zombie take on cyclone for a kill bill showdown! They didn\\'t mentioned her whereabouts when the series ended. What a bummer. Not some Seline underworld flew away to the covenant OMG.Since the story was half wrecked by now, I may as well see a super zombie lover boy1 take on Cyclone! But that was not to be as well...What a letdownHere\\'s the likeable;\\r\\nLiam Neelson adventure to save her daughter was heart warming to see until the absurd tennis court get to the chopper moment. Okay before that, why he opened the hall door to see her daughter?? It could be dozens of zombies with all those hard banging! Directors answer this please.The detective or his sidekick actually. A humorous acting better than most of other characters. Brings a laugh whenever his seemingly cowardice character came back to help out!The little girl, saved by Ripley. What a performance and a tear jerker in the restaurant of her enduring the lost of the mother, now a walking dead.The Archery sis, aka Katniss Everdeen the only coolest human character I like in the show. Wish the show revolves around her slaying the dead instead of the many Shakespearian plays we had to put up with.All in all, if your in for entertaining purposes then this will probably work for you.For serious film watchers like me all the little nonsensical is a deciding factor on the overview.Season 2? Bring back die hard cyclone instead of loverboy1 please. And bullied girl super zombie has yet to unleash her potential. Make use of that.,This is the best Series i have ever watched . I Loved the series very much so i given this series 10 stars. When a first time zombie watcher Sees this series Then He will gain more respect for the Zombie community. Hope the season 2 comes Soon.,This is my fist review!If you are like me and misses the good old chaos of the walking dead this hits the spot! Currently on episode 4 and this buildup is exeptional. Bit slow the first two episodes but worth the wait. The actors make it fun to watch in the original language imo.,The plot is so fake like one moment they are just students and the second later they become super ninja letal killer\\r\\nAlso the characters are all so stereotyped is annoying!,I found this series quite interesting to watch with amazing graphics. The blood and zombie scenes are worth mentioning. Although the series gets boring at some times, and then exciting again, but over all I would say that it was worthy of my time, and you\\'ll surely like it, if you\\'re a zombie/blood/violence/thriller lover.Ps.I have also seen another drama, called Happiness (starring Park hyung Sik) personally, i liked it more, it has almost the same base of story, but the thing is, this series contains a hell lot of more emotions, which the above series is lacking. So yeah, DO WATCH IT TOO, i loved it!,A teacher who would rather save a psychotic murderous student than 7-8 normal kids who clearly need adult supervision and guidance.A mother who runs into a zombie apocalypse, and starts calling out zombies and then gets killed basically achieving nothingA so called bright student who clearly notices a fellow student infect a kind poor kid, but does nothing to stop it, waits for the kid to get infected and die, and then calls out the psycho as if she did anyone any favor.Characters who are so shocked all the time, they won\\'t even move when a zombie horde is coming at themBasically if you can think of all the idiotic decisions someone can take during a zombie apocalypse, they are all taken here.The writers use cheap emotional tricks to get you invested. If your characters exist only to take stupid decisions so that you can create manufacturered drama instead of organic ones, you failed as a writer.May be some like that, but i personally hate this show.,Yes -- I see you.This series was awesome.One of the better zombie movies for sure. It\\'s not one of those blunt zombie movies where people get eaten alive. The movie touches upon real societal issues, youth violence & crime, and class division. There are only handful of zombie outbreak movies out there that can even compare.Ugh so much blind hate.,I must say k zombies are the best . While a lot is going on but story and character development is still perfect . Also perfect camera work along with awesome direction.Great use of new faces (actors) and their acting is commendable.Overall a awesome awesome thriller to watch.,As korean i was disappointed.The original webtoon is more great than it.All story is boring.And it is cliché lump\\r\\nThere are too many useless scene.I don\\'t know why this drama is NETFLIX 1st.It is just for killing time.,Ive readed this manhwa and it was quite enjoyable. But ive noticed theres so much other things on this serie. Some of them are quite enjoyable, but at the other some arent. Pretty disappointed.,They set up the story with played out tropes without any original take on them (bullies and high-teen drama), and social commentary aspect takes over the believability of the story.,What was that?? I\\'m completely amazed, bruh.Ignore the bad reviews already. Just watch it for ur own fun.It\\'s Gory, and I loved it. Watched the first 5 episode. And it\\'s a good.,If you are bored and nothing to watch I\\'ll recommend this. But whenever that high school girl acting like damsel in distress i fast forward. Like come on, if you\\'re faced on this situation adrenaline must kick in and stop being like you need someone to save you. Her character is annoying.,This\\'s the slowest series I\\'ve ever seen in my whole like, even if this series was 4 episodes long it will still be a waste of time. I swear I completed the whole series in 2 hours by just skipping most of the scenes, btw I regret wasting these 2 hours.,All of us are dead movie is not just k drama movie it is a horror and goosebumps movie. It will give you just goosebumps. I just loved this movie and I am now exited for season 2.,From start to end, stupidity... Stupidity..... Stupidity.Senseless.Meaningless\\r\\nPredictable\\r\\nOverrated\\r\\nCraze about Korean looks might have created buzz.,Okay, so I started watching this series because me and my girlfriend kinda like zombie series.Korean is a weird language for us and the names are very hard to remember since (for me) they look all the same. I\\'m from The Netherlands. Me and my girlfriend didn\\'t know who was who. It\\'s difficult to explain but that made it very hard for us to follow the characters and their storyline. Also, the first scene was very strange and hard to watch. I hate bullying but this was from another level. Then I read Online that these kind of behaviour is kinda normal in Korea. That shocked us. Then girls were beaten by guys and raped. That just absolutely isn\\'t fun to watch.I watched three episodes. It was very slow-paced, cruel and felt weird. Train to busan (a very good Korean Zombie movie) was a lot better because it was character driven and there were just a few characters who had easy names to remember.This flick felt like a very cruel and bad script. We both wouldn\\'t recommend watching this. It\\'s literally horrible.We just finished Lost (the series) which was TERRIFIC. One of the best shows we have ever seen. Then we tried this and Archive 81, and those were just plain boring and bad.We both don\\'t recommend this series. Save your time and search for a better one (,I honestly had no idea of what I was getting into. I only recently got into KDrama so this is a whole new thing. But I\\'m not going to give this a 10 star as for my anger towards the huge unexpected plot twists! Yet in a way its intriguing and entertaining. I did cry about this show because of the way the main characters died, but I also was angry of how it\\'s displayed the term zombies. Sure its not a scientific explanation of zombies but I feel it could\\'ve been different by the normal stereotype. I did feel a little sick of how real it looks though!,Good series, great acting, annoying characters and absurd ending. The director and the cast and crew did a great job.I just didn\\'t like the way it ended.,Best zombie story ever.....the characters have played their role exceptionally and vfx+sound were on the next level\\r\\nCan\\'t resist watching it again and again........eagerly waiting for SEASON -2............with the news that Cheong-San is ALIVE<3<3Highly recommended for zombie lovers:)<3.,Talking but not saying anything real. Zombie lore acknowledged but no looking for resources. Fights that make no sense. Actions in general making no sense. This is just bad.,I did not expect to see a series that talks about zombies with this talk. It beat all my expectations. I really enjoyed this wonderful Korean, and the Koreans proved that they are the kings of zombies in their embodiment and their craftsmanship when they turn into zombies. It is a wonderful acting team and creativity from everyone as well as creativity from the author, director, script and dialogue that they are wonderful And they crush the Oscars. They presented this masterpiece with conscience, creativity, effort and obvious fatigue. I really enjoyed it and waiting for the second part.Thank you imdb team.,Over 12 hours for a zombie story!!!!! God it gets boring and repetitive after initial 2-3 episodes. After that it is just counting how different people becomes zombie and keep counting bodies. Too many subplots and hell lot of characters, unnecessary drag.,Very entertaining and engaging through the end.Cinematography and action scenes are fantastic.A new zombie variation gives some twist to the series.Total number of episodes could have been reduced, little lengthy.,Just finished watching the first episode (the series got released today). Started out with interesting character development and story building. One thing I like, and perhaps what may make this series different from other zombie series/movies, is that it tries to establish the similarities between domination of certain sections of people over the others in our society and dominant / invasive nature of parasites/viruses over other living organisms, irrespective of intelligence, consciousness or any other things.Will have to see how the rest of the series turns out to be. Hope it turns out to be another critically acclaimed Korean series, among so many others.,Great filming, great make up, great actors .A litle hard to believe \"5 guys cant brake a door , from wood and with tiny lock \" directors maybe think twice next time :(\\r\\nIn rest 10/10 good job !!!,If you want to see how it feels like to take 1 gallon of paint and try to paint a 3 story house with it, listen to this TV Show.There are sometimes good stuff, but there are some scenes that could have been definitly removed.,Decent zombie action but too much drama. What is 12 1 hour episodes could have been 6 45 minute episodes. Too much filler so after a couple episodes everything is too repetitive. The bullying trope is really corny and overdone. The main villain\\'s motives are unrealistic. None of the characters are likeable. I think this show is overhyped because of the \"squid game\" momentum that Korean shows have. Overall it is a mid series.,I\\'ve been watching zombie movies for 30 years. I have watched or attempted to watch every movie or show containing zombies.This one is definitely the worst. It\\'s pointless and ridiculous nonsense. I could only watch the first episode and less than ten minutes of the second one.This show is bad beyond compare.,This is way far better than all The Walking Dead seasons combined. Highly recommended for both who likes the zombie genre and those who doesn\\'t like it.This isn\\'t your usual, ordinary, zombie show. It\\'s full of character development, real life and realistic drama, and lessons in survival and life itself.,Half-baked story, good effects, bad realization.One logical fault follows by the next. I got annoyed too many times while watching the series. The series is very predictable. I was very disappointed.,Oh Korea what have you done?! You have ruined the good name for quality shows you once had by making this atrocious zombie tv show. Episode 1 was long enough to tell your story and end it and it may have been ok, but 12 episodes, wow. 12 episodes of the worst thing I have seen in many years. Congratulations.,As an avid zombie fan I put this in my top 5 best zombie shows / movies of all time. The acting from the zombies is phenomenal. It\\'s realistic feeling, blood everywhere, bodies slamming every which way exactly like it would be if this were real life. I have wondered in several scenes whether anyone actually got hurt, I mean they go HARD. Could the dubbing be better - of course, I\\'m yet to see a dubbed show or movie that couldn\\'t have been better however this is the best I\\'ve seen yet. I can only hope they make more like this.,If you want to slap your forehead every five minutes, this series helps you maintain the rhythm. I\\'m used to characters in horror movies and series making idiotic decisions, I really am, but this takes it to a whole new level. If this series tried to mock the stupidity of most horror flicks, it would be a fun little series, but unfortunately it tries to be serious. What a waste of time and brain cells. I don\\'t understand the high ratings, but to each their own I guess.,Like every zombie show, it starts good, with an interesting premise and good development. But like every zombie show, after the first/second act the characters become dumb, there´s a lot of plot holes, etc, etc, etc.The photography is pretty good and the acting is also not bad.,I watched all episodes. Overall it was a good watch. Sometimes it becomes boring too see some long conversations. They seem to be usesless. Yes i understand there is a philosophy about this show but they don\\'t need to smash it all the time.,Being an zombie movie how you can think to make it realistic. I think writer thought what if we face zombies as same as we faced covid..That lee na character you killed her in a funny way.. And then the father who fought so hard to reach and protect her daughter and you just give them hardly two minutes. She still remained the same with,You made the villain hero by killing cheosang.All of us are dead! How? You should kill all then, why some left\\r\\nComplete disappointment..,I liked the slow pacing here. Yeah some might get annoyed with this but overall the series was decent. Some scenes are pretty brutal, they didn\\'t hold back. There are some moves and consequences which annoyed me very. Some deaths and also few others things. Yeah it is fiction, but some parts were completely missing. But a potential season 2 has the chance to be much better.,Poor series, no clear story, its full if zombie killing action scenes are cool but no story at all, and 12 episodes is too long for this series. And in short time too many series/movies centered on Zombies where is the creativity ?,The show is mid and all imma say is, it\\'s the characters fault. It could have been good but 80% of the characters are written so dumb. Almost all of them are the female characters.At one point they\\'re trying to make a fire to warm themselves and they keep struggling for like 10 minutes and all of a sudden this one girl goes I have a lighter and I\\'m like b**** why u didn\\'t say that earlier. And there is that other girl who used to get bullied a lot, she got infected but isn\\'t a zombie, all she got are superpowers and she uses them to kill someone who comforted her a lot of times in the past infront of the military and other people. And then she gets shocked when the military dudes take her away and lock her up like bruh what u expect when u bite someone to death??? Stupid b****.,The main characters were not smart. They knew it was zombies, yet did not bother to smash the brains. Also, so many stupid decisions made by the characters - only to make everything more dramatic.,Loved the character arcs, the unexpected twists (literally nothing goes the way you\\'d expect it to for any character) a thoroughly enjoyable experience with a particularly poignant final episode. Cannot wait for season two.,I am a fan of zombie movies and series... you name it and probably I have seen it... Korean zombie concept is always high impact fast moving ones and this one was no exception to \"Kingdom\" or \"Train to Busan.Having said that, this series doesn\\'t deliver anything more than an average story. Originality of virus unclear, acting mediocre, ending typical. Tries to introduce some novel concept like \"intelligent zombie\" but could have been better.But still I gave 7/10 just because the plot was better executed than many other zombie series... a good one time watch probably. Notjing more.,Think Freakish and Walking Dead: World Beyond with the frequent intensity of Train to Busan, but so much better than the first two. Even with some of the cliched relationships and instances, this still felt much more creatively original than the garbage that\\'s come out of the US for the past decade.,Low budget and the story really sucks it is very slow. The characters are all very annoying, it\\'s just dumb. I think the writers like bullies. If you want to waste time getting annoyed you might want to watch this. This show is not for me.,From like 20 characters only 3-4 characters who have good acting, the rest is meh, many plot holes,and the story is average,the characters doing dum thing and that make no sense because it workwith that budget they should make a far better series than this,kingdom is far better than this if you want watch korean zombie.Character development is meh,\\r\\nthe only good character is the bully villain with white jacket, the annoying girl with pink jacket and the mc.The Dectetive,the one who good in fight,the Big boy,mc best friend,and class leader is decent,the rest team is trash, fmc trash, archer girl and her friends trashthe only good thing about this series is cinematography.,The one thing that makes me rate this show higher than most zombie shows, is the lack of stupidity needed to advance the plot.Sure, teenagers in a high stress situation make mistakes, but realistic and understandable ones.The higher ups have some hard decisions to make and are realistically conflicted about it.Even the highschool drama makes sense to me.,This show does a good job at drawing you in but then it moves incredibly slow. Lots of repeated scenarios and things happening that are never really followed up on. There\\'s a lot of potential for a good story with chances for deeper character development but it doesn\\'t seem like we ever get the satisfaction of these teenagers really learning anything? High production value. Prob won\\'t watch season 2 though.,Netflix\\'s bots are rating this up, otherwise I don\\'t understand how this could be a +7 / almost 8 serie. Do you a favor and don\\'t loose time with this one.,Honestly, everything is almost perfect but the reason I can\\'t give two more star is when the character fall over and trip again a few times. Second is when certain character decided to sacrifice themselves in hope to help the other but it\\'s just getting me pain. As example, when Cheong-san mother secretly arrived at the school, she called his son friend that already got bitten and I was shouting stoopid so loudly in front of my camera. Furthermore this drama drive me up the wall when Na-yeon murdered Cheong-san friend with a wipe of handkerchief that contain zombies blood and then all the hateful moments appears a lot and more to come. She is the cause of why the group created negative vibes and I hate it but I know every survival movies will always have that person. Anyway it\\'s worth to watch it and I\\'ve just finished this drama in four days. VERY RECOMMENDED! *of course we are waiting for SEASON 2, IT MUST HAVE, because the ending keep me hanging and questioning.......,Nobody does Zombie like the Koreans. The moves, the story, the acting all top notch.Train to Busan is one of my favourite zombie films of all time and this series is going to be one of my favourites too10/10.,There\\'s no congruency in the time required for the humans turn to zombies, some take seconds some take whole hours, there\\'s no realism in the state of the corpses after being clinically dead for days, no explanation as to why some people only partly turn to zombies and how the whole thing works except a few remarks about how the virus might have mutated (?).The actors are absolutely terrible, there\\'s almost no action whatsoever. It\\'s just full of teenage drama, and by teenagers I mean those weird kids in every class that nobody talks to and their problems.And for the love of Christ, what\\'s with the \"bad guy\" running around his classmates trying to kill them the entire series? Why? What\\'s his motivation? \"Aaaaargh I must take your eye aaaargh!! You didn\\'t let me kill you now you must payyy aaargghhh!!\". What in the world?Luckily people have a soft spot for Korean series and always overrate them for some reason, because if this was in English it would have had a 4-5 rating tops.,In general, I would say this is a very good show. I admit there are some flaws in some plots. You can still call this zombie show a good one. It covers a lot of topics. High school campus life, school bullying, society problems, politics, friendship, love, humanity. All of this elements in one show, compared with some other zombie show, this one is extraordinary.,Actors who portrayed Cheong San and Nam Ri as well as the adults were able to deliver but some were totally lacking especially the one who played On Jo.Storyline is meh. Tried to tackle a bit too much that audience would not feel much empathy towards the characters.Good zombies make up though.,Why this is just a 7.6 ?!And why all the hate on this show , in my opinion it was hell of brilliant show , a lot of thrillers , a lot of high drama , a lot of good moments.I hope they renew it for a second season.,Finnaly the zombie korean series involving high schooler is here. The plot of every episode is solid, not too slow and not too fast. The thriller chased by zombie is pump up my hearbeat.,I\\'m a huge fan of the zombies genre and this is was just horrible. It had so much potential, it could\\'ve been another Battle Royale theme but with zombies. I guess we got spoiled with Kingdom and Train to Busan. As mentioned in the other reviews, the dialogue drags and it doesn\\'t go anywhere. The kids were so annoying I was literally hoping they would all die so the series would end. The worse is when they all just stand there while watching their friends get killed or watching one of them fight off a slew of zombies. Poorly developed storylines and characters. I can\\'t believe there are 12 episodes to this disappointing mess. I stopped in the middle of 5 and I should\\'ve cut my losses after 2.,Absolutely amazing. One of the best Korean drama. It hits much harder when you come to the realization that a pandemic is already going on and we are helpless. This drama gives hope and tells what friendship means and how far one can go to take revenge. It\\'s a complete mix of thrill, horror, drama and cute romance.,Don\\'t waste your time with this. It\\'s boring and stupid. You\\'ll be frustrated by the characters actions and dialog.For example:\\r\\nSpoilers: if you\\'re alone in a science lab and you hear a rattling sound, the sensible thing would be to RUN or WALK AWAY. And not snoop in. Most definitely NOT insert your finger in a caged hamster! Seriously! How dumb was that???,Having enjoyed Squid Game, thought I would give this a go, the first scene was very violent but captivating all the same, as the storyline became clearer it became addictive viewing. Only watched 3 episodes but really enjoying this South Korean horror fest. Enjoy.,Im in a rush so ill be shortThe cinematic language of this series is all over the place. They enphazise moments with camera and script that end up being for nothing leaving a feeling of unfinishness... Also, most of the deaths are meaningless which would be nice if that was a premise, but its not. So most characters die without having their arch finished or even developed, like the girl who tried to bring food to the rooftop. The pacing of these deaths were also weird. Most of them had very little development or build up, which is normal for a secondary character, but why dies the mom go to the school just to die and then carry on with the series like nothing happened just to have Cheong-san find her in the lasts episode... like dont show me her death if there\\'s no purpose (narratively speaking). Cuz the feelings, intentions and purpose of her deaths gets thrown away for the rest of the series just to have such a superficial aspect at the end. That can be said for most of the characters.And then when a truly important character dies theres nothing to say of them, they just die and end of story, even our protagonist dies without doing anything with the antagonists and we dont even see he\\'s actual deaths... just boom: end.There\\'s also many times where I felt they left something open for developement like weird zombies or the lantern, which only purpose (of the lantern) was for the daughter of the firefighter to find it later and have 3 seconds of her crying and then tell her father\\'s partner he\\'s dead in a very anticlimactic way...On the other hand it\\'s pretty enterteining, won\\'t elaborate the cons anymore actually since i see the review section full of people who point out the strong points of this drama.Either way i enjoyed it, the tensions was a bit too much for me in the first episodes so the tone got messed up when they suddenly introduce some comic relief after the first half... Like i needed that a long time ago instead of constant running, tension and hiding. Plus they could have gone other places too, the narrative doesn\\'t even grasp that so its a pretty conscious decison, but the screen writer could have thought of exploring more other characters, backgrounds and places... perhaps the protagonists could have escaped a lot sooner cuz, for me, it got to a point where i was like ok... they\\'re trapped again... brilliant... more of the sameI insist, I enjoyed it, it was enterteining even if i just focused on the negative.PD: Sory for my horrible writting and meesy structure, im in a rush. :),**spoilers**\\r\\nthey literally killed 80% of the good characters and some of them even died a wasteful death they could\\'ve lived anyway they didn\\'t show an aftermath either they just bombed the place we don\\'t know if the main character died or the other characters died either such a waste of time in my opinion it\\'s trying to be edgy so bad it\\'s complete garbage compared to kingdom and train to busan.,If you enjoy watching Zombie stories ,definetly worth to see this show,i really enjoyed,great acting also funny moments,i do recommend it ,korean people ,you know how to do zombie stories and the best make up !,I rate this show a 10/10 because it deserve a better ranking , and its the only zombie show that i like the most.I felt really connected to the characters .I had high hopes for this show and eventually im not disapointed.,At first i assumed that this was overhyped and going to be cheesy but i was pleasantly surprised. There are enough original takes in this series to make it worthwhile. I Just felt the end was a bit rushed and then stretched (you will know what i mean). After an episode or two i was addicted to it and had to keep myself from bingewatching it till the end. Half of the characters actually think rationally during this whole ordeal even the army people. I very much enjoyed that. I also liked that it wasnt American and thus no over the top macho BS. I think the story is finished but i do see some Angles which may justify a second season. Overall definitely worth watching even if you are not a fan of asian-export products like k-pop, manga and stuff like that.,Just finished the last episode of All of Us Are Dead, and was so utterly underwhelmed that it felt like taking to IMBd to write my first and only review was the closest I\\'d come to feeling vindaction after being duped by the +7 average rating.For the people checking out the IMDb ratings, weighing whether or not to get into this show like I was, there are no spoilers, because this review is for you.Having watched Squid Game and Parasite, I was quick to buy in to the high praise, figuring I could get past a quirk or two that comes with the dubbed over English translation, in lieu of a good storyline. There were definitely quirks, but more glaring were the absurdly ridiculous plot holes, (ie. Seemingly insurmountable situations inexplicably overcome courtesy of a convenient cut scene), unrealistic/completely irrational behavior of the characters in the show (where the thought that \"no one in their right mind would do that\" takes away from the everything else), and protagonists that flat out suck to watch.Giving credit where credit is due - I did watch all 12 episodes after all; albeit, teetering on turning it off the entire time. It brings just enough to the table to keep you invested in terms of production value and SFX. I will also say, it does bring a fresh take to the zombie genre as other reviewers have mentioned.But all of the good is heavily outweighed by the crimgeworthy dialogue, the comically poor decisions of the main characters, and the lazy writing leading to jarring gaps in storyline.If you read this and decide to watch anyway, which you probably will, do yourself a favor by drastically lowering your expectations. And if after the first 11 episodes, you aren\\'t yet completely pissed off that you\\'re still watching, then the last episode will surely do the trick, (ep 12 is an infuriating turd of a conclusion that will finally confirm your suspicions that, yes, you too were also catfished by that 7.7 IMDb rating\").,Okay, first thing first, I\\'m not a fan of zombie movie or series AT ALL. But this show was still good and I was binge-watching and finished watching for 1.5days.The plot was probably nothing special, but still well-made and enough to make me addicted. The story is combined with fear, teenagers love story, family love and some hint of resemblance of Covid-19 world.,The plot and direction are great!also there is some goofs on series!I don\\'t think that it\\'s necessary to kill most of the team in their way to home!i looking for the better ending but i discouraged in episode 11.Can\\'t wait to watch the next season with better endings.,The main character is insufferable. All the characters are shallow and full of cliché.The plot is the same as most zombie movies. The only difference is that it\\'s dragging and unnecessary long.If you want something easy to forget, shalloww entertaining, this one is for you. But if you\\'re looking for a good movie, you\\'re better off choosing something else.,I\\'m annoyed I wasted so much on this one. It started okay but gotten worse by the minute. Did the writers hit a wall?It is also sexist in the way most of the girls seem to be useless except for the arrows lady.,Poor script, bad acting, repetitive, bad editing, average CGI. This is good for teens who never watched great zombie movies before like Train To Busan, Walking Dead, World War Z, 28 Days Later, 28 weeks later.,It\\'s just Fantastic from the starting till the end it keeps the audiance entertained not even a second u ll feel bore ....I\\'m waiting for season 2 .....when season one is excellent i don\\'t know how they will keep up the same excitement for season 2 bcz it\\'s not possible to make thgs even better than season 1 ....,The series starts off normally with events happening before the outbreak we get to experince the outbreak as a whole. And mainly focus on the struggle/heartship of the Korean students and their bullys this plays a huge factor all through the series. It\\'s like they were approched by Netflix with the agenda to specially focus on the bullys! We gotta squeeze that valve so people will go to ride this emotional train. We also get scenes out of the daily lifes of the students parents, which does play a huge role. You\\'re family dies in this oh no, we get hints to our current pandemic because of course which made me smile for a little to only realize that well were still in this.I did like the show in the first episodes and can say they did probably nail it pretty well with the Korean high schools. It\\'s tough, it\\'s uptight as heck like everyone has a broom up their bums and everyone is fanatic about being the best. Well if you have to study 12 hrs a day and you\\'re life seems dependent on graduation off this school seems resonable.But once they get into the explnation part, where they wanna evolve the students from prey to hunters and survialist roles it kinda falls apart. Like the whole writing and logical consistency for me. It gets rather very slow and annoying to watch.Well to start off we follow arround our main lead character which spoiler dies which is not surprising. But the show made me feel uncomfortable with this taught they\\'re students but they can do and are able to do anything reliably and with confidence. Yet they don\\'t know that they have to bash in the head to kill of a zombie? Or to properly hide at certain times. Really, like honestly. They even have nerds in the group and the series also includes in their writing that they do know about zombie fiction. We have students that know martial arts like they have been training for that ever since. But they don\\'t know that you know destroying their head is a effective way to kill them. No they bash their bodies through the entire series.It\\'s a elite high school we\\'re visiting but then how can it be that so many students die in stupid ways? Especially in the beginning on such a rapid rate. Seems illogical and unbelivable. They could have spent more budget on people then on zombie hordes. Of course all of the teachers, director, adults arround don\\'t buy into any zombie, bullying theories or even take the chances of those being the case. Right.Because why would they? You know this character is probably someone I just can\\'t take for granted at all here, either that they would just have someone walk up like that in a elitism school dressed and teaching their ways like he did. The writing just falls apart with this character and his background story doesn\\'t quite add up to me. He worked at certain labs before, we don\\'t know why this prof has the ability to create the virus we just know he\\'s dang smart af. But then he\\'s also unconspicious af to anyone even though his son gets bullied to the radical outline of sucide but instead of opting for homocide on the bullies he opt to make his strong stronger? What kind of dad does that, and of course as he falls into insanity none of his collegues notice this behaviour they act like that\\'s normal or the fact that his wife, kid are missing for what seems like weeks to the very end of the show. Kinda odd that no Dective investigated that before or that they checked his place. He can happily experimentLots of the deaths are immediate and you can tell who\\'s gonna die next it\\'s not like you don\\'t see it coming because usually it\\'s portraied or hinted at visually or by having the characters, show new traits or tell most of their relevant background story in their character only to be killed off for having those.While of course zombies are fictional, having the paranormal stuff in here is ok to keep tensions up but get\\'s rather boring quickly if the main threat zombies starts shifting into oblivion up to episode 4 they propose the main threat to the group. Only to then be exchanged for the halflings which just can\\'t die.They of course abuse this fact and we\\'re already starting to see how this will end. The halflings will be uptaken into society again as soon as the first outbreak stops only to be spreading in secrecy again next season by said halflings or be abused to create havoc or whatever you don\\'t have to a be genius to not see this plot unfolding.In the end I found the choice of locations rather boring I was intruged by certain characters but having this a series format did not help it. The whole story could have been told in a lengthy movie and still be fine. They focus a lot on unnessary details and certainly for being so smart the students sometimes still do act dumb as hay if they\\'d never read or seen any zombie fiction.For e.g. They don\\'t even make any attempts at luring until the end of the season which is dissappointing. Why so late and why is this technique nothing that they haven\\'t noticed before. It\\'s not like you would not tell that they are easily attracted to noise. They don\\'t abuse the fact that they can\\'t see very well and nobody mentions that well to kill them it be best to kill their brains. No we\\'re gonna stab, hit them so many times till they die which is glorified a lot. I mean they\\'re not killers they are students after all but then again it becomes pretty clear pretty fast they got no plan on how to kill of the zombies and are unaware, and don\\'t care at all that they have no clue about itBit disappointed that this whole series took a dive into paranormal section while intriguing at first it becomes the predominant thread and outcome for this whole show. And the only reason why you would need a second season in the first place.Next season we might get to see fast hungered killers, and other zombie types but for this season we got to see paranormal stuff like inviciblity which is just annoying to me. But that\\'s a big iffy.The show is good but lacks the evolvement, I did feel rather cool with the thought of them laying back at bits which was good but then it took ages for certain outcomes, and went way into depth into topic that needed no further explanation.It\\'s a 7/10 for me being well made and all but it\\'s defintly not a must watch. And does not take the whole zombie concept up a notch. To much smarto Tween action.,12 episodes can be shortened to 7-8 episodes without the same scenes of zombies chasing humans. It makes the series boring. I had to skip those unnecessary parts many times. I rate 4 stars out of 10.,I am wating for season 2.There are few on-screen situations more dread-inducing than watching a zombie outbreak in real time. Tracking a single infection as it grows exponentially and tears through an unwitting populace is an anxiety-riddled experience that\\'s rarely easy to watch. \"All of Us are Dead,\" the latest Netflix drama to take a stab at a widespread cataclysmic event, announces itself in its opening episode by meticulously showing the transformation of a school. In a single afternoon, the massive Hyosan High School complex is plunged into chaos after one errant bite from a science lab test animal starts an irreversible chain reaction.,For a group of high school students who actually figured out its a zombie apocalypse like train to busan from the first episode, their IQ and repeated behavior in the next episodes can make anyone with common sense cringe .Still if u like some gore, action and little humor here and there yeah give it a shot.,Great! Series! I love it! I finish this season in 2days because i excited what happen next episode\\r\\nall I can say is make season 2 even better so that the ratings and good reviews of the viewers will increase even more.,We have seen it many times before; zombies.Now the zombies in this show is one of the only things that are good. Kudos to the actors being zombies. The make up and sound effects too. Now let\\'s not get into the ridiculous backstory of how the zombies started...And the characters in this show is sometimes to god damn annoying and/stupid I wanna punch the screen. They makes the worst choice most of the time.The dialogs between characters and what happens between them seems so unrealistic it ruins the atmosphere.The females just stand in the background and scream while all the males has to handle things.There are few moments where it gets exciting, but the characters simply ruin this show.,Did not meet my expectation, I was excited for this show when I saw the trailer.But after watching thru episode 5 I gave up.The sound of bones creeking and how the body moves when they are turning into zombie is lame.Its like sadako ish.The story is boring, too much dialogue and drama.Students are not going hungry.I know some people will enjoy this but not me maybe because walking dead set the standards high.The only korean zombie series that is good is the Kingdom.,I liked this show. It was a good experience watching this and I was screaming when the zombies suddenly came. The most appreciated thing about this series was the makeup, the location and all the things that make zombies look real.,I really like zombie story and I have been watched or read a lot of them. I was really excited with this series when it was coming on netflix, so I decided to watch it as soon as possible. The first episode, I thought it would be a \\'different\\' zombie story but too bad, it doesn\\'t go like that. They missed a lot of details. The cafetaria scene was the worst scene in this series. Gyeong Su turned into a zombie because his scar was infected by zombie\\'s blood, but the other characters who fighting with zombies weren\\'t infected with zombie\\'s blood even they have some scars on their body. It just one of them, when you\\'re more, you will get some ridiculous moment that is not make sense on your logic. It\\'s still fun to watch tho, but don\\'t expect it too much 😉,Terrible story, massive plot holes, incredibly infuriatingly stupid scenes and literally no attachment to any character. I don\\'t watch zombie movies at all and I generally dislike them so I had low expectations to begin with. However, I was actually looking forward to this and was incredibly optimistic, but this has sunk below my lowered optimistic expectations because every single minute there is something to complain about. I don\\'t even care if it had a terrible plot as long as it was fun I would\\'ve been okay with it and I really tried hard to enjoy it.This is not an opinion, this is a fact because of just how much evidence there is to support what I\\'m saying.,It\\'s an amazing series it\\'s my personal favourite series\\r\\nPerfect cast, perfect storyline with hint of friendship, perfect location, perfect concept\\r\\nIt\\'s just perfect of all😍😍,I love Zombie shows but was sceptic about this one as the reviews weren\\'t impressive. I watched first episode, and it was okay , second became better and by the 3rd I was hooked. It was non stop action from there....literally non stop. I finished it in 3 days. Well done Korea as always!,The dialogue gets a lot of criticism, but as a teacher in S. K. it\\'s on par with the speak. Their interactions, barring the two psychos, is everyday here. The only criticism I have is to the episodes. Episode 11 was the perfect send off for the show - dark, mysterious and ambiguous. They pushed forward and made a twelfth which not only had a different, child like tone; where all dread, fear and the doom had been replaced by joyful wonder. The first 11 episodes took place in a 3 day run. I know that childhood conditioning is rife here and that\\'d take some time to overcome or break free from, but the 12th episode is 3 months later. These children who\\'ve experienced the darkest situations should no longer approach life like children.Let\\'s just say...if you watch till the end you can expect disappointment.,I had enjoyed a lot. Which ever zombie movie ever seen which is full of thiller and fantastic startagy which makes me appreciate for giving more rather\\r\\nI had never seen movie like this l have watched the movie 5 times again and again with full details of existing and excitement.,This show is so overhyped, everything is poorly written from the characters to the plot. Compared to other amazing Asian shows such as Squid Game, Kingdom, Alice in the Borderland, etc, it\\'s just so lackluster and stupid. A lot of things that happened in the show were so random like the pregnancy of that one student. So much potential wasted also, I was expecting the bullied Hambie to duel the Bully Hambie, and it was just so funny how Na-yeon got killed instantly, her character was so useless those few episodes she might as well have died with the teacher. It\\'s cliche and super corny, the characters almost have no chemistry with each other, and the romance feels super forced. Main character is meh. Oh well, better not raise my expectations next time.,The series has a good idea, it has a nice photograph but it fails to prolong characters like the villain of the series in addition to completely silly and dumb characters.,This web series is one of the best i had seen in my life. Entire web series is OP.You can\\'t define this in words.Web series contains lot of thrill and adventure. You can not predict that what going next in this series.Korean web serieses are killing in this industry. After Squid game this web series is also a master piece from Korea.,The series is absolutely good but are really more violence scene but it\\'s really enjoyable. The acting was perfect. The screenplay is amazing.you should definitely give a try.Have a good day:),You should just watch this Korean Drama. A good webseries with a lot of twists and interesting story lines. Above my expectations from a Korean Drama.,Masterpiece mind-blowing plz make season 2 best zombie series I dont have worlds to say mind blowing. Best zombie series in the world direction is awesome and acting is also great .,Each and every episode just hooked n booked but only the last episode of the series little bit slow n length of episode felt ,but at the conclusion I just wanna say it\\'s completely horror + thriller combo which is made must watch drama.,Please do watch this series in little dim light and both headphones sounds little hight. It is very amazing. All episode are ending in such a suspence that u have to watch the next episode at that right time right there ...... Eagerly waiting for season 2\\r\\n.......,.............\\r\\n......\\r\\n.....\\r\\n.........\\r\\nPlease do watch.,All Of Us Are Dead is mind blowing web series. It\\'s special for me as like other Korean movies and series it\\'s really close to reality with small fictional touch and it beautifully show cases every possible human reaction and thinking people can make in such place.My Review is 10 of 10 🌟\\r\\nA perfect mixture of action l, drama l, humour, love and emotion.,Enjoyable.itdtiditdtditsitsitsodtditdtixitdixitxotxtodotxitxtcotxoxotcotcotcotcotcktcotcotxitifxoxkgxotcoycoyxoyxogxogxkgxkfzufzurrxifxkgcl.xitddittdiocoyxitzirxhhclghzyeExclvbjgzufohlzudUrsohlxxhljfcogclgxkgogxitzurzitfchlkcg.,Best zombie series. Korean zombie movies are the best..... Amazing series.. not feel bored in between n very interesting... I am waiting for season 2.,Excellent camera tricks and direction and the story is awesome.Request for 2nd season.Acting of zombie is just perfect.Story and acting of non zombie character is also awesome.The bloody scene are seems original.That\\'s all.,It has everything zombies friendships romance bombing a total city as last resort all in one a fun watch don\\'t miss it. Its around 11 hours long so watch it in 2 days !,From starting to end, not a single second seemed boring, neither the ending is predictable nor the characters you will think definitely survive will survive. It\\'s gory, it\\'s emotional, it\\'s amazing. Just don\\'t believe in bad reviews, they must have bad taste. From the first episode you\\'ll see how amazing this series is and you\\'ll end up binged watching it. If you like Train To Busan, you\\'re going to love All Of Us Are Dead.,How can a human survive 3 days without food with a good health condition?And why its 12 episodes long? I am truly disappointed after watching this series.,I like the start of this show very much, it got me very hooked that I finished the first 7 episodes in one go and some of those plots are convincing and heartbreaking at the same time. While not all of the protagonists\\' actions are sensible and enjoyable to watch, they are somewhat reasonable and if anyone got pushed to a corner, it could happen to anyone, so I\\'m not judging those actions at all (at least at first). Here are some the highlights as well as some problems I find that are hard to swallow and potentially can break the audience out of the show.1. I love the plot where Lee Na Yeon intentionally poisoned Nam So Ju, although the outcome is very heartbreaking, and I really hated her character at that moment. What the teacher said later is really thought provoking, the teacher apologised to Na Yeon that it\\'s the teacher\\'s fault to let the other students corner Na Yeon. It got me thinking, if I or any other people were in her shoe, where the world was turned upside down, and the only people around you all turned against you because you said something terrible when you were desperate and scared. While she could have apologised to So Ju and that would be a great outcome, but as a teenager and when she felt she was being cornered when she didn\\'t even do anything wrong (in her view), it was understandable as people can do terrible things when they feel they are cornered. And as a teacher, as a grown up, the best way is sometimes not to stand to one side, because one side is right and the other is wrong, but to understand both sides and make sure both sides can talk it out and work on their differences. While at that moment, Na Yeon did seem to be the very eval character we just wish to get rid of, the world is never black and white, and people are not perfect and will make mistakes and say terrible things. And the later scene where Na Yeon was smiling at her classmates\\' video recording shows she does indeed have feelings toward her classmates, not \"I don\\'t care about any of you\" when she said that, and she even made the resolve to walk past all of the infected to deliver food and drinks to her classmates at last shows she has a good side as well.2. Protagonists pretty much weren\\'t affected by dehydration and hunger when they barely had anything to drink and eat somewhat feels unreal, but I suppose the show wants to focus on the human side rather than survival side.3. This show is about fast Zombies, and protagonists survived several waves of those attacks and even attempt to retrieve a cell phone in a wave of zombies is somewhat questionable. I do understand the urge to get help, but this action would be suicidal if they didn\\'t have the plot armour on them.4. The superhuman zombie mutation with consciousness setting is very annoying and show breaking, it\\'s understandable to have immunity towards it (arguably serves better plot purpose), but come on, super strength, heal automatically, never dies, they can do better than that.5. In later episodes, the show is clearly eager to get rid of more characters, as the decisions they make no longer make sense, and the death feels hollow and scripted. The father who escaped shootings with a minor scratch from soldiers with auto rifles, somehow intentionally want to sacrifice himself when he didn\\'t need to. I mean come on, if you really wanted your daughter to survive, the best thing is to be at her side as you are strongest fighter and survival expert in the group? But instead, after successfully distracted waves of zombies, and there was clearly a room for escape, he choose to fight with those zombie and somehow got bit. Now this circles back to the superhuman mutation problem, if the person can be asymptomatic after bit, surely you don\\'t just eagerly throw yourself and sacrifice yourself while you could wait it out to see if you are asymptomatic or not?6. Bad ending that wasted many opportunities laid by the previous plot.,I really enjoyed this series, some of the character arcs were really good amongst some one dimensional characters and this obviously helped. The reason for the start of the pandemic was well thought out and it gave a good start to the story. A few of the episodes probably weren\\'t necessary and filled the series out longer than it probably should have been.If you like Zombies with a small touch of humour in places then check this out and don\\'t take it too seriously, like most Zombie fodder it\\'s best to not use your brain too much.,But ...I have complained that why in every zombie series/movie main character is die at end and it is very emotional moment......................................................,Mind blowing series.this series blow my mind to their beauty their story their characters and their connection to my heart. Must watch this series.Who watched squid game definitely you should watch this series you will love it . I\\'ll again watch this series.And also i want to tell you i finished this series in 12 hour non stop.,It was ridiculous that gwi nam didn\\'t die. He never die and in finish he killed cheong-su still i can believe . Another ridiculous thing nam-ra she sometimes use Power sometimes dont use really still i cant believe.,I can\\'t begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.The show doesn\\'t fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn\\'t very famous and that\\'s good since you don\\'t associate them with other roles that much.The 12 episodes just speed by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Money heist and Squid Game. Time passed away too quickly. I got too much addicted watching the first season and I BADLY WANT SEASON 2 will more twist and turns.The most exciting , fantasy,enjoyable and thrilling episodes\\r\\n10/10 stars.,What a show! I watched it on one go. And watching my favourite scenes on daily basis. Watching youtube reaction but cant get over it. Loved Cho yi hyun and other actors performance. Overall, I just love the show waiting for season 2, hope it comes soon. Thank you team All of us are dead for giving such a wonderful show. We\\'ll support you. Great job.,Enough said.I wanted to stop at \"said\" cause that sums it up but stupid imdb wont let me...oh well...here we go...Seen every horror flick there is out there...not zombies though...they move slower than my grandma .. I mean...wheres the fun there...However,I m in 6 episodes and loving this. Be patient at first..it really builds up...and worth watching due to all other social issues it raises (bullying)Maybe I m wayyy too old(46)but really this is what bullying is like nowadays? I dont wanna send my son to school after watching this...and not because of the zombies...Enough said...give it a try.,I think the whole story was underwhelming and mediocre and some of the characters plot armour is just so crazy that sometimes it annoys you. The only redeeming quality for this series is the cinematography and some of the side characters.,The actors and crew excelled in all respects, the shooting and directing are wonderful, but what made me rate 8/10 is that some scenes were not necessary and serve the story, and the other aspect is that the music or the music effects are very weak in this work, it could have been presented in a better way as for the rest It is incredibly perfect. I do not like to see works of the type of the living dead, but I say that this work has taken this type of business to another level, and it is considered that the Korean works are very impressive recently.,One of the best zombie shows I\\'ve ever watched and I\\'ve watched a lot. Amazing from start to finish. Likeable characters awesome action scenes lots of gore. Korean tv at its best.,This is one of the best web series. In starting 1st and 2nd episode was lil boring but it makes your interest in series and after that you connect with the characters and it\\'s one of the best experience. This series was tooooo good.,Very good Filmography, No unique topic though but let me tell u dat d writer is merciless,He srsly kills any body lmao ,but good story line not boring Like it.....,All good but ending was disappointed me. And too longer Series , maximum 8 episode for this series. Not so good not so bad .One time watchable.ygyhck ufjxdjvhb dydhvkbjc.,The shows bring nothing new compared to other zombies tv shows/movies. I\\'m 4 episodes into it and it\\'s really slow, the characters are so cliches and the whole thing is boring.,This was a good zombie series ever i seen before. Egurly waiting for second season. I hope this series will release in all languages. We all waiting for tamil dubbing.,Very much disappointed from a Korean zombie series. Nothing interesting at all. Kingdom was the best zombie series till now, nothing match that level in any manner. Waste of time, if you missed it no big deal at all. If you have lots of time just watch it and Waste your precious time.,A really enjoyable thriller of a zombie outbreak in korea, most of the characters are really well written, a few plot holes, but other than that this show was worth binge watching.,-heavy on heart\\r\\n-there wasn\\'t even a single episode which didn\\'t make me cry\\r\\n-probably the first zombie movie/series where i was actually rooting for the zombies\\r\\n-heart wrenching\\r\\n-I\\'m glad that the number 01 issue shown in the series was bullying and how it destroys literally everything.9/10.,Literally, best season i\\'ve watched on Netflix. The acting, production & all the side-actors are mind blown! WHAT A SERIES!! KUDOS to the team for making this masterpiece! Willing to watch Season 2.,I like this korean series... The emotional scenes and the characters are the highlighted one.also the acting of gwi nam is truly wonderful.does chong san really died? I give hope for the return of chong san.. He is such a awesome character... I liked him. Waiting for 2nd season.,I don\\'t know what to say I\\'m speechless but this is a very amazing show love it. I love every part of it,I love the entire episodes so cool..👍\\r\\nHope in season 2 would be very scary! I\\'m excited.Great show👍👍 keep it up.,As a full grown adult i have to say that this was major flop! My spouse was also complaining how slow, how unrealistic, how stupid behvior the teenagers had and again that how slow it was. 6 episode would have been much better. Also, the zombies movements and acting was way more better than any of the teenager actors/actresses. I have feelings that positive reviews are mainly from the teenagers who happen to be Korean movies& Zombie fans.,It\\'s the first time I am going to write a review without finishing a season of a series but this deserves it! If you are a zombie fan then stop reading and start watching! It is amazing it has everything you want - lots of action, gore, likable characters and hundreds of zombies..I don\\'t want this season to finish! Well done Netflix bring more series like this!,Best zombie web series. The best part of the series was no garbage scenes were there. Like sex, romance. Pure clean movie. We can watch with family. I enjoyed this movie with my family. And completed this series in 3 days. We all loved it a great zombie movie after train to Busan.,This is actually a masterpiece.. Korea knows how to dissolve someone\\'s heart .. they provide best zombie cinematic with lots of emotions and all characters are frictional..,This movie is really good i like zombie movies only few seasons are good this season one of tham all actor all story are very good and also very decent production.,They were so calm when there is a zombie outbreak happening and some of them aren\\'t even showing fear.. I thought at first that maybe their mind just went blank because of what was happening, but as it goes on they\\'re still showing blank expressions. It\\'s really disappointing to be honest.,It was all a hype. I first saw the webtoon but i didnt bother to read it so when i learned that they will make it a series, i was excited. Welll the story isnt interesting at all. 😐 u watch these students make annoying dialogues and most of the scenes are dead or okay to be removed since they do not mean anything to the plot. I skipped a lot of dialogues because it is truly a waste of time. To be fair, the first few episodes are good but the rest is literally to make it long. Imo, they shouldve just made it into a movie.,This series is really amazing wait for 2nd season. This is one of the greatest series in netflix and also korea .I am really surprised and So many congratulations all of cast and all of us Dead,s members.,✅ Easy plot but the storyline compensates it as a whole\\r\\n✅ Gore effects\\r\\n✅ Lead roles (males) and the class president\\'s acting\\r\\n✅ Properly executed but its very predictable twists and cliché\\r\\n✅ Mind blowing scientific explanation on how it (zombies) started❌ Character build up\\r\\n❌ Slow start\\r\\n❌ Some loopholes like people are aware that they are zombies but they don\\'t know how to kill them and etcetera\\r\\n❌ Female lead roles\\' action skills\\r\\n❌ Ending can be a lot better (I think); a different cliff hanger, maybe. Why would they go back to the same place where they barely survived even if its for a good purpose?❌❌❌ Because of plot armor\\r\\nIt could\\'ve been 8, however, I find some unnecessary conversations which doesn\\'t add up to the storyline. Its just there to make the episode longer. 😅Add ons:\\r\\nI know this is a fiction however the reason why I don\\'t like the ending is because, in a fiction called Hunger Games: Catching Fire, no one would like to play the games for the 3rd quarter quell because it can mean death, again.Train to Busan and Kingdom is very, very good that\\'s why it somehow shattered my expectations specially from the trailer.I can\\'t also help but to compare it to Highschool of the Dead, it is shorter but a lot of things happened (I can let this go because I have to consider the pandemic which limits resources and locations.),Upon seeing reviews, I\\'ve watched it. There\\'s no interesting content. It has the same old zombie plot. Train to busan was a lot better compared to this.,Such a cliché plot and unlikable characters. The series doesnt offer anything new. If you have watched any other x zombie movie this one is exactly the same no taste weak plot, weal characters.,It\\'s thrilling and fun. In particular, after Kyung-soo turned into a zombie, he was able to immerse himself in the drama. My time melted gently. I was deprived of time. I\\'m sure you feel the same way.,Amazing series worth to watch its an interesting series with lot of emotions and fun i really enjoyed it. Forget about bad reviews just go for it.the actors acting is also really good i hope they will make season two of this.i know that koreans never disappoint us while making these type of contents.the visual effects are also really good......,Maybe because i\\'ve seen kingdom and sweet home, i was expecting something more. There are unnecessary scenes that contribute nothing to the plot. Added sexuaI violence scene of a minor that wasn\\'t in the original webtoon, filmed in a way that was no different from p*rnography.,I\\'m looking forward to it.And zombies are the best\\r\\nI wanna see next season drm\\r\\nThis is very nice see and fun.I want to recommend it this drama.Hahahahahaha.,Very well-paced! It was interesting to see zombies all over the school. I couldn\\'t keep my eyes off as the story unfolded.It was so much fun! Trust me.. you will love this series.,I finished watching this before giving this review. But tbh......This is a very disappointing zombie movie. I just waste my time, I should stop watching this after 3episodes.Tho the zombie\\'s makeup/effects are nice.,This was the best zombie webseries i watched untile now and i expect more. Like this .zombie scene in high school was awsome. I was imagening what would i do if was in their position.,I always loved watching korean zombie movies and very hopeful while watching this trailer. But I\\'m so disappointed with this series! I think this is the worse korean zombie I have ever seen. From storyline to the action and movement of the zombie.Don\\'t waste your time watching this series, or if you want to watch it try one or two episodes and you\\'ll know.,It is a film that has found value enough to want to write a review despite having to use a translator.Like a Korean drama, the sophisticated film technique and detail stood out.What makes this film more valuable is that it tries to deal with the problems of human society.It shows the gap between the rich and the poor among students in the school, bullying among students, and the selfishness of human beings through it.In a situation where zombies spread throughout the city, the attitudes of each person involved also show the brutality and dignity of human beings at the same time.I feel that this drama asks us a lot of philosophical questions and I want to give it a big score.Through nonstop action, the eyes are not boring, the romance between students is well expressed, and the friendship between people move us.I don\\'t give it a full score because of the boring parts in between, but I recommend this drama.,I think most bad reviews are from those new Korean drama watchers after squid game. Korean drama and films are always known to have a slow character build up. As it\\'s essential to get to know a character. Having said that yes it\\'s annoying at times with these kiddish behaviour however these are teenagers after all. Regardless I would watch Korean zombies any day. Great show and great entertainment 👌,I really think it an excellent zombie TV series. On Douban, an app in China, used to comment on movies or TV series, etc, many people said that it is not so good, even a bad zombie TV series. I totally can\\'t understand it. They think Onjo is too silly. They think the best choice for Onjo is to kill her best friend immediately after they found out that she was infected. I mean, they are just high school students, and she is Onjo\\'s best friend. When the memories between them showed in Onjo\\' mind, I can\\'t help crying. She was used to be my best friend. How could she be infected??!! I think what Onjo acted is realistic. That\\'s what a normal people would do at that situation, and not just kill her without mercy. So I am quite disappointed about the rate on Douban, just 6.3/10. However, the rate on imdb makes me realize that there are people who use their brain to watch this TV series.,I read the negative reviews and it was all like \"Zombie is the same\",\"Its just another zombie movie\",\"Too long and boring\"First of all its a series and this is better than walking dead \"for me\"\\r\\nWalking Dead is great tbh im not saying its trash or bad.Second of all its zombies what do you expect at least they added a new aspect of half zombies that has only been used 2-5 times in movies or series.The scene where Namra jumped off school was so cool\\r\\nAnd when Lee cheongsan sacrificed his life in the building.Lastly,They are mostly new actors but look at the outstounding work they\\'ve showed in the series.,This show was a major disappointment for me mostly for two reasons- annoying characters and forced plot.The characters are so fcking annoying and they lacked enough complexity. I know they are teenagers. Still the writers could have added more depth to their personality.The plot seemed extremely forced- a genius dude wanted to help his son fight against his bullies and ended up creating this zombie virus. It seems a bit abnormal for my sake. The bully surviving even after getting bitten (Though it\\'s explained that some people would turn into half-zombies after contacting the virus) also seemed extremely forced to me. It seemed like the writers did everything to save him for the final fight. I\\'ve seldom seen someone getting this much plot armour.Some other reasons for me disliking this show are- lack of a complex villain (the bully was trying to murder people for no proper reason at all), zero to no use of gun to make the zombies seem op (Cops fighting against zombies using shields was so painful to watch).,I usually love zoombie themed dramas/movies because of the intense scenes but this was just too cliche and boring. Most importantly I hated almost EVERY character! They just too stupid I cant believe most of them made it so far.,Darn this was so amazing\\r\\nIt was so thrilling!! Ofc it\\'s the same old plot about zombies attacking people and biting but what makes its really good is legit EVERYTHING -\\r\\nLike the character interaction, what all they did for survival and how they saved themselves. The series had people betraying others which made me really mad and frustrated. But it also had amazing characters who sacrificed themselves. The entire acting is amazing and i never got bored. I\\'ve been super hyped about it ever since the trailer came and after watching it didn\\'t dissapoint me!! It made me feel soo conflicted and so sad. Really good and worth the hype.,Overall it was a good drama ...... tears flew from my eyes during all sacrifices......... the survival was epic... But it had too much of blood scene...,Going into this, I had admittedly high expectations because the trailer looked so good. Those expectations didn\\'t hold up past the first episode, except for the phenomenal acting. All the characters pulled their weight and felt genuine the entire time. However, that is the only great thing about this show.The plot is infuriatingly slow paced with no character development and even less chemistry between the main cast. There are no stand out cinematic scenes, no fun fight scenes, and as the stakes stay the same the entire time, everything starts to blur together.The creators obviously tried to make statements about human nature, bullying, teenage conflict, teenage pregnancy, etc but all of those plot lines were messy and fell apart with no emotional hit on the viewer.I really wish I liked this show. It had potential, but as me and my friend watched it, the #1 overwhelming emotion we experienced was annoyance. If this show was a color it would be gray-- no seriously it\\'s like they had a gray filter over the camera constantly.I don\\'t recommend wasting your time on this. Even for a background noise show, you can find something actually entertaining and bad in a fun way, unlike this. The end makes no sense and isn\\'t fulfilling either.Thank you for reading :),I loved the way the series handles school students facing everything from nasty bullying, true friendship, love to questions about life itself. What if you and your friend are hiding from the zombies, quietly in the restroom, and your friend begins to turn into a zombie, would you kill her? Would you let her eat you, because she cannot help herself?I hope season 2 is made as well!!,Good. It is a Korean zombie film that subtly reveals the current reality of COVID-19 in Korea. The situation in Korea is shown well throughout the scene, so if you want to know about Korea, I recommend you watch this movie.,Once you get past the second episode it is absolutely amazing!! Episode one and two are too unrealistic. I understand it is just a tv show (it\\'s not real life) but the characters emotions and actions are unrealistic to the point where you don\\'t want to watch it. However, after episode one and two the show becomes absolutely amazing, addictive and enjoyable to watch. Although there are problems with the first 2 episodes I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. And I cannot wait for season 2!!!,The very less important part of this series is the forced division of roles, such as the role of parents of the main female and male characters because it ends in vain, and the role of the police which is considered to give hope, just happens, and along with the death of members per group, which seems forced, even though there is no need why in all episodes must be sacrificed.,This show is very good\\r\\nTeen age drama in me made this even better\\r\\nAn Emotional Touch Development From Esme Joe Characters Is Also Good\\r\\nAnd yah show is nothing less than a masterpiece to me\\r\\nSo go and hurry to the show\\r\\nlook at.,I can give up on my soul to watch this drama for the first time once again. This is one of the best show i have watched so far. And I really am waiting for a season 2. :((,I want to take my medicine when someone prays.Please pray for me first to the end of the day.Please forgive me\\r\\nI have nowhere to look.I want it I want it.,Great kdrama, it was nerve-wrecking, horryfying. Love the fact that no character presented as perfect and the storyline reflects many societal problems that we know but usually ignore.Overall, I recommend to watch!,This series is really great, in my opinion, this series has performed great in all the effects and scenes, even in the last two episodes, the sad scenes were made very naturally, which also attracted the viewer to the sad atmosphere of the series. The series was great in every way and made me love Korean cinema more.,Excellent series with lots of emotions mixed by koreansKoreans really know how to make a zombie flick!Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.Two episodes in and it\\'s mayhen and chaos all over the school!As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.Freaky zombie outbreak like I\\'ve never seen before (only in Train to Busan).I can\\'t wait to see how it all plays out.,It is a good web series and its story is also very nice. The way it is directed is also very good and I want to watch its season 2 And i am requesting watch this series once you will also be a fan of it.,I am one of those who read webtoon before, the original webtoon is perfect! The female protagonist isn\\'t annoying and is addictive to male like series. For some reason this turned out to be super power zombie fighting and the most unforgivable part is the fight between normal human vs mutation one. (the mutation is lost by the way lol). The dad of onjo tried to save his daughter bravely but died so wastefully. I strongly recommend reading webtoon. It is much much better. I give this 5/10 somehow I can relate this to the original one.,To be honest, the first few episodes were quite entertaining. But the dumb and annoying characters really killed the show for me. One stupid and unnecessary decision after another.The girls act mostly like some annoying, spoiled, and rude wannabe Rambos. And most boys, on the other hand, are some weak cowards without a spine or any integrity. The characters (except for a few) were so annoying to the extend that I was desperately hoping they would get killed.Trash writing and mostly trash characters. What a disappointment.,The best zombie movie i have seen. Before this my best zombie movie was world wat z. If u have time i recomand u to watch this all at once. I t will bring u horror and sadness.,Some scenes do not make sense, like the open wound on a hand being able to infect people being wiped with contaminated cloth yet when the infected blood goes into the mouth or eyes while hanging over the fighting survivors and nothing happens makes no sense. When the survivors were fighting the infected during the barricade scenes, their fingers were exposed and would have easily been bitten off. The scene with the bully not using the girl with the pink shirt as bait while coming out of the supply closet made no sense to lure the survivors and open the roof door instead of climbing the pipe like spider-man. Military fighting scenes should have used silencers on the weapons and night vision. Helicopter should not have had loud engine sound or bright spot lights because it could have used heat signature optics.The survivors should have had more improvised weapons that were deadly, like the drone scene being modified with a gun or explosive as it would have made more sense. For example, the girl survivors had long hair that could have easily been grabbed by infected. During the barricade scenes, the infected would have grabbed their long hair and dragged toward the barricade and bit their necks. The scene with the sound wave drones makes no sense that it did not affect the hambies or half human/infected mutants. The 119 father character only grabbing one gun from the police station made no sense after visiting the armory and would have gotten far more weapons.Too many plot holes occurred such as what happened to the orange vlogger, detective/other cop, and survivors at the concentration camp. The bully kid would have survived falling the fourth time since the height of the school was taller than the construction site. Plus, the bully survived getting PIERCED from the construction site height. It does not make sense the bully would be dead after falling from the construction site (about five stories) compared to the roof of the school building.,At first, it seemed boring, but it became more fun toward the second half. I watched it all in three days. It can be said to be the best zombie series. I hope season 2 comes out soon.,It was not bad, but because Chong Sung is dead, I give a low grade. But It was worth seeing again and It was fun, but It could still be better and not so sad.,I binged watch this and finished the whole series in one day because I got addicted. This movie astonished me and I really like it. Tho I wish there are somethig the writers did add such as when Naeyon apologize to them, the girl , who was filmed while nude, got revenge to Gwinam, the bully, and many more. I don\\'t understand why some people don\\'t like this series \\'cause for me it\\'s a masterpiece. I\\'m really hoping for season 2, for Cheongsang to be still alive and his endgame with On Jo , I wanna see them as couple they are cute. Yes, good actor and almost good writing for me.,Idk how people are rating this series with 8 or even 6 and above. Absolutely horrible acting by the cast and honestly the worst storyline...Makes me even more appreciative of \"The Kingdom\" series and the movie \"Train to Busan\", which were so well made with great acting/casting.Gae-no-jam.,This series is very exciting and unpredictable. The actors were well chosen and played their roles beautifully. The series had a good social critique of the state of society.,It\\'s not bad overall and has a lot of cool scenes but it get\\'s soooo cringe sometimes that I can\\'t even continue watching it. Some drama parts especially! It\\'s just so cringe. And on the other way there are a lot of bugs in the show. Like who the hell puts new fresh blankets on the roof of a random school? And their clothes and shoes are literally so fresh like they just bought it. To be honest I didn\\'t enjoy it.,This Zombie show absolutely DID NOT disappoint! From the very jump you have a scene of a boy being bullied then turns Z. From there it gets a bit slow until about the end of the 2nd episode. I\\'m glad they showed us what happened and how the Zombies came to be even though it was slower. It showed us some of the students backgrounds, who was doing what, the love interest and gave it us context to to alot of what\\'s going on and why.In one of the scenes they start to freak out once they realize there\\'s zombies at the school and one of them even mentions \".. this is just like train to Busan!\" From that moment I was in love!! Every zombie show movie Iv ever seen they act like they\\'ve never seen a zombie film and they\\'re all panicking on what to do. This one they acknowledged the zombies called them zombies and somewhat knew what to expect. There\\'s a twist in how some of the infected act which I\\'m wondering will have to be a big part in season 2. Don\\'t mind what these low rating reviews are saying it\\'s a MUST watch especially if you\\'re a zombie thriller fan! It just has a little of what everyone likes in a film. 10/10 kind cannot be changed!,Undoubtedly koreans are the best. The story contains everything. Friendship, love, humanity, thrill, adventure, fear, cruelty. What else we need. Could nt find any single flaw in this series. And also each and every scene is delightful to watch. Right from first scene its been a terrific making from koreans. We have to agree.,#AllOfUsAreDead Good Story Line Interesting Truns On Story A Diiferent Zombie Show. I Love It To Watch Again And The All Charecters In This Tv Show Is So Good. Zombie, Love, Friends, Emotional Pain Good You Have To Watch It 1 Time In Your Life.,Sooo[ooooooobad. Please dont WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I WASTED MINE. IT. IS. SO. BAD!!! Every charaxter is mega stupid. Most of the scenes were very awkward and clicheic. I think it is one of the worst tv series that i have watched in my entire life.,I was looking forward to this as I am a huge fan of Korean zombie movies. Was very disappointed watching this.If you\\'re looking for a movie with action, well thought out storyline and good character development this is not the show for you. If you are looking for a show about teenage angst and random plotlines that lead to nothing this is the show for you.I would only watch this if there was absolutely nothing else left on your list to watch.,It\\'s about 12 hrs long but never let us felt that, very engaging. The cinematography is outstanding whenever there\\'s a chasing sequence, my god it\\'s feels so good, the camera angle. The little love story is good. Hope makers will release it\\'s part 2 very soon.,It was one of the most beautiful series. We hope they\\'ll make season 2 as well. All the episodes of the series were really good. It\\'s really worth the privileges.,I was deeply impressed by the performance of South Korean zombie movie \\'Train To Busan\\' in 2016. The acting of zombie was mind-blown to me. And I was looking forward to another thrilling and breath-taking survival story. However, in this case, the performance of the zombie actors is the only saving grace of this show, the illogical plot and acting of \\'the living\\' have ruined this show entirely.There is one scene in ep2, \\'the living\\' are running away from fierce zombie hordes. They barely make it to a classroom surrounded by glass windows. You heard me right, thin layers of glass window are the only thing between \\'the living\\' and zombie hordes. And yet, they still can turn their back on horde of zombies outside the classroom, fall into an argument with one another for some meaningless, non-urgent issues that nobody cares. \\'The living\\' are acting way too calm that not even a single one of them is having an eye on the zombies pounding on their windows and doors. It feels like they are living in a parallel world, and what is happening outside has nothing to do with them. It is unreasonable and far from what I anticipated.The performance of zombie actors is respectable, I can see they are putting a lot of effort on creating a sense of terror and thrilling, but that is about it. Even the terrifying zombie cannot save the terrible plots.,Really a most horrific,most entertaining and most humoric web series that i have ever seen. All actors works are brilliant and that is the reason this web series pre production work is very good. Also post production work are superb. So, it is really a suprb interesting and horrific webseries. Thank you.,IT\\'S A FANTASTIC WEB SERIES AS I EXCEPT FROM KDRAMA ZOMBIE SERIES. THIS IS THE ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I EVER WATCH AND BEST IN ZOMBIE. I RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH BUT IT\\'S EPISODES IS TO LONG CONSIST OF 12 EPISODES.,Good action, good zombie performance, but that\\'s all. The real problem of the show is its logic, I will pick a few points to talk about but there\\'s way more. 1. The firefighter fought all the way to the arsenal in the police station, but he only took one gun? Is it really that heavy to take more? More ironically, the only gun he had was taken by a weak man, and he did not even bother to take the gun back! 2. Every time things get a little emotional, the characters had to shout even there were lots of zombies around, its like they were afraid zombies don\\'t know where they are. 3 What\\'s the point of the sacrifice of the firefighter? Could he not throw one or two sticks far to draw away the zombies and then run out fast and then lock the door from outside, I think that\\'s totally possible. 4 The girl had a wooden spike, she could have used it to kill dozens of zombies, but instead she waved it around like a normal stick, if you cant use it right, cant you give it to another man?,Thank you so much for these masterpiece. I have seen Many zombie film or series but these series is another level. I enjoyed hole day watching these masterpiece.,I must create new account to make a review for this.Again and again, why all zombie movies treat character as no-brainer ? I know that this is unreal world, but character is human, and human has brain to actually think ?What they do ? Shout out to invite zombie to come to them ? Lol, is this joke ?Let\\'s try again, to make this genre better, at least treat character as normal human , is it possible ? Or zombie genre means human is not human after all ?,Actually I love the concept that director use as a high school student becoming a zombie I love the concept Love this series\\r\\nPlease renewed the series for season 2\\r\\nThis is the request form a fan.,Binge watched it in 2 days. I love the fact that it had mutations of the virus and kept me on the edge of my seat with some of the episode\\'s cliffhangers.. I\\'m really annoyed that they didn\\'t seem to even try to find food or water even after acknowledging that lack of water would kill them. However, I love how smart some of the characters were and some of the things they came up with to get from room to room.,I fell in love with this series from the first time I saw its trailer. I liked it. South Korea is making a lot of progress in the film industry. Thank you for your good films from Iran.🇮🇷🙂❤,After getting impressed by Kingdom, I was excited to watch another zombie movie by South Korea and this time set in high school premises. I really loved it tbh.. I don\\'t know why people are giving it lower ratings. It kept me hooked to my Tv all the time... so gripping. Also the zombie action and graphic scenes are amazing n seems real. The zombie makeup is quite good. Although it was really hard to see my favourite characters die. Things you don\\'t expect happened in this series I highly recommend you guys to watch it.,I don\\'t like how some of the students are so stupid. Less action as well. I like how Koreans make good and hyper zombies but when it comes to some parts of the script? Boring.,The web series experience was very nice. It automatically connects to teenagers. All characters are revining in my mind. I was cried at last two episodes. Humbly requesting the Netflix to release season 2 as soon as possible. Please.,I just wanna say that This show is way better than other series .. I just loved it & can\\'t for another season..we need season 2 as soon as possible ....,Enjoyed the overall look, story, cinematography and actors. If you\\'re a fan of zombie movies and series that might be right for you, but there are scenes, actions and parts of the series, which are completely pointless and lengthen the series itself to an unnecessary length.This series would have been fine with four to five episodes, but these twelve make it kind of boring and losing interest within its progress. Less is more.,For me, the most interesting part of this show is how and why the virus was created.What baffles me is the utter ignorance from on how to deal with these zombies. Even the person who is behind the origin of the zombie seems somehow baffled on what to do...I mean, I think it is safe to assume that the kids who go to this high school have seen at least 1 or 2 movies / series about zombies. Especially since some of the kids refer to \\'Train to Busan\\'.Yet somehow they seem incapable to do what is necessary: smash their heads (and as such their brains) to kill them... or poke a pole through the zombie-brains. The chairs and desks have legs, right? At some point they actually have a broomstick in their hands and still the obvious move somehow escapes them.I have to admit that I have only seen two and a half episodes so maybe at some point things will turn around.Also, if you notice that someone gets bitten, don\\'t just stand around... throw that person out of the window. Don\\'t start a debate on what to do... YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, IT\\'S THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPS!Sorry for my rant, I just can\\'t see past this very annoying aspect of the series. Maybe it\\'s just and me and I haven\\'t seen enough Zombie-series/movies to make an honest judgement. But COME ON!!!Last but not least, I don\\'t know if we are supposed to feel any sympathy with the characters, but until now there\\'s just not enough background information to feel sympathy towards any of the characters. I like Bare-Su though, at least he kicks some Zombie asses! (but also fails to see the obvious \\'scramble their brains\\' soluytion).,I am binge watching this for the second time in a week. Action and drama in a very good balance. Top performances by all young actors. Many interesting sub-plots that are somehow overshadowed by the main story arc: the survival of a bunch of classmates. The concept of how the virus started is brilliant and very relevant to a 2022 take on the zombie genre. The Battle Royale loyals are going to love this.,After watching only 4 episode don\\'t think it\\'s a common zombie film. It have action , romance, thriller and what not. Eagerly waiting for season 2. If season 2 doesn\\'t release it will be a disappointing thing but this is sooo good that season 2 will be soon available.,Please someone make a zombie show where the characters aren\\'t complete idiots that stare blankly at people getting attached, that don\\'t run like new born baby giraffes and make stupid speeches. This is not a good show, they\\'re all wimps, they take risks for stupid things, they fall on the ground and just lay there for someone to pick them up. Just fight and stop pushing zombies away and why is it taking so long for the dad to get to the school?,Best series of 2022. All of the characters is very Amazing, Specialy Class President 🔥🔥🔥, Love form Pakistan to my South Korean Brothers, keep it up, & I m Now Still Waiting for the Season 2.,If you are in a zombie-infested school, survival should be your top priority but not these kids. It would be understandable if the premise of the story is that they are unaware that zombies exist but these kids have sited a famous zombie Korean movie in their script so that would not be the case. After that line, all of the scene just don\\'t make sense anymore. I mean only four people thought of protecting their bodies when going out? Even their concerns and problems are not pertaining to survival but on foolish dilemmas like going to the bathroom hygienically and ending up in a worse possible solution? Hoping it would make things lighter and funny. But honestly It just grossing me out! Who wrote that!? Thinking about food and water supplies for these kids could have been better right? Even the government\\'s concern and decision in this series just don\\'t make sense. Like really?? Maybe the writers can learn from \"Lost in Space\" or \"#Alive\".,It starts of great. Its entertaining and I like how its pragmatic about the survival of a zombie apocalypse. The characters start a bit flat, but then develops, which is pretty cool. But now I am at episode 8 and more than 8 hours of watching the show, I am TIRED of countless unnecessary cliffhangers and extention of details in many of the scenes. We don\\'t have to spend 10 minutes watching every main character talking into a camera greeting their parents and so on.And in my opinion, some details of the plot is just stupid, and it\\'s very clear that it has been made this way to make it possible to extend the season to the max. This story could have been told in 10 episodes and i feel like im wasting my time.If you decide to begin watching this show, be prepared to be annoyed.,Neeeeeeeddddd kooooo ng season 2 at BUHAYIN SI CHEONG SAN plsssa sana mag ka season 2 para mabuhay si cheong san KASE SABE NI NAM_RA THERE BACK SO ITS MEANS NA BAKA SI CHEONG SAN YON AT MAY KASAMA PA SYANG IBA.,This series show us all emotions of love hate jealousy and still focus on its main plot zombies .... 12 ep 1 hour of each I binge watched it finsh it in single go for 12 hour continous ... the character of each of mai cast connectsand other thing is that the story from the scratch give you different feel .I am eagerly waiting for season 2.,I was looking forward to it because it was the original webtoon, but I could feel the zombie costume and the actors\\' zombie acting was full of tension and fun. I often saw that part because it seems like it was directed by replacing too sensational content such as rape and peeling with school violence. I think the camera\\'s feeling and filter at that time became more immersive!!,Well I wanted to watch this drama because people seem to be really like this. It was okay for first episodes but...WHAT IS THAT? Theare very absurdly designed. I was happy when I saw some of the zombies are different from eachother. But what\\'s the point if you don\\'t use it perfectly? The group has a girl zombie/human on their side but they don\\'t use it for their good. For example, they saw the \"bully\" zombie/human can go anywhere and zombies don\\'t make something to him. Then, THEN WHY THE MEMBER OF GROUP SACRIFACE THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF GIRL ZOMBIE/HUMAN? Just tell her \"go away and make noise while we escape.\"\\r\\nAnd why the girl in the pink dress survive first in that room and eat/drink what her want, and we saw that she wanted to help and then she died soon after. Why didn\\'t you kill her when she went away with teacher?I can\\'t understand. My English is dead. Lol.,This is actually my favourite zombie show after ftwd. Even the title is interesting, that\\'s what brought me to the show and how I started watching it and with that I made othe best decision ever. I was a little sceptical at first but the first episode was when I realised how good and amazing it is. I literally love it so much, it\\'s one of my comfort shows. I cannot even put it to words how much I love that show. I mean the characters are cool asf, the story, plot, how authentic and real it look cus it has a high budget. It\\'s literally too good to be true. I\\'m really looking forward to a season 2. I really recommend this to anyone who loves apocalyptic movies/shows, k-dramas, zombies and much much more. I literally feel so sad after watching it all and I want more of the show. It\\'s that really lame feeling when you finish your favourite show and just don\\'t know what to do. No spoilers here but it truly amazed me and just everything about it is spectacular. There\\'s literally nothing bad about it. And it was such an enjoyment, I really enjoyed every second of the series and it\\'s easily my favourite show at the moment. A solid 10/10 with no doubts. Recommend it 101%!! Watch it you won\\'t regret it!!,I love the series but my annoyance kept piling up because I thought it was a Korea movie that I shouldn\\'t raise my expectations. Not until I saw squid game, with it episodes less than 10. They tried to make it as real as possible and it became a huge success...Why will a Commander commit suicide because he ordered the execution of a small town so as to contain the virus. Thus saving million.. In US such scenerio are called COLLATERAL DAMAGE.No one would persecute him for that!!!I love the K-drama because they are growing so fast and rapid but 90% of their series makes me so mad at the end. I had to stop watching Lee Min Ho because his movies are too childish and his acting too.. not talking about the good looks.I had to recommend this series to a lot of my colleagues after watching the first 6 episodes... And you guys kept disappointing me thereafter.Especially the zombie bully running around the school, he should have been eliminated.. and some scenes are just too dumb.Like Nam ra father sacrificing himself... Come on, I\\'m a fictional writer.. some sacrifice are just too stupid likewise Na Yeon mom, that\\'s the most disappointing moment ever.Tz_Chilest.,I\\'ve never seen before like this series. It\\'s amazing show. I really love this series. The friendship the bonding the teamwork and the visual effects and acting. It\\'s really appreciated.,During the 12 episodes with a total running time of over 12 hours, the heart rate displayed on the Apple Watch never dropped below 100.The level of immersion is high enough to maintain tension for a long time, and the various zombies that unfold throughout the play made the drama more interesting.I think the zombie acting was more realistic because the actors learned and practiced the zombie choreography from the choreographer for the zombie acting.I\\'m really looking forward to season 2.,RIGHT NOW I CAN\\'T CONTROL MY EMOTIONS ....No words for this series..\\r\\n..only one word masterpiece...\\r\\nEspecially i like the best scene is conversation between those friends in school roof top😭😭🔥BTW too much violence.,I think the best show i have ever saw in zombies, after the movie Train to busaan this was an epic storyline and the cast were nice.And the best part of this series was that there were two types of zombies (partially we can say that), one is good zombies like Nam-ra as and the other ones are bad zombies.And currently i am waiting for the next season to came.As per my opinion you should go for it to watch this show.,As a student, I love how the movie tries to portray real-time scenarios during a zombie apocalypse. I also appreciate the cast\\'s efforts in making this tv series. I hope that there is a Season 2.,One of the my best series love angle was superb i love it waiting for second season very good story line. First time I tried Korean series it was more than expectations and character of this series were very natural .,Nothing can beat this , it contains all things you want , chrachters are too good its awesome. In most series only some episodes are interesting but in \" all of us are dead \" all the episode are so interesting you can\\'t stop watching.,The series is really disappointing. It\\'s cliche with borderline cringy lines. It has inferior characters, with plenty of unnecessary scenes. It\\'s such a let down, considering Korean dramas are great with the zombie genre. It has cheap jokes, no good plotline, and overdramatic scenarios.,I loved it really. First of all this journal is my fav I love zombie movies,series yeah this is the second k-zombie series which I liked 1-KINGDOM\\r\\n2- ALL OF US ARE DEAD.,Japanese manga did this in 2006 it basically the same thing, the same concept and the character potrate is a tad similar to the manga. I dropped the series in the middle as it resembled the anime which is far better then the series i dont know if the series is inpired by the manga or what but i belive that its not worth the time. Its just a streached version of 24min per ep anime to the 1hr long ep of this series by making the character do the uncanny stupid things. But if you dont wanna watch the anime released in 2006 then its a nice series based on the anime.,This series is an excellent series i haven\\'t watch earlier this type of series i love this I want season 2\\r\\nNetflix if you watch the comments please\\r\\nI eagerly waiting for season 2\\r\\nI really love the gang.,It\\'s wonderful series I can\\'t wait for 2nd session. I finished this series within 12 hours I watched still a night because I can\\'t stop myself to stop watching this amazing series.,You will really like this web series .The main strong point in this series is the all character have performed their best and it will make audience strongly bond with character.please ye series ko ek baar jarur dekhiye.,Its horrible, I didn\\'t enjoy any of it except for episode 1 that\\'s the only reason im giving it 3 stars. It has bad acting for example On-jo never moves her arms its like they\\'re just there, and the shots where they talk it feels like they aren\\'t even talking to eachother. And don\\'t get me on how stupid the characters are especially the students, even though they know what zombies are and everything they never get a weapon, it never crosses their mind to be quiet and in the first classroom it never crossed their minds to block the windows. It has massive plotholes and the storyline is just bad.,If you want crippling depression this show will give it for sure. It has fantastic writing which builds suspense and has meaningful characters. I would definitely watch this show with someone as it can get really intense. It is never hard to follow and has a solid plot. I enjoyed watching this show even though it did not end like I would have wanted.,This Korean TV show just left me wanting more. In fact every episode leaves me wanting more. How do Korean movie directors manage to achieve this hangover effect. The acting is flawless with these kids. And the Zombie CGIs are top notch with gory scenes.Just like HELL BOUND, I am asking \\'When will Season 2 be released already\\'😕,Do not expect a great story as this is far from it. You could leave it as background noise but nothing more.Story and characters were very disappointing to say the least, sadly the start wasn\\'t bad, but bad story telling makes everything go south.,I literally signed up just to write this review. Some of the characters are so annoying with them being cowards and making very obviously bad decisions and also literally causing unnecessary deaths e.g someone sacrifices their life to help the group by giving them a head start from the zombies just for the group to stand there crying and not running therefore losing their advantage. Plenty of stuff like that. Nevertheless it\\'s a good watch.,Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .,This is my first and last websiries which i love most with my all time favourite character Cheong San and on jo but i lastly upset very much because se shown die in S1 so i request you sir to please bring the Cheong San in S2 although the movie is very very nice.,This series had me similar with Money Heist. Good story line, well portrayed characters and performance. Started the season with great foundation and expectations but fizzled out as the season progressed. Scenes after scenes of similar struggles didn\\'t add much to the excitement. Some characters such as the girl and her baby were unnecessary. The mother and child relationship added little to take a grip of my emotion. A better screenplay and proper editing would have shortened this series by around 3 episodes. And that would have stopped me from getting up from my couch and making coffee breaks. Yes as the season came midway I started going to restroom and making coffee without pausing. And that\\'s not a good sign!,I love u nam-ra my favrouite character in the series. The deaths was so sad please surely want the next season 2 of the series plss make it instead the all characters was so fabulous especially nam-ra I loved her acting.,Great performing and graphics!! Nice how they are being hunted by a Nemises look a like (damaged eye) from Resident evil 3!!I cant wait for season 2.,Some scenes are extraordinary awesome but they gave some superhuman type powers to some zombies which was kinda unacceptable. The ending part was way too boring and overall it is good...,I didn\\'t have any expectations.Concept has nothing new. That\\'s not a problem, a classic story can be very satisfying when executed properly. Think about Pocahontas and Avatar for example. All of Us Are Dead is a mixture of high school drama and graphic zombie gore. It would be good for kids, but the gore frames out the younger audiences. Therefore there\\'s no audience left for this bungle.Gore is used excessively, that might appeal to some audiences. If you enjoy gore and don\\'t care much about anything else, this might be for you. Acting is steady. Usually it\\'s hard to distinguish between bad acting and idiotic character. I believe the series includes plenty of both. Viewer might find depth from characters if he is keen to teen school series. There\\'s nothing more, only sweepy and sketchy moral themes. It\\'s very flat.Nothing really happens in this series. Bunch of flawless looking kids run around in few locations \"surviving\" nearly invulnerably, without any problems such as starvation. The plot seems to be as stuck as the kids in every room they happen to find. Somehow the kids always manage to escape, since the zombies change their functioning according to scene, but the plot stays stuck. There\\'s nothing wrong zombies being stupid. The problem is that the zombie\\'s wit changes dramatically depending on the scene. Sometimes they have excellent pathfinding skills, sometimes they just push straight ahead.Decisions the characters make are ridiculous. A character who is able to escape high security area and withstand and escape national special forces finds it impossible to climb a fence, that many of us have climbed in our childhood, and rather gives up and dies. That\\'s when I found this series is nearly pure excrement.With that budget, it\\'s very sad they produced such a pile of garbage. Knowing that makes it even more frustrating to watch.,While the zombie theme has been exploited many times, this show proposes a unique variation. There is a scientific explanation to the zombie outbreak, the whole movie makes perfect sense throughout the 12 episodes.,Within first 20 min a girl is stripped top less and forced to have a video taken of her by 4 boys as blackmail. Also first 2 min is a bunch of boys beating another boy and the. Throwing him from the roof. These scenes were not mentioned in parents guide and need to be made aware.,From start to finish I lived the fact that anyone could die anytime throughout the series, I heard nothing about the series and watched it all in 2 days. Please let season 2 be just as good.,Op kdrama, looking forward to season 2. I recommend kids above 10 to watch it due to the following reasons:\\r\\n1) scary, gory and a bit depressing for small kids\\r\\n2) has foul language and violence\\r\\n3) brief sexual abuse, intense bullying and nudity\\r\\nThough, it\\'s amazing and I loved it.,This series just falls into every zombie genre pitfall that there is.Inconsistent zombies? Yup, they will moan and helplessly smack at windows or turn into solid Snake and act as meat seeking torpedo\\'s that will crash through the glass like it\\'s made of paper deepening on what plot demands at the moment.If they are chasing noname redshirts they will catch and devour then almost instantly, if it\\'s main cast they will fumble around, unable to catch anybody. I suspect important characters are coated in invisible grease so they can literally slip out of every bad situation.Survivors are nearly as dumb as undead masses, despite of living in a universe where zombies are established to be part of popculture.Keeping weapons around? Nah, we don\\'t need them.Preventing possible infected from attacking after turning by tying them up or gaging them to reduce chance of being bitten? Who has time for that.Avoiding unnecessary conflicts and keepingnquiet? No need, zombies can\\'t break through anything anyways.Military or police being able to overcome zombie threat with their training and access to proper weaponry? Hell nah, 2 random students with sharpen sticks and another 2 with bows are only force capable of dispatching hordes of infected.Add to that love rectangle (?) with most obvious outcome ever, mandatory \"we found an infant during apocalypse so we must protect it at all cost even though we are on probably most important mission in humankinds history\" sidequest, extremely sluggish pace and virus randomly evolving just to create even more unnecessary conflict and we end up with this.Not terrible but could be so much better.,It is the best zombie apocalypse series I have ever seen.Every character justice their role. As a student, I can relate to the characters easily. I love bonding between them. Love, compassion, friendship, fun everything.Sound effects, VFX all are top-notch. Korean made the best movies, series no doubt.The last of this series has a great twist.Hope it\\'s session 2 coming very soon early waiting.,Im not sure why people are rating this any higher than three. Very drawn out and every character is annoying and illogical. Everyone stands around waiting for zombies to get close to them and is surprised that they die? Why are you trying to save friend, mom, whoever if they clearly are a zombie. Stupid. They react so slow to zombies that Im yelling at the screen. And why is everyone the bad guy? A highschool student murdered another because he was on welfare??? Like its laughable.,Best series with action and emotions. In this series we actually connected with all characters in the series.lot of emotional scenes\\r\\nIn series but it\\'s ok. Just need the next season as soon as possible.,Season 2.the characted of nam ra i loved her why she died in the last i want season 2. And all the cast i wanna meet i possible loved u all all of us are dead seoson2 i want plss😎😎😎😎,The movie is absolutely fantastic interms of Acting, story, drama.Every character has played a marvelous role.Hats off to the makers of the movie.Eagerly waiting for SEASON 2.,Kdrama Well, I like it, the characters are great and it was very impressive. The story of the series was realistic and I liked it. I would recommend it to people who are looking for a series with a different theme.,Too many unnecessary scenes and characters. The characters themselves discussed too much \"morality\" to the point where all of the talks became distracting and boring. Yes there are zombies and they run around but at the end of the day no one really knows what messages the series tried to deliver. It\\'s not even that entertaining (again because of all the talks and typical Korean-style drama). There is zero character development or meaningful plot development of any sort. IT IS ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING TO WATCH. SOMEBODY GOTTA TELL THE TRUTH. Sorry to the series, but Train to Busan is a tough one to beat.,I wanted to like this show, and for the first 3 episodes, I thought it was alright. The largest problem with this series is that it is just too long (like this review. Sorry.) There is about 6 hours worth of content, but there are 12 hours of screen time.Below are some of the stupid decisions and tropes that somehow manage to make the second half of this show both infuriating and boring at the same time.-The pacing is a glaring issue. There are some great action sequences, but once they finish, the characters sit in a circle and talk for several minutes about subjects that aren\\'t relevant to survival. Every few minutes characters talk about how they like each other, or college. This happens multiple times in EACH episode.For example, they find a video camera and several of the students talk into the camera to their imaginary loved ones. I could understand one person and then maybe a montage of people talking, but they literally show several people talking about things the audience has never seen on screen for way too long.-The main characters are insufferable. The female characters are poorly written, becoming either whiny and useless or unnecessarily cruel and borderline insane. The exception is the main female character, who is both whiny and useless, and also cruel to her best friend that has feelings for her for no reason.-The plot is as follows: students hide in a room. They talk about their feelings and college. They leave that room to go to another room. They talk about their feelings and college. They go to the roof (feelings and college), they go to the gymnasium (feelings and college), they end up on scaffolding in an abandoned building, and still manage to talk about their feelings and/or college. They wander from place to place, which doesn\\'t give the audience a sense of direction or purpose.-They are WELL AWARE of what zombies are/ how to kill them, as they mention Train to Busan during conversation. That doesn\\'t stop them, however, from standing around once someone has been bitten, watching them turn and then freeze when they are being attacked.-When someone in their group is bitten, there is ALWAYS someone who refuses to let the others kill them while they are turning. This leads to several unnecessary deaths, and makes it hard to root for such stupid characters. The main girl literally grabs the arm of her zombified friend after she\\'s pushed out of a window, and refuses to let go of her as she growls at her and tries to eat her.-Some people can get bitten and not fully turn into zombies, which was an interesting premise. Unfortunately, it becomes ridiculous as it gives people superpowers. Immunity from being attacked by the zombies, super strength, super hearing, the ability to jump off a 5 story building and run away. It was bizarre.-The main bully turns into a half zombie with superpowers and goes on a crusade to find the male lead because he gouged out his eye. His powers are extremely inconsistent as he fights the male lead and has trouble over powering him, but other times he throws several people across the room. He manages to find the group several times throughout the series (which become more and more predictable), and is somehow defeated each time by being pushed off of a building like a cartoon character. This happens 5 TIMES. I am not kidding. Every time he finds the group, he\\'s pushed off a roof, out a window, or off scaffolding. When he actually dies because of an explosion, he still falls down a giant shaft!-One of the girls is bitten by the bully and develops superpowers. Even though she is immune to zombie attacks and has super strength, she runs away from the zombies with the group, and stands around while people are being attacked and eaten. They get trapped in a gymnasium and build a protective cage out of nets and other items. While trying to push their way through the crowd, she huddles with the group i instead of clearing a path for them. This obviously results in someone dying.-The action scenes end with someone making a stupid decision and someone dying, or, someone sacrificing themselves. You also have the classic running and falling down multiple times per episode.-We follow the main girl\\'s dad in a sub plot as he tries to get to her. He saves several people and you root for him on his journey. He conveniently opens a locked door that was trapping them in the gymnasium at the last second. The first thing the main girl says to him is \"what took you so long?\"\\r\\nHe then dies a few minutes later because he sacrifices himself. Obviously.-There are archery athletes with bows and arrows. After shooting the zombies, they leave the arrows in them and walk away.-At the end they make their way to the survivors camp. They of course sneak out to go back to the school with no weapons to find girl with superpowers.I made an account just to review this. I was almost as angry watching this as I was watching Army of the Dead. That is saying a lot.,While I do like this netflix series, there was a mistake on episode 12 wherein Wu-Jin is alive again after he died on episode 11. But they killed him again maybe because of this mistake.,Brain-dead, that is.When they don\\'t use their heads, they get eaten.When they try to use their heads, they do it badly, and get eaten.Then they do it again.Slightly less lazy writers could have made the series a banger.The actors and everyone besides the writers did a great job.How many characters is 150?

But this one the dumb decisions can be excused because they\\'re made by kids and most of the time the kids are pretty smart for their age and experience. I\\'m only annoyed by one bad guy being too OP, would\\'ve been 9 otherwise.Got hooked after 1 episode and it\\'s interesting to see high shcool drama mixed with zombie outbreak.,Boring movie. It brings nothing new and interesting to the zombie movie genre. Foolish actions of the students who don\\'t run away from the school but lock themselves in with the zombies, really?,This is not your everyday zombie flick. The twist is a huge part of it. Acting, directing, cinematography... all top notch. The actor that plays On-jo is a star. That is all.,Two third of the first episode is just unnecesarry scene about the characters love life and some bully side story but it has absolute no impact later. After 3 episodes of just running around the school i gave up..,I could not get past ep 4.I\\'m sure this is entertaining for the people who can turn off their brain and just enjoy but Im just not one of them.Be warned, some survivers make really stupid decisions, it was painful to watch. Hard to relate or root for the characters because of that.Be warned, some survivers will make some really really stupid decision that are quite painful to witness.,Looking forward for season 2. The story goes on fast not boring at all. I enjoy it despite some part that bugged me. Some Character\\'s actions are little bit annoying ie. Screaming so loud and keep standing/staring while zombies are coming. And the bad guy got zombie blood in his mouth since beginning(in school canteen) why hes not a zombie?,Should\\'ve been 8 episodes or 10 maximum. A lot of High School drama should\\'ve been on the Editing floor.Good performances by everyone.Scene of Cheongsan and his Zombie mom stood out for me. It was very Heartbreaking.A reasonably well made coming of age teenage zombie action drama. No horror though, did not feel any scare during the whole show. It was Action.,This teenage zombie drama really is a piece of work. Usually when series are slow going i use the skip button to go 10 secs ahead in time. I did this from episode 4-12 (probably skipped 75%, and I feel like i didn\\'t miss a thing. Overall the plot was manageable to follow, however far too stretched out. It seemed like these kids were completely braindead - as mentioned by other honest reviewers - and clearly noticeable(!).(Spoilers from here)\\r\\nThere is just too much to say about these characters! This one girl decides to kill a \"Welfie\", a boy who receives welfare payments, by infecting him intentionally (She seemed like a completely normal kid, however is now a psychopath murderer)? The other kid goes carelessly around killing anyone who says something barely considered mean? There is just too much here that doesn\\'t feel thought out.I would compare this to me, 12 years of age, randomly scribbling down all my emotions and fantasies of action, chronologically, without even reading through it twice before submitting to the writers competition.,What can I say about this show that hasn\\'t already been said? Well, let me just start off by saying that all the 1 star and 10 star reviews are wrong. This show has some flaws, but absolutely not enough flaws that would make it unwatchable.\\'All of us are dead\\' has this unique blend of comedic high school zombie action that, although used before, has not been achieved at this level of live-action television before. During the first episodes of my viewing, I definitely felt the typical \"how can they stretch this out to 12 episodes\", just to be proved absolutely wrong! The first episode is by far the worst, and with this usually being a red flag, it definitely is not here. \\'All of us are dead\\' consumes the viewer, and already by episode 3 you will find yourself deeply attached to these characters, hoping none of them will die (except the bully) only to know that is not true.I believe the biggest strength to this show, is this attachment you will have towards these characters. With a massive cast of high school personalities, nearly all of them have a reason to cheer on their survival.\\'All of us are dead\\' often follows some typical tropes of zombie tv, but is filled with enough action and dialogue to make this feel fresh in its own way.If you can ignore some of the rare negative character actions, the not fully fledge out description of how the virus works, and the few repetitive scenes (such as the bully always reappearing again), then this show is a MUST WATCH for any zombie-lover.A complaint by reviewers which I found absolutely unnecessary was that some were shocked when certain characters died. One of the best things to come out of television in the past decade, was the unknownness of death brought on by shows such as \\'Game of Thrones\\'. If you can\\'t work past this inevitability of death, especially in a ZOMBIE show where one bite is the end, then why would you even start a show like this in the first place?Although I was not expecting or hoping there would be a season 2, the cliffhanger at the end makes me fairly certain there will be, and I am ok with that as long as it sustains some originality.Overall, by weighing all the negative and positives this show still maintains a solid 8 out of 10, but due to typical K-drama bashing, fake reviews, and hate due to unexpectedness, I will give this a 9/10!I am already wishing to re-watch it with a friend, just to see how and who they will form attachments too, as character attachment is needed for success!Thank you for this wonderful wonderful show, this was definitely a great way to start off 2022!,Zombie fans, All of Us are Dead does not disappoint.These aren\\'t your slow moving dumb zombies. These are your 28 days later, World War Z infected with advanced rabies type of zombies. High adrenaline, fast moving and terrifying, this show still manages to spend time developing characters and plot.I appreciate the amount of time they take for the zombie infection to spread, addressing issues of democracy while attempting to contain it.Most zombie shows have the infection spread early on and fast, then we\\'re smack dab in the zombie apocalypse.AUAD gives us the perspective of what\\'s happening inside the zone vs outside the zone, with media influence and political strategy.At the same time, this show doesn\\'t take itself too seriously. There are some funny moments, like hearted comedy, and lovable characters along with some villains. It even pokes fun of it\\'s early on, bring up Train to Busan, as they try to figure out what\\'s happening.I\\'m half way through this first season and I\\'d say it\\'s a well written show, especially for zombies.,I watched it in a single go.Its gory and fun to watch with amazing plot point.I loved how Lee Byeong Chan created the virus in order to save his son, but failed in creating a vaccine, and how it all started with a simple lab rat.,Slow, bad acting, boring, unexplained things happen and bad writing and redacting.Instead of enjoying the series, you end up with a super bad day and angry because of that.,If you don\\'t mind watching a bad drama talks between two who a horde of zombies are behind and they just need 5 seconds to escape and live but they wasted it on talking about romance while the zombies are waiting for them to finish.If you don\\'t mind a horde of zombies biting someone from the back and when they turn, there\\'s not a single bite spot or blood.If you don\\'t mind watching everyone turn to zombie in 5 seconds except for the main cast they take an entire episode.If you don\\'t mind a person who\\'s seen 100+ zombie biting humans still ask a zombie who\\'s biting someone \"hey stop it what are you doing\" then get scared when they get attacked.If you don\\'t mind watching a total of 2 IQ divided by everyone including the zombies.Then, this show is too good to be true.. for you!,All in all it\\'s got everything you could want from the Zombie genre, while still avoiding some of the more cliche tropes.The characters get pretty good towards the later half of season 1, but early on they weren\\'t all that interesting or likeable.For some reason most characters were constantly bickering, and being class A a-holes to each other for no reason. This got better quickly though, as the characters had a little time to develop.There seems to be a few inconsistencies so far, in who gets affected in what way by the virus, and why, but I expect that to be expanded upon in future seasons.,Kinda seems like they borrowed from the anime heavily and just toned down innuendo. On its own merits and typical of Korean zombie films, character development is darn good. I cared about them. Some of the slang and moments of emotion will miss the mark on American audiences. Cultural differences I suppose.I would definitely watch a 2nd season to see how things move forward. Pacing was good after the second episode. It\\'s entertaining and at times campy but I liked it.,Sometimes, I have my problems with asian (mostley japanese manga/anime) dramaturgy but I like, that the director tried to walk the line between east and west.But I want to credit the zombie actors, especially the close ups. There must be some contortionists in the cast... never saw this kind of turning. Chapeau! <3.,Bad acting .......unrealistic plot...and why on earth they never tried to search for water ? Decisions they have taken in a zombie situation have been soooo stupid...waste of time...They all are not dead coz they are Morons...,There is no story line, the crew want to keep themselves safe.. the main female character acts so baaaddddddd... But for production need applause worthy... VFX and CGI are really good.,The zombie based series!! Whether you are a fan of zombies based series or not, this is gonna get you engaged from start to end. You can\\'t leave it. Each episode is balanced in such a way that you keep on demanding for more and the series keeps you hooked with its twists and turns. Another K-drama after Squid game which deserves everything. Surprised at the rating as this series is way ahead of 7.6 or 8. Deserves 9+ ratings for sure and specially with second swaadon bound to come, a lot to expect. All the characters deserve much appreciation for the phenomenal performance.,Unfinished entanglements\\r\\nRepetitive and boring scenes\\r\\nMaybe this series is good for teenagers\\r\\nBut it is not good for adults at all because it is very artificial\\r\\nDo not waste your time.,This thing is actually pretty slow and boring until episode 3 then the pace really picks up and things start to get interesting. So if you are looking for quick action then skip to episode 3 or the middle of episode 2. I\\'m now at episode 6 and it\\'s actually pretty interesting now.,\"Don\\'t listen to the haters\" lol. There is a reason this show has mixed reviews. The story is lacking, common sense doesn\\'t exist, characters are inconsistent with their actions, zombie infection makes no sense, people zombifies based on length of their last farewell speech. It feels like the script was written to purposely annoy viewers.If you\\'re bored and have absolutely nothing to do or watch, go for it. Otherwise, you can skip this one. Go watch Squid Games. Much better than this.,The action and effects in this are pretty good and clearly they put some money into it which you then see start to disappear as the series continues. Maybe if they kept it short at 6 episodes instead of 12 they could of keep the money in the right places like hiring writers. The main premise of the story is so stupid once revealed I only kept watching to see how this not \"Train to Busan\" would crash and burn. It\\'s obvious this was made during the great zombie hype of that better movie. They even reference it in the show multiple times like a dumb nod to the fan base. We get it. They watch a zombie move and yet learned nothing from it about survival.Ok so the dumbest part is that the origin of the virus was created by a high school science teacher in response to his son being bullied. You would think \"oh is it to infect the bullies.\" No. He infects his son thinking that it will make him stronger and fight, which he shames his son for not fighting back. The school for some dumb reason just lets the bullies do whatever and it\\'s not like it\\'s established that the bullies have rich parents or parents in a position of power in the school. The school just doesn\\'t want the controversy and tells its own faculty members to just let their kids get abused and keep it silent because it will look bad for the school. How does any of that make any sense? The bullies are putting rape videos up online and the school thinks the problem is the victims complain about it because that makes the school look bad not the rape videos. South Korea must be pretty messed up if that\\'s the logic their schools take.So science daddy instead of doing the more logical and doable things, like sending his son to another school, decides he needs to create a virus to help evolve his son but oh no it just turns his son into a zombie and he attacks the bullies back but doesn\\'t infect them and daddy locks him up in his house where he manages to infect his mother who has no lines other than to be a zombie. So I guess she had no say in the whole turn her son into a zombie because he\\'s a wimp against a gang of bullies.So I\\'m not a writer but I think almost any other explanation for the virus would have been better than the whole dad is motived by his weak son to create a virus. It gets worse when the dad is caught by the police and tells them all the answers to the virus are on his laptop including alluding to the fact that the solution to a cure is on there. He doesn\\'t give them a password so I guess he just leaves all his mad scientist stuff out there on an unsecured laptop in a high school and yet he works at a school where the computers are password protected. Sure lets just ignore that one. Anyway, they get the laptop and there is nothing but stupid videos of him blabbering about nonsense like a dumb incel complaining about the current state of mankind and thus he needed to create the Chad virus so his son would become an alpha. Ugh. They don\\'t show anything that looks like scientific documents or research. The videos on the laptop only concluded that the only cure is to kill them which he couldn\\'t do to his son and wife. So why did he waste everyone\\'s time saying that the only solution was on his laptop instead of telling them there is no cure!This show has a storyline problem like that, where it builds up something like characters are going to have a redemption story arch only to punk out on it, to be edgy I guess. Mom dramatically runs to the school to save her son, they make seem like she will make it but no she gets bitten only to magically show up in time to trigger her son when he\\'s escaping. Karen spoiled girl intentionally infects a poor student because she hates the poors and then once caught the other students exile her but the dumb teacher decides that the girl is worth saving for no reason and locks her in a room with food and water and dramatically tells her to help the other students later while she is getting eaten by zombies. Spoiled girl could have opened the room at any point when she could hear that the students were in the other room but she kept quite and barred the door. She only had a moment of empathy way late in the game when she decides she\\'s going to go to the roof and help the other students with food and water only to be instantly killed by the half zombie bully in another denial of redemption. I could go on and on there are a million story lines like that.I knew it was going to get extra dumb once they had the bully, the rape victim, and the class president be the ONLY ones to come back from the dead and be half zombies. Of which they keep the bully around until the 2nd last episode to just show up many times for dramatic nonsense and fail and keep trying to kill the one guy who he has a grudge against for bashing out his eye and throwing him to the zombies because he was defending himself, oh and he defended the bullying victims once. I really thought they were going to have an epic battle with the bully vs. Rape victim but instead they made her crazy and destroy all the cellphones to try and stop her rape video from being automatically shared on social media, which wouldn\\'t stop a scheduled post from being posted. She was on the top of the building literally watching 3/4 of her school running around as zombies and she\\'s afraid they will see her rape video and judge her. THEY\\'RE ZOMBIES! It makes zero sense for her to have any motives like that. The show just needed a way to get ride of the cellphones so the kids couldn\\'t call for help. They immediately destroy one computer after facebooking what\\'s happening for one second and then yay all phones and internet get cut by the military because they have that power and over react to a prank video. There are so many better ways they could have handled the cut off of communication but they choose every dumb way possible to do it. Military has a million drones but only decides to use them to lure zombies to a spot to drop bombs. Nowhere did they even try to use them to find survivors and they tried to make it seem like some military conspiracy to be incompetent and murderous for no reason.Then the last episode ends everything in the dumbest way possible. One of the girls can easily sneak out of this heavily guarded and monitored military quarantine zone they have been in for four months now and goes up to the mountain I guess is a few feet near by and can see a small fire on the school roof from what looks like miles away, as if you could even see the light from such a small fire that distance. They decided its the half zombie school president sending a message so they decide to sneak out and go the next night. It is literally miles away through the woods and they can magically travel the distance they had a hard time navigating in the sun light on their way out of the school. Like we are really supposed to believe that they can travel all the way there and back and sneak back into the quarantine camp in one night. Then school president shows up and suggests there are more like her and just jumps off the roof like she\\'s superman even though they established the half zombies aren\\'t invincible. This show was written by zombies I\\'m done.,Love these Korean zombies series fast paced great action what not to love about it . Why better than British zombie movies . I want more. Don\\'t understand negative reviews , not to be taken to seriously delicious fun everything you want in zombie series ,prefer films myself but this one of the better series I have watched.,I finish this series in one day 😂 to be honest it\\'s very catchy and thise who dislike this zkdrama after watching 1-2 episodes imma advice you guys to take your time and give it another shot because it will be worth! Good and interesting things happen on the middle of the show not at first! You have to be patient. I can\\'t wait for season 2 already if there is gonna be one but i hope yes! I\\'m obsessed!!! 10 stars from me.,Bad acting all round. I hate it when everyone just stop and stares and wait for the person to turn to a zombie before doing anything at all.....\\r\\nNot enough passion from the characters they all seem way too relaxed...,The vibe I got from the trailer was that of a censored version of The highschool of dead anime. However, its superior in every aspects. Even though the story has a major plot hole but the background score, cinematography and stunts completely filled those voids. The sense of story telling with the aspect of time is a major win for this series. But the prospect of a thick plot and dense character study looses all its volume with a hurried ending. I would not say that its a \"must watch\" but a \"good watch\" indeed.,Irritating Characters, Slow moving storyline and Horrible Screenplay are few of the many flaws..Had the potential for a good movie but it was stretched to become a 12 Hrs of struggle.,They are staring zombies. I got bored from the long stares. They are zombies!! What are you looking? Just run! Not good enough, i am disappointed. Why 7.8? Interesting rating!,Intense and doesn\\'t let up. I had to stop a few times to take a few breaths.The perfect zombie flick, except it is 12 episode long. Koreans do indeed do zombies justice.Ignore those naysayers, just watch it. At least you\\'ll get the ride of your life.,This is a good show but it had me frustrated a couple of times. I think it has a lot of cool action and chase scenes. Su-Hyeon pulling off some martial arts moves never gets old, neither Cheong-san running through dozens of zombies. The setting is very cool. The acting, the characters being high school students and acting like one were some other strong points about it. But I couldn\\'t help but get disappointed near the last 3 episodes.Well unlike another Korean zombie flick, Train to Busan (which isn\\'t a perfect movie either), most characters do not really develop themselves. Apart from the class president making friends with others and being a nicer person (thanks to On-jo and Su-Hyeong) I didn\\'t notice any major changes. Again, there was a lot of tear-jerking moments as it is in Train to Busan, but they take too much screen time. On top of that, some of these sad scenes are focused on very insignificant/less known about characters which makes it a hundred times more boring to watch through. Nevertheless it is a decent show and I can\\'t bring myself to not like it. Seven out of ten, could have been much better without the drawn out tear-jerking.,Started pretty well, but that posh b@#*# in the pink top just ruined the whole show for me...Too bad as it seemed to be unique even if it is a zombie movie.,I haven\\'t had one of those \"just one more\" until 3am tv shows in a while.It\\'s so well done, you feel like you speak Korean -it flows seamlessly. Moments of laughter, moments of bawling. It was just great.Nothing scares me more than running zombies. Refreshing take on a virus, just great.One downer was sometimes it was a bit slow. Otherwise fantastic.,It contains many issues that Korea has. I couldn\\'t stop thinking about Sewol Ferry when kids were not saved by their own country and it broke my heart. I think the plot is great but it could have been much better with writing, acting and editing.,How can you rate one out of ten and state in your review that you only watched ten minutes?This is very well made with great acting and direction. It reminds me of the first season of Walking Dead for its edge of the seat action. Some nice twists on the whole zombie idea also. I can\\'t wait for the next season.,Was a little bit more than just your standard zombie show. Had some rather funny parts too but by the end of the series the protagonists were all so unlikeable you actually just hope the zombies eat them.,Violent sexual assault. Extreme bullying.But perhaps worse was a (presumably) real person\\'s review stating that women should be \"rightfully so\" broken in half.,Stupid, incomprehensible. Addictive. Guilty pleasure.The characters are incomprehensible , unsympathetic and weepy. The action is nice. Nonetheless i couldn\\'t stop to watch it, like a bad accident you can not look away.,This is good not a long review but i must say they should have followed the anime more accurately it would be fun ,please go and check out the high school of the dead also first and compare for yourself.,I love zombie movies and series! And I was so excited to watch all of us are dead, but unfortunately I ended up very disappointed. The very first thing that happened is they mocked Christianity, and as a Christian it doesn\\'t feel very nice, but I decided to give it another chance. I continue and it gets pretty exciting. But I started to get frustrated, the characters keep making stupid decisions, they are so slow to action, and continues to fall ALL THE TIME, even when there is no reason to fall. It\\'s okey one or two times but after a couple of times it just gets tiring. If you love zombie movies like me, you should watch it just for the sake of watching it, I meaning they did a good job and the zombies are fast and threatening, but don\\'t expect the best show of all time.,I\\'m literally wondering why everyone is willing to sacrifice instead of thinking of a better solution in a zombie apocalypse. I don\\'t usually watch K-dramas but I just wanted to see zombies walking & running all the time & stuff like that. I don\\'t wanna see dramas in thrillers. Why don\\'t the hybrid zombies, superpower men don\\'t bite the other ones so that they\\'ll all be ok?Wait, I haven\\'t seen such a thing and always wanted to see it, just loved seeing kindergarten kids in zombie forms. That part was so cute & satisfying at the same time!,This serie is clearly an adaptation of Highschool of the dead Manga series which sadly stopped. After the first couple of episodes I like it a lot, the acting is very good. Zombies are superb as you might expect from Korean Zombie genre.,I was hoping like everyone if the series is of same universe as of train to busan but it isn\\'t, this series is so dumb and cringe and just like anyother horror or zombie movie, characters instead of running away from fear runs towards it, everything looks so annoying that I couldn\\'t watch it,just horrible.,This is definitely an amazing fun flick. So many good things and the direction is good. Characters are so good with acting and body language. Nice gore and bloody zombies. Good makeup and sweetly satisfying show.,Koreans have been making some pretty decent stuff lately, biggest example squid games. Last few years they been making some great stuff. This year they already came out with 2 different shows including this one im writting about. This was pretty well done, had some flaws with it that is considered tv show mistakes. Had lots of things I remember thinking why can\\'t he do it but she can? So some flaws they did not see but other then that had decent story pretty good characters not huge development on them but still had some, id consider this show more action but was still really good and always kept my attention. Im really bad at reviews and writting in general so I hope people really looking for an awnser can understand what I was trying to say ( if not clear),One of the best zombie series out there. Don\\'t believe ,check it out. Let me tell you Zombie isn\\'t my thing. I\\'m shocked how I fell in love with the series.(I suck at reviews , hope you get wht I mean to say)The characters are so well written and so well played, one can clearly see the human behaviour and how they change according to situation.The friendship ,the way the characters stepped up sacrificing themselves for others , so selfless , so bold and so touching. Every character has it\\'s deapth ever sacrifice had it\\'s meaning , totally touched by this series , I wish you wld too.( P.s - I\\'m in love with the character Lee CheongSan , man hez the real hero ),As with all Korean shows there are things that have to be ignored if you\\'re not Korean yourself like the main characters arguing over how a junior student in the school spoke to a senior one when there are Zombies trying to break down doors and kill everyone.Moving on from that the show has very good production value and special effects are on par with anything else out there.The characters are engaging and make you feel everything from happiness to sadness and everything in between. The show keeps you invested and you can never be sure who the next person to be killed will be. The cast is very good and fully engaged in what they do every min they are on the screen which in turn keeps you engaged as well.The only criticism is that some episodes are somewhat samey and in effect become fillers. They show could be a minimum of 2 if not more episodes shorter and still have the same impact.Final verdict is that while it\\'s not by any means ambitious or life changing but in my humble opinion well worth watching.I binged it over one weekend and quite a happy camper.,Sound and act and speed of zombie like clickers in Last of us game! No Creativity.story poor and thin. Hourly creation decisions.for example why Le Cheongson\\'s mother in spite of know exactly deadly zombies go to school with no plan.part of cafeteria in high school more funny Instead horrible.human and zombies slip like Charlie Chaplin in his moveies! I think 6 is enough for this show.,After watching so many zombie movies and series, this one doesnt have anything new and exciting to offer. The characters have no depth and the scenes are predictable and not believable. All of the episodes are just endless acrobats and running around. It such a shame because some of the actors are actually good.,I\\'ve always been a great fan of zombie shows, and was totally looking forward to this! Loved Train to Busan, Kingdom and had high hopes for this.Love\\r\\nThis show has great make-up effects, a fair amount of humour, and an interesting storyline. Story was unpredictable, and had good twists and turns.Hate\\r\\nBut throughout the movie, I felt irritated so many times by the poor decisions made by the characters - like seriously questionable kinds that resulted in unnecessary sacrifices.Overall a good show, but 4 stars deducted from that., Fantastic\\r\\n, Exciting from start to finish\\r\\n, Not bad for a zombie horror series!\\r\\n, [8.5] For Nam-Ra, the cute leader who combined strength and self-control\\r\\n, WELL EXECUTED UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE SERIES.\\r\\n, A zombie series with bite\\r\\n, Classic\\r\\n, Entertaining\\r\\n, WHEN THEY SAY ALL, THEY\\'RE NOT JOKING!\\r\\n, Not bad\\r\\n, Great show...but lots of plot holes\\r\\n, OVERHYPED\\r\\n, Watch #Alive instead, it\\'s shorter and much better\\r\\n, Below average Zombie drama compared to Kingdom\\r\\n, NOT the Best, but a VERY GOOD WATCH.\\r\\n, Inducing anxiety-riddled experience to watch\\r\\n, Zombiecalypse Nightmare\\r\\n, Squelch, snarl.\\r\\n, Train to Busan...IT IS NOT!!\\r\\n, Consistency in the Chaos\\r\\n, This Is Just A Non Stop, No Sit Back And Relax, Series Of Utter Terror!\\r\\n, sacrifice and responsibility\\r\\n, Stylish, competent, repetitive, uneven and conflicting\\r\\n, A cure for bullying at Hyosan High\\r\\n, ENTERTAINING\\r\\n, Disappointing!

The Cuba parts are quite enchanting. But things slow down back in Seoul.\\r\\nThe smiles are a big feature here. Park Bo Gum smiles a lot from big out of place grins to half smiles. Song Hye Kyo seems too laid back and gives weak smiles too often. The romance has kissing but they behave more like friends than passionate lovers. In law interference from both sides rich and poor. The impact on the poor side is quite interesting for a change it is usually the other way round. Also the ex husband wanting to get her back is weak and just a plot device. The downfall of the powerful seems a contrived. She actually looked better with her ex husband.,The premisses of the story were good, as the story of the leading lady was tragic and it was obvious that when he met the young man, her life changed as well as her as a person. However, the romance and the love story all together lacked intensity. After the strong start, the events tended to repeat each other and the twists were boring. At least the performances were good, however, the two leads lacked chemistry and looked more like good friends than lovers.,Great cast and story, except when the writer falls into KDrama bad mother cliches and silly plot twists and gaffes in the last couple of eps to extend the episodes to the 16 signed for. PBG has the toughest role in creating a character who evolves from sweet but callow youth to a truly good man everyone else can learn from. I loved him so much. Also, the OST is one of the best in KDrama, and those two thematic ballads had me in tears more than once. It\\'s a good drama, but once again the flaws that do exist are in the writing toward the end, not the acting or direction. Recommended.,K-drama that running just a tad too slow and lacking punch despite promising first episode in beautiful Cuba. This time Park Shin-woo brought gender reversal of atypical lead characters with different social class to fall for each other and overcome the obstacles.Most exciting aspect was the pairing of Song Hye-kyo & Park Bo-gum. They didn\\'t disappoint fans and audience with solid sweet chemistry consider their age gap in challenging relationship. Supporting cast only gave serviceable performances to extend the show with hardly any twists.,A couple have a brief encounter whilst in Cuba and on their return to Korea they meet again as a new employee at a hotel and the owner. A gently paced romantic drama which sees the couple having to deal with their different backgrounds, a jealous ex husband and an ex mother in law from hell. A well acted drama from the entire cast and some interesting side characters makes it an enjoyable though steady watch.,With a super casting of Park and Song, the story itself is disappointingly dull.The business ability of Song is not amplely reflected in the drama. And i also hope that Park be more able and has exceptional wit to help Song on her hotel business. So he will be more musculine.All the episodes develops just on their romance. The whole drama is one dimemsional and is not rich in content. The Cuba setting can just bring excitement for the first two episodes.A foreign setting and a supersar casting is not enough to make a good drama. Especially for this drama Song is older than Park, there will not be many kisses and romantic scenes like typical love drama. I expect the writer would add something special to compensate for the age gap. Like Mr Sunshine the age gap are compensated with beautiful shooting, great war scene, amazing costume. In Boyfriend we do not see anything special worth praising.Anyway the acting of the lead couple is above standard. They are both so famous and must have some attractiveness by their own character. Thus still worth a score of 7.,7.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2018/2019 South Korean television romance drama with 16, 60 minute episodes.Cha Soo-hyun (Song Hye-kyo), has lived life in the spot light serving as a poster child for her politician father. Her mother, who sees her daughter as a pawn to further her husband\\'s political career, marries her off to a chaebol whose family has wealth and power sufficient to support her families\\' political ambitions. The loveless marriage soon falls apart when Soo-hyun\\'s husband declares he wants to marry one of the women he had been having an affair with. There are conditions to the divorce on both sides, Soo-hyun\\'s mother-in-law insists she continue to attend family gatherings until her son remarries. Soo-Hyun requests to be CEO of a hotel owned by the family which is on the verge of failing financially. Soo-Hyun makes the hotel so successful that she goes to Cuba to strike a deal to expand her hotel brand. It is while there that she has several chance encounters with Kim Jin-hyuk (Park Bo-gum), who saved doing part time jobs for a fun filled trip too Cuba before returning to South Korea and settling int his career. Soo-Hyun takes an impulsive trip out without her staff to see a highly recommended beach sunset and winds up being pick pocketed and stranded. She asks Jin-Hyuk to help her and they wind up spending a spontaneous and eventful evening together. They planned a good bye meeting the next morning but Soo-Hyun gets delayed and they return to South Korea separately thinking they are unlikely to see each other again. Fate has a say though and Jin-Hyuk\\'s new job is with Soo-hyun\\'s company. Differences in age, social class, and her ex in laws and parents desire for her to remarry her former spouse all stand in the way of the developing romance. Can the two overcome all the obstacles?Spoilers** Overall I would characterize this as boring. It wasn\\'t bad but it wasn\\'t particularly good either. The entire story line was very very predictable. When they were in Cuba it was slightly interesting as it was intriguing knowing neither one of them really knew who the other one was so there was anticipation in that. Also, in Cuba, they were doing some interesting things in that cultural space. When they were back in South Korea there was a moment of uncertainty when it turned out he worked for her and her company and when he had to go to an office farther away. The female lead character had a very \"flat\" personality. It was supposed to be due to her upbringing but, other than a few more smiles, the character did not change or grow significantly. It made it hard to understand why the magnanimous male character would be so madly in love with her. I thought that her conflict with her ex\\'s family would turn out to be a way bigger deal than it actually wound up being. The fact that her father took care of it made the entire struggle leading up to that kind of a mute point. Even their small break up was very predictable and the fact that they got back together even more predictable. If it seems like I\\'m using the word predictable a lot it\\'s very intentional there were no major surprises or twists which for me made the story very ho-hum. His mom and her actions is something you would expect within the context of a Korean drama yet I still found it very mean and irritating. I know it\\'s the American in me that finds the way parents in Korean dramas interfere in the lives of their children annoying. When it is just them disapproving and working on their own child it is one thing but when they harm someone else emotionally it is just abusive. I was disappointed he was not angry with his mom about it. The father was and I liked that. I was glad she finally came around but it was almost too late. Not one I would rewatch or recommend unless someone is a serious fan of one of the leads or just likes very predictable romantic dramas.,I had rather high expectations from this show and it turned out to be a somewhat average, formulaic love story.\\r\\nThe only thing that really sets this show apart is the fact that it switches up the male CEO falling for the poor girl/secretary trope that is very common in k-dramas. The story is pretty simple, nothing too exciting but it makes sense. The plot revolves mainly around a very angsty, cutesy romance, so if that is your thing you will probably like this. The acting was very good, the soundtrack was decent, and I will say the cinematography was very pretty and well done.\\r\\nThis was a \"noona\" romance (which I didn\\'t realize till a few episodes in), and while I normally dislike noona romances, this one didn\\'t bother me too much - Park Bo-Gum did seem younger, he is very cute and bright eyed in this so that makes him feel very young, but Song Hye-Kyo is gorgeous and doesn\\'t look her age so it worked. They did have chemistry, but not overwhelmingly so. I didn\\'t like the Cuba scenes that much as the \"foreign\" actors in k-dramas always feel so stiff and awful, and this was no exception.\\r\\nI actually kinda felt bad for the ex-husband.\\r\\nTo be honest I skipped through most of the episodes after the halfway point, I was rather bored and I could see where this was going and wasn\\'t really interested.\\r\\nOverall this was an okay watch, but wasn\\'t something I personally liked very much. I was expecting something really amazing and touching and it was just average.,That was never fully realized in this drama. I love KDrama and usually appreciate the genre \\'s storytelling ability, but for some reason this series didn\\'t live up to its promise. The lead actors are both outstanding performers, especially Park Bo Gum. In my opinion, he carried the show and his performance and that of his fictional family was the reason why I watched it to its finish. Song Hye Kyo performance was okay, but definitely could have been better. I give this drama seven stars.,This k-drama is not an american movie where there overly intimacy, telling I love you after meeting 3 days & obscenity.This drama has the obstacles of culture difference, tradition, custom, subtlety of love & interpretation of romance.Awesome leading actress & actor! Both beautiful people have such beautiful chemistry together despite their age & social standing.This drama is no different from some other dramas where the rich abuse their power! The challenges they have to face its even higher than Mount everest! The vindictive mother-in-law, even her own mother can be repulsive, an ex-husband who doesn\\'t know how to treasure what he got until someone else has it, the company employees sabotage her, she is fighting against all odds & unbelievable obstacles!This drama maybe slow, draggy or not romantic enough for some but it has all the romance. The understanding of 2 people being love is never to give up on love, show them what has been there, reliability & whatever difference they have, they can overcome together! So this drama is worth watching as it is one beautiful love story!,This is a nice show, if you\\'re expecting fast paced high drama this isn\\'t for you. If you are okay with manipulative, underhanded, revoting mothers of \"high class\", this is right up your alley. Two unlikelys fall for each other and their world turns upside down. Typical story, but nicely done.Cuba is lovely to see, I wish they were there longer at the beginning though. Korea is also beautiful and the scenery is lovely. The cheesy product placement is so forced and cringeworthy however, and it spoils it. Subtlety is so much better. It can be done properly and i wish they didn\\'t mess it up like this.A nice watch if you\\'re not into action or shows that have a mysterious plotline.,This is a nice show with an obvious Park Bo-Gum effect, it probably would have flopped in a heap without him. Needless to say though, he makes it work. A typical rich girl and poor (yet handsome) boy out of her league fall in love, held back by evil families and families who don\\'t want the drama.It is slow, very slow, but the scenery makes up for it in Cuba. The only annoyance I have with it, apart from the very obvious product placement (subtlety is key, ppl!) is that rich chick\\'s sideburns. Holy, once you see them you can\\'t not notice they must be waxed in place for eternity. (Petty I know, but it\\'s the little things!).Sideburns aside, if you don\\'t want a heavy plot line you need to think about, watch this.,The drama has a very simple plot. It is very obviously predictable with hardly any plot twists. It is very slow paced and sometimes dragged with unnecessary dialogues as well. And the drama is heavily focused on the main couple with less time for the supporting cast, which is a bad decision because the supporting cast were the lively characters that added more colour to the drama.Talking about the main leads, both the actors are my favourites. I adore and love Song Hyekyo for more than a decade and simply cannot control my face muscles and smile like an idiot whenever Park Bogum is on my screen smiling.However, I did not like their acting in this drama. While I felt the chemistry (good job director), I did not feel they each liked their characters or embodied them comfortably. Especially Song Hyekyo (I love her but I have to say it) was expressionless most of the time and I felt this was the worse acting job she has done. It was sad to see and put me off. Park Bogum tried his best with his goody-two-shoes perfect specimen of character, but he still came of a bit bland. I enjoyed his role in Hello Monster much better!The supporting cast was much better in comparison. And were actually fun to watch.HOWEVER, you will forget everything when you watch the drama because of its photographically beautiful cinematography. It\\'s a photographer\\'s heaving! The sceneries were eye soothing, delightful and magnificent!I took about a month to watch all the episodes where as usually I finish a 16 episode kdrama in four days. So, it was a boring watch for me. But, I will still recommend it to you. Your view might be different to mine. (Plus those charming views must be seen!),I am giving it 10 stars because this drama is different from other K Dramas. It is so simple and subtle that you fall in love with both characters.Park Bo Gum always do amazing work with his charm. Simplicity at its best.Also there are many negative reviews regarding this drama. But if you want to see something different then supernatural KDrama then this is it.,I adored this kdrama!!!! From the first episodes the immense charm of Park Bo Gum, the magical story and the exotic Havana, made me totally attached to this drama!!! I just couldn\\'t stop watching it!!!Loving story, full of romance, magical scenery, kindness, beautiful words and charming leads!For me, overcoming obstacles to win the love of your life, while being true to your own principles, would be the main message of this drama.Happiness followed by sorrow gave us emotional ups and downs.I cannot even express how Park Bo Gum has PERFECTLY acted on this role! I feel that whole drama was played on his face expressions alone! And... OMG!!! he was so, so, so HANDSOME, especially with his long hair!!!!! OMG!!!! So Handsome!!!!!! Love you Park Bo Gum!!!Song Hye Kyo was also great in her role of the \"cold face\" woman, living in such an oppressive environment.Excellent love story!!! I adored it!!!!,These K-dramas really know how to do romance. The cinematography is excellent...perfect advert for Korea and Cuba. Each episode gives me a tingly feeling at the top of my head. There are no coincidences just pleasant believable serendipity.,Like many of the recent Korean dramas, the story really starts off in a foreign location, Cuba. The series has wonderfully captured the charm of Havana with its beautiful cinematography and music. Park Go Bum, expert traveler and amateur photographer comes to the aide of a hotel CEO who has lived a life dictated by others up to this point. Despite her reserve, his warmth draws her in and she allows herself one evening to really live. Fade away and they are next in Seoul where she is the CEO and he is a newbie employee. The friendship continues to grow despite her desire to keep him at length. No wonder. Who can resist his smile? You can\\'t help but hope that there is a happy ending despite their differences in social class or wealth or age.,...and that\\'s enough!I have a lot to say.First, it\\'s true, that the female lead does not seem to feel anything.I came up with two explanations. First, she is portraying a broken person, someone who was taught to forget about herself and her own dreams or desires to just turn into a puppet. Habits die hard. Moreover, she is so not used to beeing happy that she doesn\\'t know how. And she\\'s afraid she\\'ll have to pay for it at some point. Finally, what woman her age could dream of keeping a Park BoGeum ? Hm?Second explanation: Most Korean actresses are bad a conveying their character\\'s feelings. I noticed that a lot. The pathos always seems to be brought by the male leads (first and second leads). It was painfully obvious, for instance, in \"Are You A Human?\", a perfect drama minus the female lead\\'s poor, pathetic acting. She was the human falling for a robot, and yet, the robot was the only one who actually seemed to feel! Those actresses behave as they should, it\\'s just that their faces seem to be carved in stone. Son Hye Jin is an exception.That brings me to watching this after seeing \"Something in the rain\", one of my favoutite dramas ever!!! Son HyeJin and Jung Hae-In? You ship them toghether right away, HuynBin or not Hyun Bin! The comparison would definitely make Encounter feel dull and akward. So I tried not to compare.Still, when a statue-like actress stands next to Park BoGum and his amazing, breath-taking, heart-crushing (I\\'ll end up inventing words here) acting skills, It doesn\\'t look good.That was the only complain. There went a star.Park BoGum. Well. Do I need to add anything? Just... even if you\\'re not gonna watch the drama, check episode 11 on 7.10. This scene will show you another side of him. Not an angel anymore is he? OMG, I keep watching this, chills... Oomph!I liked that the story was simple. Nobody looses their memory or gets murdered. There is no huge side love story to take away most of the show. It\\'s just two people falling in love and struggling to make it in a hostile and judgemental society.I loved that there were black people! Woah! So many of them! Some of them could even be seen for more than one second! One of them could even speak \"up!\". Un-believable!So far, I only saw a black person with a meaningful role in \"I am not a robot\". In Memories of the Alhambra, black people just stand there. They don\\'t speak. In \"Moon embracing the sun\", there is a black kid: a thief. In \"The case of Itaewon homicide\" a black man speaks for a fews seconds, And in \"Boys over flowers, there are two black people with a few lines...I admire that some directors dare show what might hurt korean eyes. First, black people outside Korea. Some day, who knows? Black koreans?I loved that drama. And not just because of PBG.,While I have been a longtime fan of Korean movies, especially the thriller genre, it has been less than 6 months since I started watching kdrama. With the help of the confinement I have watched a good number since then, including a few romcom or love stories which I liked. Believe it or not, this is the first time I saw either leads and it\\'s only by reading other reviews here that I learnt they are both big stars despite their age difference. Hence my review is not influenced by their reputation nor am I in a position to compare their performance with their other roles. I am rating this show simply based on my enjoyment and my expectation from a love story.Many reviewers considered the plot too simplistic and boring. That\\'s one of the main reasons I loved this show. I did not want a thriller or political intrique. I wanted to see two people falling in love and eventually falling out of love. I wanted to see their relationship grow as they talk to each other. I am not looking for plot twists unless they come from the couple themselves - fear, lack of trust, over possessiveness, pride, self-interest... so I was happy that a large part of the show is focused on the couple. Apart from the mandatory breakup, I am relieved there aren\\'t many plot twists. Everyone knows there are always at least one or two evil or well-meaning characters who will get in the way and they are here but, as far as I am concerned, they don\\'t distract from the core love story.Is the love story realistic? Of course not, in terms of a beautiful and tragic CEO\\'s chance meeting in a foreign land with a handsome but much younger man who turns out to be a future entry-level employee in her company. But in the context of a love story and a modern day fairy tale, this is not a problem.In real life, for better or for worse, the office romance between a (female) CEO and a much younger (male) employee, if that actually were to happen, would obviously be problematic and considered socially unacceptable by most. In a fairy tale drama, that makes for a good story.As a guy I at first found Park Bo-gum\\'s physical feature too feminine and his smile too cheesy and borderline creepy. However, after getting used to it, I admit his youthful, idealistic and always sunny outlook is exactly what his character is supposed to be in order for the CEO to fall in love with him. More than anything else in this drama, I find his forever optimistic and never-angry personality the most unrealistic element. Yet, because I view this as a fairy tale and the actor played this role so naturally, this does not distract from my enjoyment of this show at all.As mentioned, my enjoyment of this show comes from watching our couple\\'s relationship evolve. Truth be told, their relationship is rather simple. He fell heads over heels for her (for her beauty?) and she for his optimistic and free spirit life view, romantic character and ultimately his ability to rescue her from her self-imposed habit of sacrificing her own desire and happiness for that of others. Literally, he is her knight in shining armor and, viewed from this angle, her attraction and love for him is totally believable in my book. The actress Song Hye-kyo is classy and her portrayal of a stoic figure with tragic history is touching.This is my first 10 rating for a kdrama. Not because it is perfect, but because the actors are fabulous and they brought to life this simple love story and feel-good drama which happened to be what I am looking for at this time, without too many tedious subplots and turn twists which are common in most Kdramas.,Overall Rating deserves to be > 8.3.I was really hung up & stuck with sad ending from \"the rise of Pheonixes\" but then stumbled onto this show.Even though it had a rating of 7.2 boy I am glad took the chance and watched the show.It\\'s a feel good show. This is added to the my list of shows that are worth rewatching.,Being divorced myself, I really connected with this show. Song Hye Kyo plays the lead so well, I really felt for her throughout the season. It really depicted the struggle of a divorced woman who would still like to live her life, have a career and deal with the fallout of her marriage in a way that was completely relatable. Her meeting a younger man who intrigues her, even though she knows it shouldn\\'t and their journey was lovely to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend a watch to anyone.,This show was slow. Just their romance not everything else. I mean they would show every pause the actors take and that was annoying as hell. I expected a lot from this drama but it was a disappointment. Why? Because the women didn\\'t show any emotion even when she was with the guy. This was just the opposite of a cold male CEO. In this case it\\'s the women. Their romance was dull boring. And the first encounter was not at all realistic. I don\\'t know what it was I tired really hard to like it but I couldn\\'t. All I can say is that it\\'s not everyone\\'s cup of tea.However, there are two reasons why you should watch the show.\\r\\n1. The lead actor\\'s smile. Seriously his smile is drool worthy because it made the show. It was the only thing I looked forward to. His character\\'s personality was also good.\\r\\n2. Landscapes. The first few episodes we\\'re set in cuba and had shown beautiful landscapes. Places you would like to escape to.Other than this. I didn\\'t like the show that much. Please note. I just watched around 5 episodes. I couldn\\'t bring myself to complete the series because I am very picky and I like good plots.,Really poor drama! No chemistry. Park Bo-gum tries his best, though he relies too much on his smile, but Song Hye Kyo is just plain boring. Hard to believe that there is any real attraction. Gave up half way through. Life is too short and there are better kdramas out there.,In my opinion this is the best of the serious romantic KDranas.It beats nearest contenders \"Something In The Rain\" and \"One Spring Night\" due to its consistent pace and evenly spread key scenes that advance the relationship.Its not cutesy, but the main couple are good together.It also handles the secondary characters well.Shame there aren\\'t more like this.,This is the first #Kdrama I have seen after completion of all seven seasons of Bollywood drama #Thementalist. As no other movies & dramas are at par with #Thementalist, I was searching in all languages with English subtitles. Finally randomly I have selected #encounter, which is the first Kdrama. Initially, I wasn\\'t expecting too much expectations as like #Thementalist. Whereas this drama satisfied me in all aspects and especially my interest and expectations on Kdramas have increased to a different level. In #Encounter, I enjoyed #Songhyekyo acting very much. Because of her I have seen her all other dramas which are available in #Netflix #Fullhouse #descendantsofthesun and #Thatwinterthewindblows. Now I am waiting for her upcoming serial in #Netflix. Thanks to her entertained me in my difficult phase.Thank you\\r\\nSaravanan manavalan\\r\\nHyderabad\\r\\nIndia.,Just finished series. The scenes in Cuba were beautiful. Both lead actors are very talented just felt it was a mismatch. As a mom, it was a little cringy to see a 20 something year old with a 40 year old. I know I would be upset. And her hairstyle made her look even older. This was a series since I started it had to finish it.,This is a story of a sugar boy who meets a rich princess, and has no problems but how to find a good entertainment to seduce the princess. This movie is not about real life. It shows what Koreans live for, wealth, money, beauty, perfection.\\r\\nIn my opinion this movie has no value at all, is far distant from reality. This show should end on episode 15. This show is for loosers who dream about wealth, money, beauty, perfection.,Bo-gum is honestly the best actor I\\'ve ever seen.... his facial expressions and all the emotions he shows.. I\\'ve never seen them in anyone else\\'s face <3\\r\\nHe also shines in \"Lovein the moonlight\" so make sure you go watch it!,I was waiting for this drama for so long, that I had such high expectations for it. I loved it. But it lacked that \"oomph\" aspect from my perspective. The storyline at the beginning of the drama was beautiful, but then it was sort of repetitive and I kind of watched the last few episodes with a bit of lack of interest although I\\'m very biased towards Bo Gum that I didn\\'t have enough looking at him. It was okay for me, magical at first but then cool down but the reality of things.,I\\'m a big fan of Korean drama and whilst some are good and some I drop after a few episodes. I really love this Drama. A really good start at the beginning and you will love the 1st episode. It drags a little in the middle. But overall, a great wrap up in the end. Jin Hyuk (main male character) show\\'s really great emotion and Soo Hyun (female lead) is so beautiful. My new fav Korean actress.\\r\\nAnyway, I was smiling alot throughout the series and was always excited when it would be out. Cried a few buckets on the last 2 episodes. But also smiled alot. Go ahead and enjoy the series :),This was my second Kdrama - but the first I watched right through I(at 16x70 minute episodes its not too long!) I found the two leads likeable and believable and their growing relationship handled with a convincing blend of awkwardness and comedy. All the characters seemed very grounded (apart from the wicked mother-in-law) and there were no irritating over-acting stereotypes padding out the plot.The script makes repeated and extensive use of flashbacks as the two lovers reflect on what has happened / what people have said, often referencing scenes from much earlier in the story, reflecting a very strong sense of structure. The premise is good - that\\'s what hooked me to start watching - but the writer doesn\\'t fully get to grips with it (eg the fact she would have turned 40 late in the story - he\\'s 30 by then - is ignored even though their age difference is a big deal for everyone else). Supporting cast storylines - the spiky personal secretary/friend and the ex-husband especially - start of well (and have good actors inhabiting them) but then stall by about episode 8 - possibly because the ex-husband is becoming a surprisingly sympathetic character and the writer didn\\'t want to genuinely challenge Park Bo Gum role as the love interest.It\\'s a fascinating insight into Korean culture. As noted by others, the romance, while beautifully shot, is passionless to the western viewer - they probably kiss 5 or 6 times but never with urgency or sexual desire. As its winter most of the time, the lovers are usually in sweaters, jackets and coats; given the photogenic nature of the two leads its striking that we never see any flesh other than neck, wrists and ankles. The power wielded by mothers (and the archetypal villainess mother-in-law) is disturbing, and the codified respect given to those \\'above you\\' in business or society is dramatically displayed.Song Hye Kyo is gorgeous - the age difference between her and Park\\'s character is not very obvious - but as she is now 40 in real life, it will be interesting to see how her career continues and what Korean tv can offer her. I suspect she is capable of a lot more challenging work than what she will be scripted to do.,I didn\\'t manage to finish the series. I stopped at the 5th episode. The leading guy is cute; perhaps too cute for a guy. The leading lady is too expressionless and cold. She makes one wonder why would someone fall for her. All in all, a rather boring romance.,I thought that the acting in this show from all the characters was amazing.\\r\\nThe story really pulls you in and keeps you engaged, it was just magic.\\r\\nI really enjoyed watching this.,Just like my headline shows, the acting of the both lead actors......the whole cast is flawless in this drama. Song Hye Kyo showed everyone again that even a simple storyline like this which is one dimensional, can be beautiful to watch. She found a good comrade in Park Bo Gum. They killed almost their every scene together(which is mostly the whole drama btw).\\r\\nThe emotional scenes towards the end is the highlight of this drama. Every time Hye Kyo had tears in her eyes, she made me cry(and i never cry watching dramas btw). She is the most beautiful crier I have ever seen in dramas.\\r\\nPark Bo Gum played the role of a handsome man in his late twenties who is more mature than his peers of the same age. In the beginning one of his friends said that he had never seen him get angry or fight anyone. So I was waiting patiently, episode by episode just to see him get angry at anyone once. But it really never happened.\\r\\nThe story doesn\\'t have many shades. It flows in only one direction. But the dialogues.............. man they are amazing. This drama has some great poetic lines.\\r\\nSo the summary of this nonsensical review is that Flawless acting and Poetic Dialogues can turn an ordinary story into an extraordinary drama.,\"If the sea\\'s job is to make waves, mine is to thin of you\" (translated from a Korean poem).Park Bo Gum said this \"I like to act in shows that have meaning, and make people laugh and cry. This explains why he chose to act in Encounter, in addition to the passionate, free-spirited and optimistic character of Kim Jin-Hyeok which he\\'s drawn to.I am watching this drama a second time because a year ago when I watched it, I was a Song Hye Kyo fan more than a PBG fan. Now I heart PBG as I\\'ve come to appreciate his acting talent. This time, I pay closer attention to the dialogue, and I feel like I\\'m receiving a richer experience, and able to empathise deeper with the characters. (His other great work includes \"Reply 1988\", \"Hello Monster\", \"Love in The Moonlight\" and the most recent \"Record of Youth\").The plot revolves mainly around 2 protagonists - the young Kim Jin Hyeok in his 20s smitten by the older Cha Soo-Hyun in her mid 30s. KJH is just beginning his career in the hospitality industry while CSH is the CEO of the Donghwa hotel chain and a well-known business woman in high society. The 1st episode is set in romantic Cuba where they first meet, and there is instant chemistry between them. When they are back in Korea, harsh reality sets in as we witness how the couple fight against the social norms of a judgmental and gossipy society like Korea. For audience who come from more liberated countries, you have to understand that Korea is very traditional in terms of background compatibility and filial piety where children of ambitious and rich families are obligated to marry for alliance reasons.KJH is like a breathe of fresh air to CSH\\'s stifled, lonely and routine life. His courage to save her from humiliation in turn gives her courage to want to protect him and live her own life, breaking the shackles of her evil ex-mother inlaw. KJH also has his own share of issues to grapple with as he\\'s suddenly thrown into limelight and labelled as the pretty boy chasing a rich and lonely older woman for materialistic reasons.The focus of the plot is on the romance between the two characters in a corporate environment, where CSH stands to lose her hotel if she is not shrewd or careful as she continues to pursue her love. The sub-plot of the supporting characters are interesting to watch too. And I heart CSH\\'s uncle driver who always finds ways to allow CSH and KJH to spend private time together. He\\'s like an accidental cupid. There isn\\'t a lot of exciting corporate scenes.Acting wise, I feel Song Hye Kyo lacks emotions. She smiles weakly, cries easily and while some of her scenes touch me (the restaurant scene where she is holding KJH\\'s camera to take a photo of KJH, and she suddenly weeps behind it because she can hide her sadness behind the camera - my heart cannot!), overall I think she has done better in other drama series. Maybe this is CSH\\'s character - elegant, witty, and mature so she can\\'t afford to have too much facial expressions? Park Bo Gum, on the other hand is able to emote his character and I find myself rooting for him and feeling sad with him. Even before I was his fan, his acting already affected me. What more now?!So should you watch this drama in light of the mixed reviews? I\\'d say you give your time to at least 2 episodes and then assess. This drama will test if you are a logical and critical audience or if you would just get pass that and focus on \"following your heart\". It\\'s a show where you would want to watch alone in a safe space because when you are immersed, you will have all sorts of silly expressions - laugh and cry - alongside the characters. It may convert a realist into a romantic, the conventional to unconventional, and trigger the emotional side of you which you thought you have lost touch with. If you are willing to be an open and vulnerable audience, I am sure you would enjoy every moment of the drama.Now I understand what PBG and SHK chose to act in this show.,One of the best heart fluttering drama i\\'ve ever seen. Plz try this . you wont regreat,This movie is like a beautiful poem\\r\\nAmazing actors, BGM, cinematography.Felt watched a organic creation\\r\\nKudos to the makers.,I\\'m truly in love with this drama. Every characters of this drama are just beautifully done their best. And again I\\'m in love with Bo gum. He\\'s just a gem..,I really love the show. The story was charming and beautiful. All actors were great main cast and supporting cast. I enjoy it a lot. It was very calm and more realistic drama. I will recommend this drama.,Every thing is on point. Characters play their roles so well you fall in love right from the start. Loved the OST (esp Take Me On), the timing of the soundtracks makes this series touching.,This show is just beautiful whether we talk about the romantic scenes or the sound tracks.this show is just awesome.but I don\\'t understand why this drama got so low raiting on imdb?,I\\'ve been watching again and again. The drama makes me so happy, warm. Although I cried a lot when I was watching it, I like it a lot! Don\\'t know how to describe exactly but so amazing!,This show is extremely well written and acted. When I watch the scenes between the 2 leads, it makes me smile ear to ear because it\\'s so heartwarming. The way the 2 leads flirt and joke with each other is very cute and endearing. The supporting actors have their own interesting sub-plots and are great also. When I saw Park Bo Gum in \"Itaewon Class\", I thought he was just a pretty face but boy was I wrong, he is an excellent actor. He is very natural, and does a great job expressing the emotions of his character. I love all his facial expressions. It\\'s just so fun to watch. I love his carefree character in the drama, so charming, witty, kind, sensitive and selfless. It\\'s a kind of character that you don\\'t see much in dramas.,Encounter was the last drama Song Hye Kyo did before her hiatus for over two years. Since she is coming back with a new drama project, I decided to rewatch Encounter to mark her comeback.Its story revolves around Cha Soo-Hyun (Song Hye Kyo), a daughter of a politician father and an ex-daughter-in-law of a powerful family. She met Kim Jin-Hyeok (Park Bo-Gum) in an unexpected encounter during her trip to Cuba. They met again as CEO and employee in South Korea.This drama is one of those fairytales dramas most people grow up watching - the princess and the pauper. The good thing about it is that the production team embraces its concept. It is evident in the animated fairytale short intro of every episode. There are plenty of aesthetic shots in the drama that gives viewers a more romantic and fairytale feel. To tweak a cliche romance drama, Yoo Young-A, the writer, decided to make the female lead the CEO and have the opposite main character do the cute antics. In the past, it was always the other way around. Song Hye Kyo has her little share of acting cute, though. Of course, the never-ending battle-for-the-CEO-sit is still there, but at least it didn\\'t involve any villain-plotting-to-murder-the main lead plot. The drama has an overall sad tone, but the supporting characters lighten up the mood.Cha Soo-Hyun is the typical CEO character. Confident, poise, with a sad backstory. We always get to see her cry, worry, and occasionally smile. She only got upset once or twice, and it lasted for a minute. It would have been better if we saw more emotions from her. Also, it would have been a good buildup if we saw her character struggle in fighting her feelings a bit more. The impact when she would finally let go and give in to her feelings would have been immense. The drama undermined her character when she turned to male characters twice for advice about what she should do regarding hotel concerns. We don\\'t see male characters doing that. They contemplate and make decisions on their own. Cha Soo-Hyun is supposed to be confident, and she has been running the hotel for years. Heck, she even upgraded the hotel\\'s status from a three-star to a five-star hotel. For sure, she would know how to deal with those concerns. Song Hye Kyo\\'s performance as Cha Soo-Hyun is satisfactory but not consistent. It was cringy watching her act worried in some of the scenes, but she\\'s good other than that.The male lead Kim Jin-Hyeok is the perfect boyfriend. Good looking, overly kind, family-oriented, thoughtful, and sweet. He\\'s flawless, which is disappointing. It wouldn\\'t hurt to give him one weakness for a little realistic characterization. On the other hand, Park Bo-Gum did an exceptional job as Kim Jin-Hyeok. He gave life to his role and owned it. His cute antics and sweet smiles would reach you, but the cheesy lines would get you too.If fairytale-like romance is your cup of tea, for sure, you\\'ll enjoy Encounter. Overall, it\\'s a decent drama for hopeless romantics, but not for realists.,One of the best Kdramas I have seen so far. Loved Song Hye Kyo in Descendants of the Sun, and here she also shined with her talent to bring to the screen the best not only of herself but also of her partners . She is really a great actress.\\r\\nThis drama is a masterpiece. It is modern and still succeeds to bring to life traditional Korean values which seem in their rightful place. It is so rare in dramas to see so matured and complex characters, portrayed so finely that you can feel them even through the screen. It is also rare in dramas characters to go beyond simple, first-signal reactions and fast-processed, cliche-ed insights - nothing of the sort here. In a world, where love and kindness are considered weak and simple, they show us how to turn the defeat into victory with the power of love.\\r\\nAll kinds of love thrive here - not only romantic, which the drama more satisfying for me. Love that strengthens the ties between people and does not destroy them, love that is worth fighting for, love that can bring you back to life - I wish everyone of us could be so wise and strong to build such a love in their life. Because all characters here did just that - made the effort and built their lives on love. Here love was the power of life and this film sets an exemplary model to follow in our lives too. Even the worst betrayals, when seen through loving eyes, are worth forgiving - and what a great prize comes at the end!\\r\\nHighly recommended!,The first drama that I want to write the review and maybe will be the only drama that I want to write the review. Even maybe too late but still it\\'s better than nothing.\\r\\nGood story\\r\\nBest acting of the actor make the best chemistry ever that make it feel like a real life.\\r\\nSimple slow and calm story but really deep means\\r\\nSo amazing 💯👏👏👏👏👏\\r\\nMake me want to watch it over and over and until now I\\'ve watch it more than 2 times minimum 3 times and I think I will still want watch it for the next 50 years.\\r\\nPark bo-gum Song Hye Kyo best chemistry ever.\\r\\nHe has a million dollar warm smile that could steal everyone\\'s heart.\\r\\n#blossomentertainment #encounter #parkbogum #songhyekyo,Im truly touched watching Encounter. Park Bo Gum! His eyes speak, he reflects his emotion so perfectly with facial expression and i liked the way he talks! He is a complete actor! Cinematography, music, dialogues, script, direction all were more than perfect! Loved it.,Beautiful movie, excellent acting skills from both SHK and PBG. The love story is so gentle, heart-warming and makes you feel so much in love. Their on-screen chemistry is wonderful and amazing to watch!,The story is very simple but it keeps you engaged. The story develops slowly. If you are not that much a fan of slow paced drama then it\\'s not for you. The dialogues, the soundtracks are just so perfect. This drama is beautiful in its own way. With a simple plot and outstanding acting from the actors it touches your heart. To be honest I found myself smiling while watching the drama. The hurdles are simple yet realistic. The only way it lacks to me is, I wanted to watch the growth of relationships of side characters as well. To me it was one of the dramas that livened up my days.,Couldn\\'t have been better. It start with an amazing first episode laying the perfect groundwork for the rest of the show to go on. It becomes a bit slow later on but in my opinion, it worked for the show this time. It makes the scenes more important and conveys the feelings better. The casting was great.,If u like to see a Man as a rabit and a woman as a paper towel see this show\\r\\nDisgusting relation,The plot is loose. But sound tracks are awesome and placed at perfect moments. Perfect series to let the time flow.Song Hye Kyo is the best <3,This is first time i see korean drama...\\r\\nStory, plot, detail, soundtrack, its so amazing!!\\r\\n&Maybe, just this my korean drama...\\r\\nBest romance film in my life...Uh, I dont know...\\r\\nThis film, make me feel falling in love again...,The story is so simple. And could happen. The man is very love the woman and so kind. Didn\\'t have a bad intentions. The woman also so love, but think to much. But the the reality. PBG so handsome. Song Hye Kyo so pretty. She look older than PBG as a story need. Make love her from now. I love U Full SHK. 😍,As the two actors both the top ones in Korea they really show the excellent skills as if fall in love with them ......, Draggy but soothing - rather weak romance\\r\\n, Not Good Enough\\r\\n, Enjoyable KDrama\\r\\n, A tad too slow and lacking punch but still watchable\\r\\n, Shall we meet again ?\\r\\n, A bit boring\\r\\n, A very predictable and uncompelling plot\\r\\n, Average Love Story\\r\\n, This Series Had Great Potential...\\r\\n, Beautiful love story\\r\\n, Nice.

There\\'s something about the way he uses his eyes that allows few words to be spoken yet the intensity of his emotions can be felt.Kim Tae-ri does well too, but needs to tone down her theatrical gestures and speaking. She\\'ll need to remember that in a smaller screen, theatrical movements and delivery of lines can be off-putting and jarring.Story is refreshing. Can\\'t wait for the upcoming episodes!,What else do u need to watch a drama !? This series a full package of everything u want!! And the cinematography of this series is extra plus point which make me hooked up with this series!! The starting of this drama was in a unusual way which was interesting to draw our attention..then the plot was totally like boom... this is what u were waiting for to watch!!Beck Yi Jin\\'s struggles between dropping dream and choosing responsibility and Na Hee Do\\'s determination for her game and the friendship of 5 struggling students in their early 20 nothing could be more better than this amazing plot !! After a long time Netflix brought us something worthy of watchingEnjoy watching 25/21.,Only four episodes have been released yet and I\\'m already in love with all of the characters! The story is so inspiring and wholesome. The leads have amazing chemistry. Na Hee Do is definitely a memorable character and reminds me so much of Doek Sun from reply 1988! If you\\'re looking for a K- drama with a similar vibe to Reply 1988, this is it.,It\\'s only been one episode for me but it\\'s brilliantly written and performed..excellent balance of humor and emotion. All about persistence in recovering dreams in the midst of a financial crisis.,A mind refreshing start of Twenty Five Twenty One!! Really enjoying till now !! Students at their early twenties dealing with theirs family problems and also The IMF crisis how affect their lives showing in this drama!!Cast :\\r\\nNam Jo Hyuk and Lee TaeRi the perfect cast ever I\\'ve seen as far now !! They both are playing their role so smoothly that it seems like we are really living in 1998 ! Na Hee Do\\'s dedication towards her\\r\\nsports is really ambitious.Hope it will continue being this good and make us feel more refreshed <3.,2 episodes released so far great start, nam noo Hyuk acting skills are on a another level, without a doubt this is gonna be one of the best kdramas of 2022 so far.,I loved the concept of this one , every character is crafted beautifully . But the only problem is unnecessary yelling by the main character Na hee do , she can\\'t just keep calm . I had a severe headache after watching 2 episodes , you never know when she starts yelling at the top of her lungs . So im gonna watch it on mute from now on . Still the story is a must watch . Story line is intriguing. You gotta have to watch and wait for next episode to see what happens next to these characters and how their love story unfolds .,Loving this series so far, the story, cast, editing, sound... its definitely worth watching. Joohyuk is a gem, he only gets better with each project and Im sure he will be making good for years to come. Taeri is a bit too much here, always screaming but I just figured its part of the portrayal. I have never been annoyed by a hairstyle, does it really have to be like that? I feel like combing or cutting it every time she\\'s in the scene.I love the story and the message its conveying, the hardships, determination, being understanding to others in their lowest days. This is not a silly, rom-com piece, its a drama with just the right balance of fun acts. Overall its definitely something you should watch.,Different but very warm drama. Between the hyper girl and cool guy, comes the unique \\'90s vibes as well as the beautiful cinematography, coloring, and music to give us a great viewing experience. I hope it continues like this and I really expect that..,Both main lead are quite Amazing, Both have descent and shy relationship and the way Nam joo hyuk is sensitive and Care a lot for his circle was amazing.Second leads are also quite hilarious and Internally sad like other teen-ager are.Overall quite unique and Smooth Series. Appreciable!!!,This is a rare drama that comes up with well written storyline, beautiful cinematography (can we call it as an art? The details just wow!), I can invest in all the characters individually and also bond shown in this drama. Thank you for all of them behind this drama, for not focusing in the main lead, but gives everyone depth development. All emotions are so real and relatable. This drama just keeps on getting better and better in each episode.,Amazing!!!! CANT wait for the next episodes. It has romance,motivation,friendship,funny scenes and it is set in the 90\\'s..what else could u possibly ask for??Koreans did it again❕❕,For some reason ..whenever I watch a new episode of Twenty Five Twenty One..I find myself checking how long I still have left till it ends..not because I\\'m bored ..but to see how much more of its goodness I still have time to enjoy..it\\'s that precious!A beautiful series with wholesome characters that deserve the world ! It fuels some nostalgia and makes you revisit those sentimental times of your first love..\\r\\nIt has one of the most gorgeous scenery..every frame feels like it\\'s taken from a Ghibli movie!,Very relevant to our lives, so many struggles. Most dramas are showing only the good side of life, but this one is not. The spirit of Hee Do n Yi Jin inspire me, no matter how much they\\'ve been dumped.,One of the best Kdrama i have ever seen Can\\'t wait for the next episode In each week it getting interesting more and more The plot twist and flow of the story was excellent and mesmerising I love this series so much The romance, comedy, action, motivation real life truth shown in this series hits hard while watching it, I hope it ends on good meet.,Watching after completing stressful exams, it is so much refreshing.

LOVE IT.Hope it will end with HAPPY ending..,Yes it is for sure it would hit\\r\\nAnd indeed it has something or I say it has everything to get so\\r\\nNomatter whatever happen but it is a cake that everyone one on their birthday.,10/10 for T5T1 and Nam Jo hyuk, Kim tae-ri and other supporting roles. I\\'m in love with...T5T1 right now. I\\'m badly and eagerly waiting for the release of new episodes on weekends.,Ongoing in high power.The story is set in 1998 and tells the stories of youth who find new direction and growth after having their dreams taken away. Two people first meet when they are 22 and 18 years old and fall in love years later when they turn 25 and 21.Na Hee Do is a fencing athlete whose high school team was disbanded due to the IMF crisis. Although her dreams appeared to have collapsed in front of her, she forged ahead into her future without giving up. Baek Yi Jin is the eldest son of a family that is torn apart due to the IMF crisis. Despite his difficult background, he works hard to become a reporter.Go Yoo Rim is a fencer who is on the national team, and the rival of Na Hee Do, who is the same age as her. Although she showcases a fierce charisma as a fencer, she turns into a cute and lovable person with a hidden steely core when she takes off her fencing uniform. Moon Ji Woong is a social media star who is aiming to become Today\\'s Member (a highlighted user) on Cyworld, Korea\\'s top social media network of the early 2000s. Ji Seung Wan is the top student at school who hides a secret wish to rebel.,Brilliant acting by the cast, takes one down memory lane. It feels alot like like Reply series minus the parents ofcourse. The struggle is real and its raw and emotions of youth. Highly recommended.,Very refreshing drama and really sweet, but what makes it stand out is certainly Nam Joo Hyuk! He is wonderful in every way. His eyes, expressions, body language... make every scene he is in so much more intense.,Twenty Five, Twenty One is such an inspiring TV show with heart-warming love&friendship stories and tons of humorous touches(the most hilarious show I have seen this year).

Therefore they had been often confused for one another since high school. But the biggest confusion was yet to come, as the first\\'s ex fiancé destroys the second\\'s wedding, believing that she was his ex lover. And the story gets even more complex, but fortunately, it is easy to keep up and it actually quite interesting. The fact is that the drama keeps you entertained up until the end, though the last episode wasn\\'t as good as the rest of the series. Though the secondary stories weren\\'t as good (actually they were kind of foolish), but the main one was really good. The romance was great, with good chemistry between the two leading characters, as well as great performances, that give out laughter and sadness as well. So, 8 out of 10.,There are two Oh Hae Youngs, one is beautiful and successful and one is ordinary and plain. They went to the same school where the ordinary one was continually embarrassed for sharing the same name. There lives become linked again through one man Park Do Kyung who has foreboding visions of his future. An excellent cast with highly entertaining stories of their own, and a truly outstanding performance by Seo Hyeon-Jin who wears her heart on her sleeve. A great series which captures moments and approaches in different relationships, with families, friends and those they love.,An innovated plot, with the terrific acting of two excellent lead couple. Male lead is hot and musculine. Female lead is famous of acting in comedy. But I must confess that I am a bit tired of the fussy girl female lead is acting in every of her drama. Simply looking for something new from her.All in all, an ok film though.,Episodes.Oh Hae-young (Seo Hyun-jin) grew up in the shadow of another girl, who went to the same school, who had the same name. Things finally seem to be going right for her in her adult life when she is on the verge of marrying Han Tae-jin (Lee Jae-yoon) an attractive businessman who is worthy of bragging about. However, the day before their wedding, Tae-jin breaks it off saying some very hurtful things. Park Do-kyung (Eric Mun) is no stranger to heartbreak, his fiance did not show up on the day of their wedding. Do-kyung finds out that Hae-young is going to marry another man, Tae-jin and Do-kyung and his friend formulate plot to ruin the husband to be and stop the marriage. Do-kyun is a successful sound director who supports his brother and his widowed mother. His mother is looking for a wealthy husband who just so happens to have the right connections to help Do-kyung carry out his plot. Only problem is he is breaking up the wedding, and ruining the husband to be, of the wrong Hae-young. Now there are two miserable, jilted, people who fatefully cross paths and find solace in each other. Hae-young does not know Do-kyung, who she is drawn to as if by fate, is the very person who caused her current unhappiness. Can a relationship built over such a deception last? Tae-jin is acquitted and returns to reclaim his intended bride. Will Hae-youngs feelings rekindle? The other \"pretty\" Hae-young returns and decides she made a mistake and wants Do-kyun back, will her beauty and style win back Do-kyun? Can the \"normal\" Oh Hae-young step out of the shadow of the other Hae-young and realize her own worth?I liked this one but I didn\\'t love it. Some of the posters showed dolls and such so I thought it would be a lot more comedic than it actually was. The characters said things to each other that I cannot imagine anyone saying to someone else and that person still liking them. They also say things about other people and life that is a bit shocking. I really liked the side romance. I also liked the main male lead\\'s sister and his friends. The story was compelling, the romance was sweetly satisfying but there were times, when I felt angry or shocked at things the characters said or did. I also found that it dragged a bit for me, in some areas. And her mom was strangely abusive to her daughter. it was good but I didn\\'t think it was great. Totally worth watching but not a list topper.,An initially interesting start devolved into an utter, cringy mess.\\r\\nThe premise of this show was somewhat interesting, but I literally hated every single character in this show. Seriously. Every. Single. One.\\r\\nAt the start you kind of like the cast, but within a few episodes they grow annoying, and eventually just straight up intolerable. Do Kyung is boring and emotionless. Hae Young 1 is a screaming, crying nightmare. Hae Young 2 is a spoiled princess brat. Both Hae Young and Do Kyung have AWFUL mothers. Do Kyung\\'s older sister is just weird and obnoxious. His younger brother is annoying and immature, and his girlfriend acts like a 12 year old. They are also all alcoholics (except for Do Kyung who \"doesn\\'t drink\" but then he does every time he gets really upset?). This was a mess, and the seeing the future story line was the most interesting part and it really wasn\\'t that great in the end.\\r\\nAnd the soundtrack! OMG if I had to hear those same two songs one more time I felt like I could have been pushed to murder someone! Just awful!\\r\\nSkip this one, it is a waste of time.,It was very infuriating how the male lead character played by Moon Eric very passive and unwilling to fight against a fate he believes he deserves. That did not help the story at all and pretty much suffocated the atmosphere of the whole series with heavy feelings. Sometimes it felt so hard to watch or even finish the episode. This series could have been a gem if the lead character was given the willingness to not accept the consequences and to unearth the truth.,In the beginning of a few episodes, not a fan of the leading she is messy, clumsy, plain Jane, really crazy, always wasted, really pathetic, no self-confidence, talks trash & frivolous.Her ex-fiance is more handsome than the lead actor.The leading actor is considerate, sweet but fickle-minded.His ex-fiance is definitely more pretty & sweet.The actor mom is despicable! So hard to watch! She is so abusive! She uses her son, take advantage of him, gold-digger & thoughtless!Do-kung is lucky to have a bestfriend that cares so much for me, including his younger brother & the 3 guys that works for him when he is sad. They are there for me, no question ask!I am very surprised that I actually like the drama & will see it again! Their chemistry is awesome! The kissing is so swoonworthy! Definitely worth watching even again. Loved it!,When I first started this K-Drama, I didn\\'t have much expectation for it, nor was there anyone in the cast I was particularly smitten with (they were all \"new\" actors to me). However, I changed my mind within a few episodes.As romantic K-Dramas go, the plot did contain some of those \"impossible coincidence\" cliches, but overall it was a fairly fresh story. However, IMO it was the the acting which really carried this film, with emotional and believable performances from the entire cast. Also, aside from the somewhat heavy/dark main story, there was plenty of humor on the side to lighten the mood.This show also deserves acknowledgement for containing possibly the raciest make-out scene I\\'ve ever seen in a K-Drama (it is in one of the last few episodes). Don\\'t get me wrong, clothes stayed on and no beds were involved, but considering how limited physical romance usually is in K-Dramas, I was still duly impressed that this one didn\\'t pull any punches in it\\'s portrayal of normal adult passion.If you like K-Dramas and make it through the first few episodes, I think you\\'ll be glad you did. Recommended!,I got through the show quickly because it was simple and funny. Mainly, the simplicity of this series has left no one bored. The concept with the sound director fascinated me from the start until the end and how his profession has found a delicate place in every scene. The delicate tones, noises, sounds sounded like melodies. How he handled it carefully himself only added value.I adored all of the moments associated with the tone. Recording his singing as a child. The recording of her confession of love. After the experience that he always left his recorder on when he was on work, I felt the need to listen to them too. The shot of the night and in the wheat landscape. The whole process of recording sound in a movie was interesting to see.The appearance of the two people with the same name should have been modified somehow. They were both very different and both very beautiful. But the main character was always put down with her clothes, which I couldn\\'t understand, because at the beginning of the series we could see her nicely dressed and feminine.However, if she did this on purpose because of her boyfriend at the time, then it\\'s very mainstream. There are also clothes that are less feminine and still give a person a certain charm, here they were only presented in a bad light.The series has only acted about their looks and that of others. She put beautiful people in the upper class, portrayed her former friend as God just because a beautiful person was with her. If so, then the other Miss Oh couple wasn\\'t made for each other either because of his average look.However, her character traits did not go hand in hand with her insecurity about her appearance, as she always seemed very self-confident even about the outside world. A little contradicting.Even the supporting roles were unrestricted and exaggerated, worst of all I found his younger brother\\'s relationship, which I hated to see on screen, while I loved his sister\\'s relationship but found a bit excessive and too little screen time. So I think the acting skills seemed a bit unsteady, but actually it was the exuberance of the characters lent.This affected everyone except the male protagonist who, in my opinion, was limping a little with his acting skills. The whole drama with Miss Oh Ex, who broke up with her because of her eating habits and that of his mother, could have been skipped, at least that he wanted to kill the director. I found that this idea had to be weighed up better. I would prefer a different concept or less around it, because it seemed to be set in order to fill the time.In the end I can briefly summarize the exaggerated behavior of the characters, because it is in a way embarrassing and cringe. The only significant characters with a lot of meaning behind it were her parents, who adore their daughter, although the actions have not always represented this.And in the last episode, where she begged her mother to move in with him and after the consent, the camera shook when the door was slammed. Did you notice?,Absolutely loved this - This show made me laugh so hard but it also made me cry just as hard - the cast was so good and the 2 main characters were amazing - I wish the show would never end but it did and thank you for such good ending .. what am amazing show.. now that I\\'m done watching it I will watch it all over again -I\\'m just in love with the male character.,I really really liked all the characters they were great but the main character -Eric Moon- absolutely loved his character and just could not get enough of watching him- he played his character so well - the kissing scenes were the best kissing scenes I have seen in the Asian dramas- on a quest to find more shows with Eric ..,First, I\\'ve only seen 2 episodes, but I\\'m hooked. The premise is original: thinking you ruined your ex- lover\\'s wedding, but actually ruining a complete stranger\\'s who happens to have the same name as her. I\\'m curious about what happened in the past and what will unfold in their future. There is a surprising amount of interesting characters in the two main characters\\' lives; I\\'m expecting more character growth than just the main two.Second, there is just a dash of fantasy with the precognition aspect to make it interesting. I love the character, Lee Jin-sang\\'s response to his friend\\'s new talent (played by Kim Ji- seok, who I\\'m relieved not to despise this show, because I know he\\'s a good actor who usually plays despicable characters).Third, it\\'s fascinating to see range of responses to the cancelled wedding and how Oh Hae Young (Seo Hyun Jin) responds to different people.Edit: I\\'ve now seen all the episodes. It stayed strong throughout; it kept a dash of humor in each episode, too. Definitely one of my favorite K dramas.,I\\'ve watched my fair share of k-drama.\\r\\nSo far, you start noticing the repertoire Of ROM-COM where two guys are battling for the love of the main actress lead. But with \"Another Miss Oh\" I find a more refreshing palate. Two main lead are going through the motion of falling in love but too many obstacles in their way. Main actress is funny and just lays her feelings all down in the open. Main actor is reluctant because he had acquired new phenomenal power and had seen what the future potentially brings. But throughout their journey, you can\\'t help but fall in love with these two main leads. Their chemistry is bursting through the screen and I couldn\\'t help grinning at times like an idiot 😜. You have the support of all the supporting characters and each role played is an essential contribution . So basically, you got the best friend support, the disapproval of parents, the crazy yet funny sidekick(s) that gets you through the rough days...I mean, I could watch this drama over and over again and this is coming from someone that doesn\\'t like to repeat already watched movies. It\\'s heartfelt and their kisses and hugs make me believe in true love. You\\'ll laugh, cry and even get frustrated but all in all, just wonderful. So it\\'s definitely a high recommendation for me and hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.,Eric\\'s acting suckssssss . Even the supporting actors much better than him!\\r\\nThe female lead also have really freak annoying character\\r\\nIts boring!,The story was indeed very unique. Their humor also very funny and had me laughing even at some ridiculous things. My problem was with the male lead character, he\\'s just very annoying. His character is just a coward and selfish in so many ways. Oh hae young literally pleaded to cry for begging him to stay, but all he did was walking away. And all of the sudden, he got back with her just to save his life.,The whole series tries to make the protagonist look like a vulnerable and great guy. But The big problem is that he destroyed another guy\\'s marriage by accident. He hides this fact from all the people who are affected by the marriage being called of. It is a torture to watch the episodes where they are trying to build romance between the protagonist and the girl whose marriage he destroyed. When I looked at the rating for this series it made me really sad. Wow, so many really enjoyed watching a screwed up plot. In addition to the ridiculous screwed up plot, the show also gives the protagonist a psychic ability to see future. This is so random and useless. The three star is because there are aspects like the Oh\\'s (girl) relationship with her parents that is cute.,I really liked its comedic moments which frankly, comedy isn\\'t one of my favourite genres but it was really good. The romance aspect was good too and you could see how devastated both the leads were during the darker times of their relationship.,I couldn\\'t finish this drama due to the toxic relationship between these two, I don\\'t get why she was so obsessed with him meanwhile he still hadn\\'t forgotten his ex. Besides this I didn\\'t like the acting at all, but I have to say that the concept of the sound director character it\\'s pretty interesting.,I\\'m on my 3rd rewatch. This time, I\\'ve been made to appreciate even more the production quality and the outstanding acting of both leads and all the supporting cast. The direction as well as the OST are great too. Highly recommended., Good enough\\r\\n, Love comes at you like a storm\\r\\n, Well written plot\\r\\n, Interesting but not amazing. Good but not great.\\r\\n, Awful Characters That Ruin the Show\\r\\n, Could Have Been Better If It Wasn\\'t For...\\r\\n, Awesome drama! Loved it!\\r\\n, Worth Watching\\r\\n, Redundant concepts and embarrassing characters\\r\\n, Loved loved!!\\r\\n, Kiss\\r\\n, K-Drama fan EAGER to see more\\r\\n, Best K-drama so far....\\r\\n, Boring & bad acting\\r\\n, Good plot, just some annoying characters\\r\\n, Horrible plot\\r\\n, Decent kdrama\\r\\n, Toxic relationship\\r\\n, Outstanding series!\\r\\n,Review of Season One:KINGDOM is the second top-notch zombie production to come from South Korean, following the film TRAIN TO BUSAN. This one\\'s a six-part Netflix miniseries that explores a zombie outbreak during the Joseon dynasty. The series is a strong mix of GAME OF THRONES-style political intrigue and plotting with plenty of zombie action; the zombies themselves are fresh and frightening, thanks to some twists with the mythology and 28 DAYS LATER-style speed and ferocity. Netflix have really gone to town with the production values here and many of the visuals are good enough to make framed prints. The scenery and sets look luxurious and the costumes are brought to life in glorious colours. A small but distinctive cast, including Doona Bae, play characters with depth and humanity. In between the zombie attacks there\\'s endless plotting, twisting and oodles of suspense, while the stand-out set-pieces in episodes three and four are among the best I\\'ve ever seen. Needless to say, I can\\'t wait for season two...Review of Season TwoThe second season is a slight step down from a first, but only a slight. The zombies only really pose a threat in half of the episodes and for the rest the new focus is on political intrigue, which is present times ten. I found some of the plotting to be slightly over-elaborate; the whole issue of the queen and her child was already fully explained in the first series, but seems to take up a lot of space here. Plus I always find flashbacks to be a slightly lazy way to pad out the story; GAME OF THRONES and BOARDWALK EMPIRE suffered from them too. Otherwise, there are still great production values, strong performances and expert choreography to enjoy, and a left-field twist at the climax ably sets up a very differently toned third season.,Set in Korea\\'s Joseon Period when, shortly after the king is taken ill, a mysterious plague starts to threaten the nation. The remains of a doctor who had died shortly after treating the king were eaten by starving peasants and shortly after they became ravenous zombie-like creatures, attacking anybody they see, spreading the condition. Crown Prince Lee Chang, the King\\'s illegitimate son, starts to investigate. Rumours spread that the king is in fact dead and that the Queen\\'s family is waiting for her to give birth; hoping if she has a son he will be the next king not the Crown Prince. When the Crown Prince is declared a traitor the army is deployed to find him.If you are a fan of zombies but feel most films/series are just more of the same these days this is a must see. Those infected by the plague might not follow all the standard zombie rules but the way they move at speed and as a mass adds to their scariness. These beings also are apparently unable to go out in the sun and seek shelter at night; this leads to tension rising as dawn approaches. The setting adds to the feeling that this series is something new; not just a different country but also an historical period that provides different problems to our own, notably the rigid hierarchy and palace scheming. The combination of court politics with zombies might seem an unusual mix but they work to give a great story. Everything looks great with beautiful scenery contrasting with the brutality of the action. The cast is solid, most notably Ju Ji-hoon, as the Crown Prince; Bae Doona as Seo-bi, a physician researching the plague; Kim Sung-kyu as Yeong-shin, a mysterious tiger hunter; and Kim Sang-ho as Mu-yeong, the Prince\\'s bodyguard. The main plot lines are nicely wrapped up after two seasons but new details leave things open for a third; I have no idea whether there will be more though. Overall I\\'d say this is definitely one to watch.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.,I was recommended to watch \"Kingdom\" by a friend, as he knew I love everything zombiesque, and somehow the South Korean horror drama \"Kingdom\" had managed to elude my radar.With \"Kingdom\" readily available on Netflix, I sat down and watched all 6 episodes of the first season in rapid succession. While \"Kingdom\" is no \"The Walking Dead\" in a South Korean interpretation, it is still a rather enjoyable TV series because of equal parts zombie action and storytelling.\"Kingdom\" is somewhat hindered by a rather slow pacing, that while it definitely helps the movie and story, it just made me feel that it took the series forever to get up in gear and to become good. But the slow pace was necessary, I suppose, because it helped establish the character gallery quite well, while offering bits and pieces of adrenaline-filled segments to the audience of things to come.While \"Kingdom\" is not following the average (and generic) zombie formula, it is still a very enjoyable show and it is an interesting approach on a zombie outbreak. One thing that I am usually not enjoying is agile, fast and running zombies, but it actually works quite well in \"Kingdom\" for some reason.This is a TV series where zombies are a part, yes, but it is not a TV series about the zombies. No, this is a drama about well-defined and nicely portrayed characters and their quests for survival, hunger for power, revenge, political plays and such.The TV series have a very nice ensemble of casted actors and actresses to portray to the various roles and characters in the show. I was definitely more than pleasantly surprised to see Doona Bae (playing Seo-bi) in the show, and she brings with her a lot of grace.The zombie make-up is adequate, and it serves its purpose quite well. As stated above, this is not a TV series about the zombies themselves, so it is not richly endowed with gross and ghastly special effects displaying gore and other such grim things that are often a major part in the zombie movies and TV series. Was that a good thing or a bad thing? Well, naturally as a massive zombie fanatic I would like to see as much blood, guts and mayhem as possible, but the toned down brutality and gore of \"Kingdom\" actually suits the theme and atmosphere of the TV series quite well.The downside to \"Kingdom\" is the slow pacing of the story. While it was a mere 6 episodes running just short of an hour or so each, it felt much, much longer. But it is hardly a deterrence for me to shy away from season 2 if it should make its way to Netflix.\"Kingdom\" is definitely well worth watching if you are a fan of the zombie genre, and need something to fill the time in between other zombie shows.,The Zombie and chase scenes are very exciting. The production is lavish and the sets are grand. Actors are good too including Doona Bae. The crown prince is good too. The historical story is interesting so it is a good blend. The zombie logic and explanation are quite plausible. A few faults. Many characters look alikeand dress alike. Confusing. Some middle episodes are a little dull. The first season isn\\'t enough at all - it\\'s just like half a season. You have to watch both. In the first season too much was in the dark. Improved in the second season.,It hasn\\'t been a mystery that South-Koreans can make very good movies but now Kingdom shows that they can also make quality shows as well. Kingdom is only two short seasons long (plus an additional long episode that came out in 2021 called Ashin From The North) but it\\'s addictive to watch. The cinematography is just on top, and the acting for Asian standards is certainly not bad. Okay you have the occasional overacting from a couple actors but overal it\\'s all very well done. Like Sang-ho Yeon\\'s Busanhaeng (Train To Busan) the zombies are just something different than the usual thing we\\'re used to. South-Korean zombies don\\'t wander around slowly looking for brains like in American movies. Here they run like they are the next Usain Bolt and that what makes it suspenseful. The make-up is all very convincing, credits to the make-up artists for that. I binge watched the two seasons in a couple days followed by the extra long episode from 2021 which explains a lot in the end. You don\\'t necessarily have to watch the extra episode but it\\'s of the same quality and certainly worth watching. Kindom is another example why I love South-Korean cinema. They are the best from all Asian countries and that by far.,Hell yes! The characters are interesting, the concept of zombie apocalypse in a medieval era and very well found, and the political intrigues add to the tension all the way. A beautiful little South Korean masterpiece that has nothing to envy to big Hollywood productions.,Kingdom: Set in 17th century Korea, a tale of court intrigue and Zombies. Some great Zombie Horde scenes, sword fights and battles. Just finished Season 1 (6 episodes). 9/10. S2 arrived on Netflix yesterday.Season 2 of Kingdom is just as good, the Zombie Horde scenes are perhaps even better. The palace intrigue continues along with Civil War. 9/10.,Zombie theme been filming like 10000 times but this one totally unique and special. Once you watch the first episode, you can\\'t stop. It\\'s just amazing for all the chasing, killing n most importantly the storyline. Can\\'t wait for season 3.,Season1\\r\\nA series that deserves much more success. A season 1 too short unfortunately, but six intense episodes. The cast plays very well (there is Bae Doona, an actress whom I like very much!), The characters are interesting, the concept of zombie apocalypse in a medieval era and very well found, and the political intrigues add to the tension all the way. The best zombie show I have seen, personally. A beautiful little South Korean masterpiece that has nothing to envy to big Hollywood productions.\\r\\n.......................\\r\\nSeason 2\\r\\nKingdom doesn\\'t reinvent the wheel, but it does add new twists to the zombie mythology by introducing the quasi-vampiric nature of its flesh-eaters.,2020 #230:THE KINGDOM S2 (NETFLIX)Surprisingly the story comes to an end with this season and leaves an opening for a third which I desperately need to see. Whereas the original had terrific, intense horror action setpieces and a fare amount of setup. This is pretty much all battle with some truly crazy ass twists. If your a fan of train to busan definitely check this series out its fantastically entertaining.4.5/5,Train to Busan rates as my favourite zombie movie, well this definitely rates as my favourite zombie series. So much more sophisticated and fascinating than The Walking Dead as an example. No surprise given the excellent offerings out of Korea.Cinematography, costumes, makeup, plot, script, acting. Soaring!! This is seriously top drawer on any level.The intricate plot has so many social subtexts and complexities that it will fascinate even the most demanding critic.A must watch and I definitely can\\'t wait for Series 3!!!,First season awesome surprise.\\r\\n2nd one was not able to finish, lost interest in the developments of the story.\\r\\nmaybe I retry 2nd season again.\\r\\nzombies fan do not miss season 1!!!\\r\\ntry 2 episodes.\\r\\ncheers,With so many zombies movies and shows, it\\'s surprising to see fresh ideas that are smart and entertaining.Kingdom was an excellent show. I loved the setting, in which the plague happened during the old time where monarchy and royal blood were the real deal. Going straight to the theme here, the show did not focus on the zombies, but instead showing the humans as the real monsters. The plague was just an opportunity to show the injustice and abuses from those near the throne. This is similar to The Walking Dead, which also showed the worst in people.The main character, the Crowned Prince, was the grand opposite to the royals. He was similar to those shounen protagonist in anime, but because of how evil the other royals were, I couldn\\'t help but rooting for him to take his rightful place on the throne. Other characters were good as well. Some of the deaths were heartbreaking or great sacrifices that showed how loyal some of the characters were.The premise behind what caused the plague was entirely new that I did not expect. I wasn\\'t entirely sure if this is realistically possible tho.Korean zombies always have unique and scary looks, and their designs were again great in this show. Despite not being super gory, the running and aggressive zombies were still scary and heightened the urgency.Overall, an intense and thrilling zombie show. 8/10 for season 1 and 9/10 for season 2.,Historically set Korean Zombie series. To be honest the acting is descent, the storyline solid and they have thrown cash at it.\\r\\nBut they do have the craziest hats!,A special feature-length episode and a sidequel to the second season of Kingdom. An invigorating and satisfying revenge thriller with a staggering performance by Jun Ji-hyun.They better be not make Ashin as a villain in the upcoming season. I want her to be the main star of the series from now on.,I\\'m halfway through this now (having a hungover lazy day!) and I\\'m liking this. Episode 1 is a bit slow but then it picks up. I\\'m drawn into the story so that\\'s good. Now, to see this bad boy through to the end! 7/10,I watched 6 episodes for 6 hours in one spot. Gosh, I was so absorbed by the story, and it felt like 2-hour movie. The power of well-knitted story and the attractiveness of supporting actors fulfill the series.Korean settings and the cinematography to amplify the beauty are pleasure to watch. Especially, the costume is realistic and symbolic as well. The sadness behind characters is applied to the costume.,Just when zombie films may be headed over the hill , we get this fresh , beautifully rendered, exceptionally acted drama . This action is well paced , the violence makes sense , the plot , costuming and setting are gorgeous.\\r\\nIf you are a fan of the genre do not hesitate to watch this . If your new to the genre , this is as good as it gets serving as crossover series: drama , suspense, character development and world building.,This is the best Zombie series, I have ever seen. Calling this series as Zombie would be wrong. It has thrill, mystery, suspense and everything that I usually looked into series. It kept me edge of the seat whole time even I couldn\\'t blink. My words won\\'t be enough if started praising for it. I can\\'t wait to watch its new upcoming season.,The concept of feaudal Japan with lone wolf samurajs and zombies Is a cool one.\\r\\nBut like every japanese/Asien zombie production they fail 100% and makes It look like comedy instead of horror.\\r\\nAll these overacted twitching transformation scenes are hilarious.\\r\\nSome turn to zombies in 5 seconds getting bitten in the foot. Some slowly transforms. Kingdom has a Really poor sense of pacing like all the other movies and tv shows on netflix, monsters, alive, train to busan etc.\\r\\nWhats worse is that all zombies are running really fast in this show. Its not scary and its not realistic at all. I give this 0/10 cause of the high score it doesnt deserve. I could only watch 2 episodes before knowing where this was going.\\r\\nKingdom could have been far greater If it looked like 16 assassins and had kurusawas poetic charm. Real dawn of the dead zombies\\r\\nAnd better samurai heroes. Not these loosers you dont care if they all die.,As a 7-year fan of Korean drama and movies (which Netflix introduced me to back then), I\\'m delighted to see so many westerners love \"Kingdom.\" The Korean writers, directors, production crew, and actors took the tired Zombie genre and recreated it (as they also did with the movie, \"Train to Busan\"). They can do it all-historical, detective, war, comedy, fantasy/Time-slip, romance, etc, and are the best filmmakers in the world today.,I like the premise a lot.The zombies are conceptually sound.The characters are intriguing.However, characters choices are often so questionable that it detracts from the excellent plot.Very much: If you would have done this, we could have been there. But now we\\'re here. Struggling.,Zombie flicks are an overdone subject around the world for the past two decades. Most of the zombie movies today have become very predictable, lethargic and boring but Kingdom totally stands out in an ocean of zombie titles, in fact this could be the best ever zombie flick ever produced. The series is intriguing, gripping and intense throughout, with a touch of humanity sprinkled within. Kingdom is actually two different stories of different genres beautifully knitted together by some excellent writing.Cinematography is excellent, with some exceptional camera work during intense action scenes. Editing is very straight to the point and doesn\\'t drag much. Production design, costumes and makeup are decent throughout the series. Screenplay is excellent, especially for the first season as the thrill element doesn\\'t fade one bit. Director Seong-hun Kim excels and keeps the momentum going. Ji Hoon Ju and Bae Doona have done some wonderful acting, ably supported by good performances by the supporting actors.Overall, Kingdom is a must watch for all horror and thriller fans that is completely binge worthy. The run time is just under 5 hours each season, so it\\'s a quick watch. I am not a big fan of zombie movies, but I really enjoyed Kingdom from start to finish. The series truly lives up to the rating on IMDb. 8/10 for the first season and 7/10 for the second season to a overall 7.5 stars out of 10.,I was iffy on watching this because off all the mixed genres. I was expecting an Asian version of \\'Pride & Prejudice\\' with Zombies.But it\\'s all mixed very well, drama, mystery, thriller, horror with Zombies AND politics, all told in a period setting hundreds of years ago.Believable story with good characters. Well produced too. Get watching.,I simply cannot fault this.Those who say Hollywood take notice are correct. Of course, it won\\'t. We need another series about a serial killer in London at the turn of the 20th century. Or Fast and the Furious 16,There are so, so many zombie movies and even shows around these days. I feel like the zombie craze here in the states is winding down, but you never know. Especially when there are fresh takes on the subject like this series.Like many standout examples of a genre, there is a lot here that is familiar to fans mixed with fresh ideas that liven up the concept. Zombies here follow fairly standard rules when active: a bite is always (eventually) lethal, the death of any infected person adds to the zombie ranks, zombies lose any human characteristics and become maddened beasts who hunt for uninfected to consume, and traditionally lethal wounds only slow them down but things like cutting off their head will kill them permanently.But they\\'ve added a lot that\\'s new and interesting. For starters, zombies are only active at night; during the daytime they revert to your basic corpse. This gives survivors a fighting chance, especially since the zombies are of the fast variety, sprinting rather than shambling. And the plague, instead of being some accidental catastrophe, if brought forth quite purposefully to fulfill certain ambitions and simply gets out of control. Also, the show goes where many films and shows fear to tread with the idea that no one is safe, not even cute little kids or even babies.But the biggest addition, of course, is the setting. Instead of it all going down in the 21st century, it\\'s instead taking place in feudal Asia. This is a nice touch, allowing them to blend some court intrigue with a more primitive society that doesn\\'t have access to secure bunkers or cement buildings with doors you can chain shut. Most everything is made out of wood and enough attention can allow the dead to bust in to just about any hiding place, elevating that \\'nowhere is safe\\' feeling.The series is well acted and set pieces seem authentic-ish for the era. Costumes and makeup are similarly high quality. But my personal favorite aspect concerns the writing. Films and shows like this often have a message or theme they are trying to convey like \\'we work together and live or go it alone and die\\', for example. Particularly in foreign productions, I have often noticed that subtlety is not prized, and you often feel like you\\'re being lectured at. But here the writers definitely have a message, but they also have the patience to let that message emerge organically from the story.I don\\'t know if it\\'s a Netflix production or from Korean television, but I saw it on Netflix myself. There are subtitles available as well as foreign language dubs that, at least for the English language one, seem pretty well done. I\\'d recommend.Edit: Although I\\'m a fan of this show and eagerly look forward to the next season, I did hear one disturbing thing. Apparently one of the crew members literally worked himself to death during the making of this show. Netflix, I\\'m disappointed in you. That kind of sweatshop crap would never fly here in the States (well, mostly never), so don\\'t allow it on your productions elsewhere, even if there is an established culture of unhealthy work hours wherever you produce your material. You have a responsibility and while I love that you are exposing audiences around the world to different cultures, you still need to be an ambassador of the kind of values the world needs, including a healthy work-life balance and fair labor practices.,This fairly obvious connection only slowly dawned on me, because the zombies (wights) in Game of Thrones play a less central role, even if they represent the oncoming winter. In Kingdom, the zombies are a constantly threatening presence, and are conceived more as a form of plague (highly appropriate in the era of COVID-19), rather than the antagonists of a cosmic struggle, as in Game of Thrones (which is admittedly also appropriate in the current cultural environment!),And hit a home run.Originally planned to only watch one episode last night.. Then I found myself up until 6am finishing the entire series. I have not felt compelled to binge a show in one sitting in quite some time. Let alone a foreign series.I\\'m not going to get into the beautiful production, convincing acting and superb multiple story arch\\'s unfolding.I\\'m just going to say, if you like horror and feel like the genres become redundant in recent years. Watch this. It\\'s like one of those mishmash of genres you think in your mind would be great, and wonder why no one\\'s ever done it. Well now someone has,This show definitely deserves the hype it receives! The acting, storyline, cinematography, and special effects, are all amazing. I binge watched this because it\\'s way too good to not! Kudos to everyone involved in this project for creating such a masterpiece and innvovating the zombie genre.,Never seen this korean zombie drama before and it\\'s lit AF,It\\'s just not re-watchable , hence on my scale it can\\'t go above 3/10 .The production value is decent, but the story is generic and drawn out .Acting is wooden and stereotypical, filming and editing good, visuals repetitive, dialogue and storyline dull .To be fair, it\\'s one of the better zombie series , but then again that\\'s not saying much .For binging with your brain turned off it\\'s perfectly serviceable though .,Watched Seasons 1 & 2. Kingdom puts a spin on the usually zombie genre by placing it in the imperial times of Korea. The zombies I can say at least are not just a back drop for another \"period piece kneel before the king drama\".This series actually has a quite a lot of action in it and a plot that is fitting to the theme of the story. In this world the outbreak is caused by a plant instead of the usual virus or people just die and come back to life and we don\\'t know why story.Kingdom tries to fit in a somewhat plausible story and explanation for what\\'s taking place. Some people may not enjoy that as that makes up a good chunk of the series but it is the only thing that sets one zombie movie apart from the other. Establishing how and why people turn into flesh eating zombies does make a difference. The rules for the zombies in Kingdom are different from other zombie shows which does make it interesting.I will note that the series does feel a bit long and talkative at times. There is also a spinoff movie called \"Ashin of the North\". If you haven\\'t seen that movie before watching Season 2 you probably won\\'t understand Season 2\\'s ending very well.I respected the film for what it is which is a unique approach to zombies. It may or may not be for everyone if you don\\'t like period piece movies or fight for the throne stories which also gets tiring since they\\'re 100% of the time always the same storyline (you know someone want\\'s the throne and is scheming to get it, Good king vs Bad king, yadda yadda). This isn\\'t much different in Kingdom but the added use of Zombies makes it interesting.Having watch both seasons and the movie I give this a 6/10. For me the pace was somewhat slower than I liked and there were just characters I found to be quite annoying as well as the solutions to deal with the Zombies.For me this is two series in one. It\\'s an Average period piece \"fight for the throne drama\" but it\\'s also a slightly above average Zombie series too. So you put them both together and it\\'s a solid 6/10 for me.,I love it! Actually I am still watching first season and till now it continues very well. Great story telling between high and up classes, 1x4 perfect drama (it made me sad) , great zombie action, good acting. Everything is so nice. Very watchable.,... I still watched and enjoyed this series. I found the historical context of sufficient interest to keep me glued.,The path to finding really great pieces of entertainment can be a strange one.I was once looking round Quora and had my interest piqued by a question about how a modern military would cope against a Zombie horde. The answers were entertaining but in one answer, someone mentioned that if you wanted to see how armies (albeit those from a good few centuries ago) against zombies might look, to check out the South Korean series called Kingdom. So I tracked it down on Netflix, hit play and sat down.Hands down, this is one of the best shows that I have seen on TV for some years. I don\\'t mind watching Korean films and particularly like Brotherhood, War of the Arrows etc and this was on a par with these, if not better.The writing of the characters was really top notch. Their motivations, their power plays, their slow development was a real joy to behold and none more so than the Crown Prince who grew to be an absolute legend. He was likable, relatable and brave and was supported by a host of equally rich and absorbing characters. You felt that you grew with them, you came to understand them and you learnt to predict how they would react because you had grown to admire them.The show had just the right amount of balance between political intrigue, grand master plans and flat out swords and arrows against zombies which was exhilarating. One of the things that I really liked though was how the main characters and even random ones all seem to act sensibly. There were no occasions when you were shouting at the screen to close the door that had swung open or look out for the guy creeping up behind you.Indeed, some of the tactical and strategical planning involved to combat the zombies was breath-taking and insanely clever.So the writing is on point, the costume work is just amazing as the colours and outfits worn are really quite epic and some of the music is just wonderful. There is a death scene in the show which is one of the most poignant and moving that I\\'ve seen in a TV show due to the characters, acting, music and visuals.I really can\\'t say enough about this production. Its constant quality equals that of the very best episode of GoT (which would be Hardhome for me) and is up there with the likes of The Expanse, Angel and Firefly as the very cream of TV entertainment.It\\'s probably the best piece of entertainment I\\'ve seen in 2020 and whilst eternally grateful to the guy from Quora who suggested it, I cannot recommend this enough. If you are looking for that undiscovered gem of a production that hasn\\'t yet gained mainstream blanket approval then this really is for you.,This show is one of the best zombies tv show I have seen and its gory . The storyline is no nonsense and it goes increasingly intense each episode. It one of the best so grab your buddy who loves zombos and watch this stuff.,A phenomenal south korean zombie series on Netflix. Absolutely wonderful.,A tremendous drama since Season 1 to this Season 2. One of the top 10 drama I had watched in these 2 years. There are some nice exciting parts and storyline is good too. The directorship is topped and nicely done. A must watch for the years.,I don\\'t watch medieval soaps/dramas nor foreign language films, but this was pleasantly surprising. Cinematic, well choreographed, down-to-earth acting. Binged in about 1-2 days. The decision made at the ending of season 2 seemed a bit contrived, but hey, I don\\'t mind a few artificial plot devices.,A good zombie apocalypse based in Japan.\\r\\nThe plot is good, acting and special effects on point.However it got increasingly difficult to distinguish the characters as it progress. With the subtitles as our reference and the continuous increase in characters, all wearing similar attire it was difficult to keep up with who was on screen.,A really good fantasy adventure series with zombies. There is a real hero and nasty villains. Only drawback. The only drawback is the lack of good-looking female characters. Great costumes. The sets could have been spiced up with CGI, though.,This show is pretty good but I find myself laughing at the voice over actors. They are so over the top they really sound like characters on South Park. Aside from Bae Doona who I believe is doing her own voice over in English many of the characters make me laugh, and I know it\\'s supposed to be serious. The way the zombies portrayed aren\\'t great either. They have all day to kill these things yet they never even make a dent. They\\'re not scary zombies like 28 Days later and there aren\\'t really all out brawls like The Walking Dead. It\\'s mostly just running and funny sounds that make me laugh. It\\'s entertaining though I guess. This review was pretty worthless now that I read it lol.,The basic fact that I watched through both seasons (12 episodes overall) within just a few days is basically the only thing I really need to say to show how much I enjoyed Kingdom.I like the characters, the setting, the writing as well as the effects and costumes. Putting a zombie plague scenario into a middle age Korean setting is really something new (at least I haven\\'t seen something like this before). I also found the aspects on how the whole topic with the zombies was treated very interesting.At the same time the show is also about the monarchy in Korea around that time and plays quite a bit with the political intrigue aspect. The show has some good twists and turns in season one and two and I hope they continue with the good writing in season three.One little problem I had was telling some of the characters apart. The 6 characters mostly focused on by the story are easy to tell apart (the prince, his personal guard, the queen, her father, the \"sniper\" and the female physician).When it comes down to other characters (ministers and other nobles, soldiers,...) it is much more difficult to keep track on who is who and which side do they belong to. This especially becomes confusing when they suddenly change clothes as for me those are an aspect used to identify the characters (a lot of them have similar facial features and very \"samey\" beards or hair styles in case of the women). I hope they can improve this a bit in the next season. It may give me a reason to watch through the show again at some point.,I love zombie horror, though I know a lot of people are bored with it. This show however gives us an entirely fresh burst of air on the genre. It takes aspects of Korean culture and mixes them with a story about political scheming, human weakness and of course the ravening hordes. Each part complements the others well as the different aspects blend together to produce an excellent story.Though of course it\\'s violent, there is no gore for the sake of gore and instead of excessive CGI we have talented extras with very good makeup. All in all, it\\'s a great show,Excellent! One of the best shows I\\'ve seen in terms of acting, setting, story and music. I didn\\'t see the twist coming at the end, it was an awesome way of setting up season 2, which I didn\\'t know was beginning production later this year. I thought it was a one season and done show. But after that ending, I can\\'t wait for season 2! And the queen wasn\\'t pregnant! I was wondering why they were keeping all those pregnant women in a safe house.,They have done a pretty great job creating a show with wights fighting humans with a backdrop of struggle to power. Pretty edgy and doesn\\'t feel cheap at all in their picturization of war with the dead.,Absolute masterpiece, I was so invested in this world and these characters I loved every minute of it and was so sad when it was over. Can\\'t wait for season 3. Season 2 episode 1 is in the top 5 of my favourite tv episodes of all time it\\'s got truly jaw dropping edge of your seat moments that will stick with you. Everything about this show is perfect you must check it out.,While it is better than 80% of the zombie flicks out there, I feel this series is let down by some horrible over acting. And some ridiculous characters who I assume are there for some sort of comedy value.One minute it\\'s trying to be serious walking dead style horror, the next minute you have bumbling Laurel & Hardy type characters screaming like girls and falling about the place.As for the people giving it a 10 rating...if you consider this a perfect ten, holding it aloft with the Likes of Breaking Bad and the Wire you need your head examined.,At first I thought the show will turn into something surprising after the 3rd episode... but not.\\r\\nAlmost every episode is predictable, unscarry and forgettable.\\r\\nThe only thing I can praise are the costumes and scenery.\\r\\nIn conclusion...\\r\\nSkip it and watch The Haunting of Hill House (2018 -) instead. ;),KINGDOM (2013) REVIEW\\r\\n#thecall #thecallreview #halleberry\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\n📜 Plot: While strange rumors about their ill King grip a kingdom, the crown prince becomes their only hope against a mysterious plague overtaking the land.\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\n👨\\u200d⚖️ Review : If you love zombies and are on the hunt for something fresh, you cannot go wrong with Kingdom.Kingdom is a Netflix Original South Korean horror series written by Kim Eun-hee. The series is based on the book Land of the Gods, which was also written by Kim Eun-hee. First arriving in 2019, the horror series has since become one of the most popular non-English titles available to stream on Netflix.Beautifully presented and dripping in Asian culture, zombie action-thriller Kingdom is quite the thrill ride. With a exceptional screenplay and beautiful production value this show has all the indegrients for an engrossing binge watch.The zombies are appropriately inexorable, and resemble Train to Busan in terms of falling over themselves while chasing the living. These are not sluggish walkers of The Walking Dead. The visual style is unique, and makeup effects are also good. The gore looks pretty much real, and there is oodles of it here.Season 1:\\r\\nSplit across six hour-long episodes, Kingdom effortlessly blends political drama with a thrilling action plot, full of beautifully shot set pieces. Brutal action sequences, engaging drama and horrifying zombies make this show a must watch. Brilliant Direction and Extraordinary Performances by the Cast makes it extremely worth your time.Season 2:Season 2 raises the bar more and is bigger and better. Proves the mettle of Korean storytelling in this genre.\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\n👍Goods :\\r\\n1. Brilliant Production Value\\r\\n2. Rich in Thrills and Horrors\\r\\n3. Outstanding Performances\\r\\n4. Extremely Engaging Mysteries\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\n🔥 Final Rating : S01 - 8m5 and S02 9/10\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\n✅ Verdict : Just Watch This Now.\\r\\n.\\r\\n.\\r\\nFollow in Instagram for More : @RiteshReviews,It\\'s like House of Cards crossed with The Walking Dead crossed with Shogun, but better.Very enjoyable, good script, good acting, great scenery and an interesting plot while retaining all the tropes of Korean drama.Very much looking forward to the next series, this is a show with a real story arc.,Review of season 1 - 2\\r\\nEntertainment value: 9\\r\\nVisuals: 10\\r\\nSoundtrack: 6\\r\\nPlot: 8\\r\\nWorld building and depth: 9\\r\\nCharacters and dialog: 8\\r\\nTotal: 8.5The good:\\r\\nThis is just an amazing series, forget all the other zombie series you\\'ve seen, this beats them! It is extremely intense from start to finish all the while not sacrificing elegance and style. It is very interesting to watch traditional Korean society, intrigue and it\\'s hierarchy combined with the zombie apocalypse. The second season just reinforces the first into a beautiful masterpiece. The visuals is amazing.The bad:\\r\\nThe soundtrack could be more memorable and the dialog is a bit lacking sometime.,Despite the simple storyline, the show is well produced, the acting is excellent, it\\'s exciting, the scenes are gorgeous, and it\\'s fascinating.I\\'m really looking forward to the second season.,I was really suprised how much I liked \"Kingdom\", even though I normally don\\'t like zombie movies/series.The whole setting of Korea in the 17th century with different regions and Clans/Families striving and fighting for power is really refreshing in contrast to all the movies and series playing in the european middle ages. I really liked that.Despite the fact that normally I really dont\\'t like the whole zombie topic, I really liked how they used the zombies and explained the origins and backgroundstory of the whole problem.The combination of this two \"genres\" is really good and something nice refreshing in the world of series. And if you like zombies more than I do, \"Kingdom\" will probably be even better rated than it is rated by me. Enjoy.,The human nature conveyed in this series will be more complex and changeable. The plot, suspense, historical elements also make it more colorful.The human nature conveyed in this series will be more complex and changeable. The plot, suspense, historical elements also make it more colorful.,I just finished binge-watching Kingdom. I\\'ll now explain my headline lol. Here is my review. The story takes place during Korea\\'s medieval Joseon period amongst a mysterious plague. The shows pacing is perfect. The acting is impeccable and all the actors and actresses did incredible. The action was absolutely epic af. No exaggeration. Blood and Gore galore. The battles are the Koreans version of GOT. Korean anything in cinema is my absolute favorite. I feel like they reinvent the wheel constantly for outdoing their previous entries all the time and that \"us\" as American Filmmakers can learn a thing or two from them. The money they invested into this show definitely shows with each episode costing a tad more than 1.78 million dollars. The cinematography is to die for literally lol. The shots in both the action scenes and dramatic yet everyday scenes that were filmed are superb. The tension of the shots is evident at every angle. If you never liked reading subtitles prior you need to fix that crap immediately because this show is so worth it. I hope and pray that they make a season two because as it stands this is my favorite show of 2019 and it\\'s only January and this will undoubtedly remain my new favorite show. Netflix was smart to invest in this show. Horror done right. The zombie design was magnificent in the most grotesque way possible lol. The few plot twists they had in season one were definitely unexpected to say the least.,I do not understand the many gushing reviews. Yes, the series is visually stunning. Yes, the combination of zombies and medieval Korea is original. But the characters are all very one-dimensional and the scripts are by far the weakest point. Not worth your time.,Kingdom is a relatively less-spoken-about show (at least in this part of the world) as compared to other Netflix shows that are often blown out of proportion. But this underrated gem is a sheer masterpiece.This is one show that I have been eagerly waiting for a season 2. Season 1 ended on a strong hook-point and season 2 starts exactly from the scene where season 1 ended. Right from the start, you are rest assured that the show is on the right track and not taking any unwanted shortcuts. The storyline is a natural progression on Prince Chang\\'s journey to reclaim his throne while continuing to fight with the plague outbreak.For the uninitiated, this is a zombie thriller and what adds to the impact is the South Korean period setting. Apparently it has one of the most deep-rooted story setups amongst zombie films - a genre which is often relegated for its restrictive or repetitive and gimmicky approach. This is not your typical zombie film with characters running away from the undead in varied settings. The series has an intrinsic story of greed and power (simplest reference: Game of Thrones) with the zombie outbreak working as a perfect backdrop. But when I say backdrop, it does not mean that the execution of the zombie part is any less effective or thrilling. There is enough and more of zombie bloodbath! The treatment is more gory than horror and could be repulsive than scary. But for lovers of the genre, the blood and gore are enjoyable enough.While Season 1 was more about the setup of the outbreak, Season 2 explores the narrative deeper. After its grand entry in the first episode of season 2, the zombies predominantly come only towards the final episodes. But you don\\'t mind that since the makers spend time on good storytelling. And when the zombies arrive in the climax, they come in huge numbers and the action is on grand scale.Season 2 is intrinsically connected with Season 1 with several flashbacks and back stories well explored. Some existing characters get more precedence. The storytelling is very simple yet effective and never gets pretentious or convoluted. The fast pace keeps you hooked to the proceedings.Kingdom is a show where everything from writing, direction, performances, background music, action, period setting and production values is just perfect!Like Season 1, even Season 2 ends on a strong hook-point leaving you hungry for more. However this time the end is somewhat abrupt with the introduction of a random new character who\\'s conflict or future contribution is unclear. One can expect an all new chapter to open in Season 3.Whether you are a fan of zombie genre or Korean cinema or period piece or none of these, you might still enjoy watching Kingdom for its compelling storytelling. Give it a try. If the zombie bug bites you, you will surely come back for more.,Not just the best Zombie Tv series but the best Tv series ! I was amazed at how good this series is. The acting from all the actors is superb . There are no weak links. They all fit in with each other. No expense has been spared . The sets are fantastic as is the cinematography .The Show has the that atmosphere that it is happening in a different era . It is very hard to create that. There is suspense and thrills throughout , as well as \\'ah ha \\' moments . It is not predictable at all . The surprises in the show are powerful and have a strong impact , yet they are subtle and sophisticated.I can\\'t wait for Season two. I would highly recommend this Show. It makes TWD look cheap, tacky and amateurish . Who knew South Koreans do it better !,It is a good show with astonishing visuals.waiting for season 2.,Netflix Kingdom is like a lot of Netflix shows.\\r\\nIt has huge production value, more so than most of Netflix shows.\\r\\nThe costume design, the practical effects and VFX for the zombies, all the details in Korean culture, the landscapes, the different colors et cetera. They all really feel like the show is taking you into that certain time.The first 6 episodes were also really good in action, when delivering so. Also the last episode had some really slithering tension and really great built up, leading to a cliff hanger. Don\\'t really know what to think of that, but I\\'ll take it for now.But it also falls for the same tropes of many Netflix original shows. First, it has some pacing issues. The 3 & 4th episode in particular feel practically only like retelling the second episode and in all these 3 episode the only thing happening is actually zombies killing people in villages. That leads to a dragging narrative for quite some time.The other flaw I had with it where the lacking characterization of many characters. While it looked gorgeous on the surface, the substance wasn\\'t always there to back up. It certainly touched on themes like royalty, treason & honor, but it never gave its 3-4 characters at center much time to fully come to life.The acting & humor is very Asian-like, so you\\'d have to be prepared for some of these jokes, as the performances are very much like one would expect from a Korean production. But that\\'s not really a flaw if you have your expectations.If you really don\\'t care about much substance, or explained depth narrative than the show is absolutely perfect. It\\'s zombie action, put into a unique setting, with unique ideas and themes.\\r\\nI\\'m probably gonna check the second season out, so I\\'m curios what they are going to do after that cliffhanger.6-7/10,Season 1 was great. Season 2 big let down, too many plot holes, too numerous to list. Last episode of season 2 turned the show into a complete farce.,Brilliant from start to end I am not fan of zombie movies but it was amazing better then walking dead and games of thrones .. waiting for season 3 it will be sure brilliant,The kingdom is gripped with uncertainty, the King is rumoured to be dead, the Crown Prince has been marked a traitor. The King\\'s second wife, the new Queen, is pregnant and is setting up her unborn son to skip the official line of ascension to be King.\\r\\nIn the midst of this Game of Thrones style politicking, there is a strange disease afflicting the land. The dead are not staying dead and at night roam the land hunting the living.\\r\\nKingdom is packed with thrills, action, gore, stunning visuals and a well thought out plot. The acting is great and the characters nuanced. It also has been picked up for a second season so there really is no excuse.\\r\\nNetflix picks another great foreign series to pick up. If you like your zombies with subtitles, if you like your period drama with gore and if you like great television then Kingdom is definitely for you.,It\\'s hardly a secret that the zombie genre is a dried out well proven by western releases fighting to be the most boring and generic junk out there. Then to my pleasant surprise South Korea dishes up a series set in a Korean dynastic kingdom in 1897 where a crown prince tries to save his land from the horror. And it does it well. Good acting, believable costumes, lovely cinematic and the monsters blends into a wonderful time that makes this series worth your time.,When i first read its by Netflix i though Yes !! A good zombie movie! Then i read its Korean and i thought.. uh its gonna suck for sure cause its an asian zombie show but WOW the zombies were amazingly well done!Amazing acting by all the hordes of zombie actors/actresses as well as amazing work by the Makeup Artists. The story is also very entertaining as the actors all draw you in with such cleverly compelling acting + facial expressions to tell the story regardless that its a dubbed audio.If you Liked The Walking Dead?? Then you will loved this series much much more.If you like zombie shows/movies then prepare to be amazed cause this tops my list for all things zombie related.,I have not read the comic source of Kingdom, so I can only judge it based on the Netflix TV series version. For a long time zombie flick fan I must say that this was a surprisingly fresh take on the zombie sub-genre set in medieval Korea. I would imagine that people living in that era would have been stronger, more savage and handy with weapons, thus they would fare better in a zombie apocalypse than their 21st-century counterparts. Alas, many of the characters especially the would-be victims act and think like modern people. They bicker and stay frozen in times of dire situation. There are a lot of posturing, waiting and being shocked by the horror that surrounds them. The series would be scarier if these characters would display their savage nature and still horribly die in the face of unstoppable zombie horde.This leads me to my second biggest criticism of the show: the extras should have spent more time in zombie-acting school so they could move, run and behave like a zombies. Instead most of the time these Korean zombies were running like a mob of hobos. The outbreaks of zombie epidemic becomes more like a mad dash of rioters during a clothing sale at the local mall.Other than those main complaints I thought the first season was fun, fresh and an interesting take on a zombie sub-genre. And the production value was really high and sometimes it feels like promotional videos for Korea tourism.I\\'m certainly looking forward for the second season, and hoping they will improve the intensity of the show so it\\'s closer to what I had experienced with Train to Busan. I\\'m also a little disappointed that the end of the first season reveals the nature of the infected horde, which made them more like the Wights from Game of Thrones.,Horror, to me, has always been a dicey genre. The last horror genre film i completely enjoyed was Gong Yoo\\'s critically acclaimed film \\'Train To Busan\\'. However, when i started watching Netflix\\'s first Korean Original web cum television series- Kingdom, i was completely taken away by the way mastermind scriptwriter Kim Eun Hee (of Signal fame) has intricately woven the plot. Set in between the 15th and 16th century Joseon Era, Kingdom portrays how easily the foundation of a huge empire can crumble down and create havoc amongst the people, in the wake of a terrifying plague gripping the country. What makes Kingdom shine brilliantly is its ability to keep the viewers hooked till the end, of not only one but two whole seasons. Each episode has been beautifully crafted and planned, taking us deeper and deeper into the sinister world of the Royal Family, the horrifying secrets unfolding one after another, as lead actor and protagonist of the series, Crown Prince Lee Chang ( Ju Ji Hoon stands out in a never before seen manner) strives to find out what happened to his father.\\r\\nCredit has to be given to the mesmerizing cinematography which has enchanted us via the magnificent and breathtaking sets. The way each shot lingers on a scene, giving time to the viewers to appreciate the exquisite landscapes of the countryside, villages, cities, royal palaces, is absolutely gratifying to a whole new level.\\r\\nGet ready to be pushed to the edge of your seats, as you hold your breath in anticipation every time the zombies come snarling and hissing, ready to lunge at any visible targets. I assure you, even if are not a fan of thriller-cum-horror series, do give KINGDOM a watch. You will feel yourself falling for its ingenious plot, filled with surprises and twists so sharp that can make you go reeling, as you keep on pressing the \\'Next Episode Button\\' and hope that your favourite characters survive the dangerous circumstances coming ahead of them.\\r\\nI absolutely enjoyed \\'Kingdom\\' and really urge you to watch it, not only because of the power packed acting, but also the way a kingdom affected by an unfortunate crisis, fights back and tries to reconstruct itself.\\r\\nPlease do not miss this one!,Its a world best horror darma web series, its give all edge of sit experience, with a new concept this series not give u chances even bink your eyes,\\r\\nI definitely suggest you to watch it, its is historical zombie horror series.,#Kingdom\\r\\nRating - 8.5/10\\r\\nReview :\\r\\nThis show contains elements of horror, action, thriller and even mystery.\\r\\nSeason 1 was thrilling and exciting with many twist and turn.\\r\\nSeason 2 gives a deep meaning of being selfless for the sake of others, sacrificing and above all protecting your country.\\r\\nDon\\'t give it another thought just watch it straight away you will never regret.\\r\\n#NETFLIX,Zombies yes, stunning scenery and superb acting/story line which in itself is something that isn\\'t often not what you associate with a film about the undead.\\r\\nInteresting little twist to add to the zombie knowledge.\\r\\nThe buildings are just great along with the costumes.\\r\\nMy only disappointment and its the only one is that there are no chainsaws, this may be remedied in the second series, who know!!!!!!!,From the start this is an excellent production. The set is beautiful historic. Period clothing very nicely done. Acting is great. Writing fantastic. I haven\\'t seen a zombie theme in a looooooong time that I can say anything great about much less remember. This one is a breath of fresh air.Very well done. Worth a binge.,This is the a very stylish action and horror show. The scenic sets, production and photography is absolutely stunning. It is a visual feast to enjoy. The storyline is quite simple. People are being attacked by zombies that are infested by some kind of disease. And they attack people to spread the desease. And people are trying to flee or fight this zombie epidemic that threathens their lives and civilization. This may sound stupid, but it is highly entertaining in its simplicity. It is hard to be really scared, but it is intensely action packed with fantastic photography. It is like mixing a Samuraij movie of Kurosawa with a modern action and horror flick. All presented in a fantastic package. Get some popcorn and be ready for some intense enjoying action!,Horrific, creepy and darkly comical. Loved the scenes where the two prisoners in neck stocks attached to each other, one becomes a zombie, chasing the guy he\\'s attached to, the other guy running, but they are attached and cannot touch. Mother attacking her child, children attacking adults, zombie wearing comic play happy mask. Also, the Mayor hitting on the nurse and she starts to diagnose him with gonorrhea. Suspenseful, nice comic relief. Fast running zombies. Well done (the entire series, some of the zombies).,Kingdom will be the best of its genre once you start waching it.\\r\\nIm an indian, and in my mother language is Tamil, we have n number of kings novels from our language ancient authors but not many of them were filmed as movies. So we were enjoying Game of thrones and Bhagubali only. But now the history expands it self with KINGDOM.Despite of its similar path on the story base as other king stories In my adulthood, this is the solid king story that made a huge impact on me, a perfect writing that has flawless storytelling and the best versions of the actor\\'s characters.\\r\\nEvery episode encouraged my way of watching with the uniqueness that period films only gives.This piece of art will be cherished in the future worldwide, i WISH.,The story is your typical king/prince betrayal with a zombie twist BUT the characters are boring and not very likable. Frankly it hard to care what happens to anyone in this movie. Hell the only character I had any care for was the traitorous Queen and that only because I wanted to see her get eating alive which doesn\\'t even happen........The acting was okay but the script was pretty poor.The sure as hell is no where near as good as The Walking Dead or Fear the Walking Dead.....Was looking forward to a zombie flick in such an era but damn this is bad..look elsewhere cause this is pure garbage.Dang so many shills giving this over 5 star rating....if you want a good story line, good acting and great fighting scenes watch Into the Badlands instead!,I normally dont care much for subtitled shows, but this one surprised me.\\r\\nIt was really well done, and aside from the occasional subtitle that wasnt displayed for long enough, thoroughly enjoyed it.\\r\\nCant wait for the next season,KINGDOM was brilliant and in my humble opinion, vastly superior to many of the other zombie series out there today. It\\'s certainly one of a kind, a new breed. It was only enhanced by the Joseon historical setting and alternative history presented by the directors. It was excellently written, casted, directed and acted. Great production and cinematography. Beautiful settings, lifelike costumes and realistic storylines. Epic battle scenes and zombie costume/cosmetics. Dark, gritty and cutting edge series.I really loved the cast, especially Ju Ji Hoon as Crown Prince, and Bae Doona as the nurse Seo Bi. I also really enjoyed the character of Kim Sang Ho, as the bodyguard Moo Young. His character was extremely likable and I loved the dynamic between he and the Crown Prince. Kim Sungkyu, as Young Shin (the Tiger Hunter) was a very compelling character as well, playing a mysterious warrior with a shadowy past.Ju Ji-hoon is excellent in this series. His portrayal of the tragic Crown Prince character is really note-worthy and he plays the noble hero turned warrior very memorably. It\\'s great to see his character grow and conquer new obstacles, and become a person worthy to inherit the throne.One of my main critiques is this. As a big fan of actress Bae Doona (Stranger), I did feel like her true potential wasn\\'t being utilized in this series, but that seems mostly seems due to the direction and writing of this series, rather than any issue on her part. I truly hope to see her character allowed grow and shine in future installments as she is a wonderful, diverse actress with a lot of acting range.This series brought so much to the zombie table, so to speak. I found the \"truth\" behind the plague to be fascinating and unique. It was a truly intriguing twist. Also, this series does not shy away from highlighting both the good and evils of humanity, offering a glimpse at human nature and morality. It was a truly stunning show. I\\'ve now watched the complete Kingdom series and am hoping for further seasons in the future. This was a great new addition to the kdrama thriller and horror genres.This review is for seasons 1 & 2STORY: 10/10\\r\\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: 10/10\\r\\nART/DESIGN/VISUALS: 10/10\\r\\nMUSIC: 8/10\\r\\nOVERALL RATING: 9.5/10.,If you like zombie films or foreign horror then this is likely for you. Its not exactly a korean the walking dead, its horror is more subtle and less visceral but it works when its employed to good effect. The production and scenery is of a high quality. I found the acting to be good and the crown prince central role interesting and well drawn, developing as series progressed.The plot has alot of new things to add to the genre as well as the obvious cultural place and time shift to usual zombie flick. All in all good entertainment if zombies are for you,Only to find it is another rubbish walking dead movie so boring even the flies laughed them self to death, just because it is Korean hello netflix flix of with this rubbish.,One of, if not, the best zombie show ever created.,When I started watching this series I didn\\'t know a great deal about it. I expected to be a a Korean drama with zombies set in the past and lots of sword fighting. I was not disappointed. It was exactly what I expected and a little bit more.First of all, I like the mythology of zombies in this series as they remind me of the traditional image (not the Hollywood version) of another monster whose name starts with v.Then after the first zombies appear, the court intrigues peaked my interest more so than the walking dead. Which mean there are more layers to the story and the suspense comes not only from the survival point of view but also form the character motivations. Another good point is that every episode is edited to perfection, there is no dragging along, no fluff to fill the time. The series is focusing on telling a story.Visually, it\\'s top-notch, beautiful scenery and terrifying zombies. I\\'m hesitant to say it\\'s historically accurate (well, because of the zombies) but I shook my head when I heard people want a strong female character in a period drama, just for the sake of modern trends. The old Korean society had strict hierarchy and the role of women was strictly domestic. Let\\'s not start a dispute about depiction of history.I have 2 negative opinions about the first season of the series (as of writing the only one). First, the way it ended. Huge cliffhanger. Not a big complaint as the second season will come out this year, too. Second, another part of the ending. It wants to be a twist but it\\'s unrealistic. I know I\\'m talking about realism in a zombie movie again but everything up to the last episode was perfect. Perfect explanation for everything and no obvious plot holes. It\\'s bugging me that two consecutive nights are so different from one another.If you want to enjoy it, just watch it and be surprised at the plot twist, don\\'t try to use physics to verify the possibility of some stuff. It\\'s an amazing series. Way better than Walking Dead.,I Can\\'t believe I never heard of it and found this series by just searching \"similar\" Train To Busan options to watch on Netflix, I looks they haven\\'t spent too much money on marketing but using it all in the series.\\r\\nIf you are fan of zombie movies we are talking about here in having excellent production, acting, excellent drama and plot (very original), the landscapes are great, soundtracks (terrific). The minutes for each episode are good too (not to large or short, just perfect timing), no unnecessaries and borings refillings episodes like TWD, it gets better and better after each episode. I don\\'t have any cons about this series, the only issue (just because of my fault) is that sometimes I couldn\\'t recognise some of the main characters (an asian with beard and hat looks all the same to me), so I was a kind of lost sometimes but it was not the end of the world. You can feel there is a high professionalism behind this series, **wake-up call to TWD**. Can\\'t wait for season 3, I hope they don\\'t screw it up. :),How could the producer only create 6 episodes for 1 season?This is one of the best zombie film in the world! Although in Korean, the series deserve to supersede any Hollywood zombie series. There\\'s no cliche or cheesy moments. Everyone is there as they should be. Not every one has strong character, but the protagonist and antagonist surely fits the profile.,If you are a fan of zombies, this is a MUST! I can\\'t remember last time I felt panic and fear while watching zombie film/show. Holy smokes!\\r\\nI\\'m hoping tonight I continue this nightmare in my dreams... xD After 5 episodes in a row, I think I will prob have nightmares.,These two seasons serials very interesting, because for me it\\'s my first time to watch zombie with korean kingdom\\'s background. Good plot and thrilling horror actions. Great performances from the actors and actresses. I\\'ll wait for the third season.,I mean, it basically has everything for me - a fight for the throne, beautiful settings and outfits, interesting characters, and zombies. There aren\\'t many great zombie series out there, and Kingdom is definitely one of them. There\\'s really little wrong with it if you\\'re looking for an entertaining zombie series with a compelling plot. It might not be for those who are tired of the zombie tropes, but I have yet to reach that point. Can\\'t wait for Season 2.,A medievel age zombie apocalypse concept itself is enough for this successful series,great acting by the lead cast....typical political thriller carried neatly with parallel zombie plot makes more impressive...Slow pace at some episodes demands necessity to build the plot...Overall another entertaining and breathtaking series which does make Hollywood biggies envy...,Stellar Cast. Great Acting. Awesome Actions. Good Pace. Magnificent Story Line. Wonderful Production. Altogether, one of the best kdramas ever made.Everything about this drama is top notch! One should not miss this.,I\\'m an adult and zombies scare the bejeepers out of me, but this looked really artful and interesting so I gave it a try. After a couple of episodes I was no longer afraid and really engrossed by the story. This is, no joke, the Asian Game of Thrones, only not as violent and sexually explicit. There was humor, but it was very subtle. The story has gotten quite intense. The characters are keeping me interested. The settings are beautiful and the music is stunning. I\\'m very much looking forward to more. My husband and I binged the first season in one night.,I don\\'t like the whole zombie genre, but I really enjoyed \"Kingdom\". The creators took a whole different approach to it and rather than do the whole apocalyptic dystopian future thing, they did it in a historical setting with skilled warriors.Also a small detail, but makes soo much of a difference, is the dubbing. Its done really well and with a more authentic accent as if they are speaking English, unlike alot of dubbed programs where its either/and off sync, or has voices that clearly don\\'t match the actors appearance on screen.Over the recent years, Korea has made some amazing movies and series and this is definitely one of them.,It\\'s too exciting. The film alleges the past and the present. The monarch is incompetent, the bureaucrat is corrupt, and the people are forced to alienate. It can be said that it has great depth and significance. Unfortunately, there are still some bugs in the plot. For example, all people will not be eaten up by the zombies, but will become new zombies.,What a great show!!!!! There is not one duel moment in one single episode, I hang on to the edge of my seat the whole freaking time!!!! This is a change of pace from TWD and FTWD, the writers and directors need to take a good look at what these people are doing, and take a page out of their book!!!! I gave up on those other shows, they are to drawn out and boring!!!!!!!,First of all, it has already used a huge amount of GOT soundtracks, if you listen closely, you can hear Ramin\\'s Coronation and the White Walkers\\' theme, which were used not only once, but multiple times.Second, the characters were basically the same. A prince who\\'s promised ended up being in a desolated place, fighting the dead for his people and the kingdom, sounds familiar? It\\'s Jon Snow, but this time he went south, not north. A vicious queen, with her father\\'s help, gained the power of the nation, granted by the marriage with the king himself, sound familiar? Because it\\'s the Lannisters ! The queen is Cersei and her father is Tywin, even their characteristics are basically the same.Third, the dead were afraid of the sun, ok, that\\'s interesting, I thought that at least there\\'re something different, but until the last episode, that twist is the last straw that breaks the camel\\'s back: they weren\\'t afraid of the sunlight, but instead, it\\'s the temperature that scared them. What it\\'s implying is that the dead can move when it\\'s COLD, which month do you think is the coldest? Which season is it? And which season would the White Walkiers invade Westeros? Just think about it, they\\'re almost nothing in this series are original, what\\'s even worse is that there wasn\\'t even that much plots and characters to make this show more interesting than GOT, and what\\'s more is that the plot still follows the basic stereotype of the Korean drama: using the extreme characters to create an extreme situation, there\\'re only bad guys and good guys, and the bad ones are always extremely evil, they\\'re heartless, cruel and selfish, and the good guys are always honest, caring, and upright, the plot in this kind of dram just always have to satirize the government and the class system, which were already satirized in almost every Korean movies and TV shows.I\\'m sorry but I just can\\'t see why people keep comparing it to The Walking dead, because it\\'s nothing like TWD, I mean NOTHING. It\\'s GOT its copying right now.The settings, the direction, the pacing, the actors and the production were fantastic as always, but the plot is just too familiar to be good.,I don\\'t know how or where this show got all these good reviews. We tried to keep an open mind but by the end of the second episode I felt like I was losing brain cells.,I think this TV Serie is worth to watch because:\\r\\n1) good story ... i think you like the storyline and after watching 1 or 2 episodes you countinu to watch\\r\\n2) short story ... they say what they want to say in only 12 episodes,\\r\\n3) good acting, Actors preform their roles very good and real,Liked the first season and watched the much awaited second. The second season continuous the same tone as left in the first season,makers taken serious effort to make the details perfect . The writing is mature and on point for which the writer is already well known. They left you with an open ending which is okay for me. One of the best zombie shows up there.,Season season is lil bit upsetting. Main cast was about to take throne from queen. Just said child is not kid from kings blood, but why it has changed and rejected his throne just after battle. That was too dramatic and annoying. That was just the spot to take his throne. And also scenes that zombies bite people like real are too few in whole season 2. Szn 2 is lil bit upset. 8 rating for first szn, 7 for szn 2.,I found this Korean zombie series better than walking dead. This series is like a Korean version of zombie in game of thrones. The zombie , story everything about this series is fresh. This series even likes to the non zombie lovers.\\r\\nThis series was a big surprise for me . I never expected it would be such good . They exicuted the series a large scale with limited budget. They keep 2 season with 6 episode each so there is not a wastage of single second. The graphics, action sequences, charectors, story were outstanding. I highly recommend to watch it . It would have been a great lose if you miss it.,Worth a watch. Season 2 ending makes little sense though.Would easily be a 9/10 if they had gotten that right.It seems that they threw all logic down the drain towards the end.,Just awesome! Excellent! I can\\'t wait for more! I love this korean series! This is probably more excellent quality than some any hollywood movies!,There are wonderful reviews about this show so I was very eager to watch it. The first episode was really good. The scenery was beautiful and I loved the intensity and intrigue. I love zombie flicks and then throw in a Korean period piece....what\\'s not to love?!\\r\\nBut by the 3rd episode the tone completely changed and it seemed like the show didn\\'t take itself seriously anymore. I hated the bumbling buffoonery of some of the town leaders. The zombies became like all the B rated horror movies that we laugh at. It was cringe worthy and I couldn\\'t stomach it. Very disappointing.\\r\\nI might have to give it another try though.,The quality of each episode is a bit reminiscent of the Peaky Blinders (o.k, or any good series) where each 50 odd minute segment has the presence and pace of a feature length film.\\r\\nThe infected are gifted with the stamina and athletic running abilities introduced to this genre by Boyle\\'s 28 days later. Overall it is very good. The narrative is well woven between the Prince and his trustworthy bodyguard, a royal power struggle, a wandering nomad and an altruistic nurse. Well worth a watch.,Really interesting combination of ideas. Fun new approach to zombies. I don\\'t mind dubbing. The problem with this show is the characters are written to be pretty idiotic, with a few small exceptions most of the people are unbelievably dumb. Some of the plot points are pretty trite and ridiculous, even for the genre. The style and setting are so different it\\'s interesting but really suffers from some poor dialogue writing. Potential...so much potential.,The story is not new at all but the execution is totally original and pulse pounding. The cast of hundreds must have been a nightmare to direct for all those frenetic chase scenes. Very well acted and directed. Kudos to the South Korean tv and film industry. Reminded me somewhat of the Wailing A horror story with heart and a little humor.,Kingdom is far different from TWD.\\r\\nYes they both have dead people that pose a danger to the living, but the execution , cinematography, and the frenetic pace in kingdom is very different, as are the huge battle scenes.\\r\\nAnd please! Those comparisons to GOT are ridiculous.,This is my first experience of a zombie show, binge watching in two days and I can\\'t agree more with all the hypes! It\\'s just sooo brilliant! I love every single thing about it, amazing casts, superb story plot, impressive zombies, splendid cinematography, literally every single thing. I am so amazed with Ju Ji Hoon here, he perfectly portrays himself into the character. And I also love the queen, her acting is so great till you can feel how cruel she is. Even after finishing the show, I still browse its behind the scenes because it\\'s simply hard for me to move on from such a brilliant show. Trust me, you\\'ll be so amazed and thrilled with the concept, quality and Ju Ji Hoon\\'s charm. I really can\\'t wait for the third season and hope they won\\'t end it sooner *finger crossed*.,This is my first try of K-drama and I am pretty surprised. I normally don t watch vampire or zombie TV/movie after too many seasons of The Walking Death. But a zombie show set in Joseon period is kind of new and intriguing.The story is strong and intense, never a dull moment. Execution is good and the fighting scenes are remarkably made. Characters are entertaining and deep specially the Crown Prince. The only character I feel can explore more is the female doctor.The lead actor (who plays Lee Chang) is very good and I really like him after this show. Great acting from a lot of supporting cast and overall, a very good entertaining show that is worth the time.The only disappointment I have is the ending (season 2) where the Crown Prince just gave up the throne to a commoner baby, which he knew is the son of his guard, this contradicts the whole story line, the audience are led to believe that blood line is very important in the succession of the throne and that the royal blood should be preserved. I shall look forward to the third season and hopefully Crown Prince will let us know why he did what he did.,So intriguing and clever. Nice to see something that\\'s not the same thing I\\'ve and over.,One of the best shows on Netflix right now. I did not expect the show to be that good. Good scenario, good acting, suspenseful and great cinematography. I want the season 2 now!!!,10/10 for costumes and production. Acting is good. Characters are likable. But what bothered me (and I cannot get over it), why didn\\'t they kill those people at the very beginning? They knew going for the head would put an end to those \"monsters\". Why did they try to contain them in the hospital? They are sleeping during the day (hiding in dark places, looking dead and not moving). Just cut off the head of everyone of them and it\\'s done. After they escaped, yes, it was too late. And there were too many other infections. It seems they thought they could cure the \"disease\". Maybe that was the reason. But really? With people looking like this? Just go during the day, cut off as much heads as you can -- and it\\'s done. In almost every other zombie flick those undead are a danger during night AND day which makes it hard to kill them. But those were mere vampires with no powers during the day.,The series has a complex story-line which makes you want to watch continuously. Everything is spectacular from costumes, cinematography and settings....It has everything from the drama of Game of Thrones and the horror, action and suspense of The Walking Dead and Contagion-Zombie shows.....would love to have more 6-Episode Seasons ..,The kingdom is one of the best shows made in recent times. It is very well-paced and keeps you invested in the storyline.The fight for the throne and a zombie attack it kind of feels like what Game of Thrones tried to do with a similar situation where they had white walkers but unlike the game of thrones where they built up the white walkers thing for so long and we never got a pay-off here, we get to see them battle the zombies.Even the fight for the throne is an interesting storyline. We as the viewers are shown how the lives of the people are affected when someone vicious is on the throne and that\\'s why it feels necessary to get someone new on the throne.The show keeps you on the end of your seat most of the times and wondering what is going to happen next. The action sequences are handled well throughout the show.Hope you give this show a try as it\\'s really good and probably better than anything that Hollywood is offering as of now.,I first watched this in Korea, without dubbing or subtitles. Even without being able to understand anything they were saying, the acting and imagery was addicting. Now back in the states I re-watched it, dubbed and fell in love with it all over again. you don\\'t want to miss season 2\\'s ending, really hoping a third is coming too. Maybe by then I\\'ll know enough Korean to understand it all.,The Busan tour in the costume palace version is too exciting! Complete 6 episodes in one go. The thrilling atmosphere is created just right, the editing and photography are all film-level, and it is worthy of being produced by Netflix. Like Pei Douna, looking forward to Quan Zhixian in the third season. Always laugh when the zombies ran out of their lives, they all ran too fast and too fiercely! It\\'s really hard for this crowd of actors,Zombies in middle Joseon-era Korea? Hell yeah! We\\'ve got sword play and Korean kick-ass martial arts to satisfy action junkies and zombie gore to satisfy zombie junkies, all in one series. Firearms are not the primary weapon but swords and human ingenuity are, which present a real sense of struggle in the middle-ages. The zombies are living human-fast but not cheetah-fast (e.g., World War Z), are afraid of water, and are cognizant of day/night. Or is it temperature? Ha Ha Ha see the latter to find out. Having zombies that run as fast as the living makes sense - they can catch up and quickly dispatch you. With slow walking zombies (i.e., Walking Dead, FTWD), it is hardly believable that with a minor trip or wrong turn, they\\'ve already grasped you tight enough to mark your doom. The zombie characteristics in Kingdom make this show very disruptive to the zombie genre, much for the better because they bring new ideas to a genre that has shown story-line fatigue through its enduring front-runners (i.e., calling out TWD). The characters are relate-able and the acting is high quality. There is some comic relief as well. I do not mind reading subtitles because I\\'m used to watching international shows and movies - and you can also learn from them. A terrific show - Netflix DO NOT CANCEL IT!!!!!!,This drama makes very effective use of suspense and these zombies are not at all sluggish, slow-moving, or entirely brainless. The biological explanations for dead humans running and trying to eat living humans seems pretty plausible. The only thing lacking is intimacy in the series--you don\\'t really get to know any of the characters intimately, there isn\\'t much character development, and relationships don\\'t really evovle and develop. But in terms of a plot-driven storyline this drama does a great job. Sometimes the shock effects seem gratuitious and uncessary especially after the viewer is introduced to the zombies and have a good idea of how they operate. Scenes where a character is being stalked and pounced by these zombies during the last few episodes seem a little pointless. Suspense is really only exiciting when the predator is unknown and not well-understood. Otherwise, we can pretty much predict what the monster will do.,If it wasn\\'t for a GQ article about this show, I would have kept passing it by, as I have been for the last month. Just finished the second episode and I know the rest of my Saturday will be shot.The production quality is amazing, the pacing is perfect and the story compelling. Haven\\'t even finished the season and already psyched there will be another one!,I am amazed by the storyline. It\\'s very well written. Just perfect. I didn\\'t expected it would be this great.Loved it.,The acting is great, the cinematography is incredible, the production value is outstanding, and yet we are left with a plot that is pretty simple and predictable for the most part. I enjoyed this, don\\'t get me wrong, but I was really expecting there to be higher stakes and significantly more tensions throughout. For a horror series, it was only until the final episode that I ever even got a good jump scare. I respect the use of actual extras to perform as the zombies, but holy crap--some of these extras are so silly in their body language/performance/movement that there is no hiding their human-ness regardless of how much makeup you put on them. Characters are very simply defined without much moral ambiguity, increasing the simplicity of the story.Will watch season 2, but this series is not yet ground-breaking beyond it\\'s production value.,A bit slow in the beginning but then it takes off. I\\'m not a zombie movie fan but I Loved it.,I was waiting for this!Perfect show. The acting is very good, the story is amazing!,Always been a fan of zombie films and tv series and this was something else. Rinsed it in a day as it\\'s only 6 episodes which I needed more.Quality of the production and locations was stunning and really made it feel there no where to hide. As I had to places English audio to watch it, at first it was a bit hard but it got quick and enjoyable fast. The style of zombie was really fresh and how they contract the disease was new. The era it was placed in was much better than all modern apocalyptic styles. Samurais and zombies was a good concept. Day they are fine to night was exceptional!The ending with the big defensive push was calm and building the tension reall well till the final moment!6 episodes seemed way too short and it might be another year till I see it again.,Im totally overwhelmed by this exceptionally good korean tv show. Looking so forward for season 3. Script, acting, fight scenes, special effects/ make up, music score, cinematography, set design, editing... etc.. there is nothing to be faulted! I give it a 9.5/10 simply top tv show,Only through the first season but there is more to this korean series than zombies. Well produced, acted and soundtracked. The story behind their existence unravel as episodes go by. These are not your regular walking dead that limp or drag. You\\'ve got to outrun these monsters!\\r\\nI\\'m really enjoying Kingdom.,I thought the zombie genre was far too saturated and nothing new could be done anymore, but this show proves me wrong.This show takes place during medieval time in Korea, and it combines two seemingly very different genres of period political thriller and zombies. This weird combination turns out to be a brilliant solution for some persisting problems with modern zombie films.First is by having characters using medieval weapons, fights with zombies are now so much more thrilling. You can truly feel the danger the characters are in. More importantly, mixing the zombie survival scenes with scenes of political plotting makes for a very interesting and refreshing experience. There will always be something new to keep you on the edge of your seat instead of the tired repetitive jump scares like in other zombie shows.And of course when it comes to Asian horror, you can always expect all out gore fests. There will be no sloppy cuts, just one epic action shot after another. Hollywood definitely can learn a thing or two from these filmmakers.My only complain for the first season is the disservice the script does to the female lead character as she keeps having to deal with silly B plots and playing second fiddle to the male characters.Overall though this is absolutely horror done right, and I\\'m looking forward to the new season!,This show is exactly what one can expect when Koreans adapt the zombie genre for the screen and more. At the end of this review I will tell who should see this and who should stay away.First let\\'s talk about the visuals. They are beautiful, haunting and bring a great mix of epicness and two person scenes. This looks like someone didn\\'t need to think about costs and hence they overspent heavily. These large scale encounters help to immerse into the medieval Korean world.I personally find the acting and mannerism of east asian actors a bit too suited for actual theater and it was at times difficult to discern who is who just from the many scenes that don\\'t need a lot of dialogue and the vast number of actors. But the characters, good and bad are more or less fleshed out, albeit much less than in the \"Walking Dead\"Unlike \"Game of Thrones\", this show does absolutely not feel multicultural. Instead we are shown an intriguing world with a lot cultural background. While the world building is great, the plot is fast and takes a lot of twists and turns in just two seasons. In comparison to the typical hollywood TV-show, the deroulement of the story is fast paced and feels almost crammed. The plot almost never needs to resolve itself by tapping into magic or a deus ex machina situation. Also, some care is given about social differences, justice and responsibility.There is gore and violence but no sex. The thrill is helped by excellent camera work and intense lighting and sceneries. This is all cinema level action perfection.The music, I can\\'t talk too much about it, but it serves its purpose. The intro is great and after a bit of time you\\'ll understand it.When can you see this and when should you stay away? Being a zombie movie genre fan is a prerequisite. Being interested into an all Korean cast in and a medieval East Asian setting is equally a prerequisite. Violence and gore is displayed so don\\'t forget about the PG rating. This is cool and a totally different approach to the zombie genre, give it a try. The intense plot and suspense will make you binge watch this fast.,It reminds me of watching historical korean dramas with my parents as a child and then BAM here come some zombies...,This is literally exact replica of the movie rampant which came out the year prior, also on netflix. Started watching this right after watching rampant. Doesnt seem to bad of a show though not sure if netflix just stole the idea or not,Rating movies and series is different as the very thing is different from each other. When i rate series, i always think about my experience while watching. In this particular series, there was no unnecessary stretching, no fillers wasting time. Characters are on spot and one can feel for everyone. Relationship between them can be felt in a way that you predict what they\\'re going to do next. ( little spoiler: during the interaction between the chief counselor and the Queen also happen to be father and daughter, i felt that the father was exploiting his daughter too much and she is going to protest back heavily. That what really happened) . This kind of relating to characters by audience can be done by a brilliant set of writers.Now the main thing, I have never seen zombies in pre-modern civilization. Zombie slaying by swords and arrows with fancy dress and hats?? I am up.,\"Kingdom\" is \"The Walking Dead\" on steroids.\\r\\nThese zombies don\\'t amble along like your granny with a bad hip. They flat out sprint. And their behavior is part undead, part Regan McNeil a la \"The Exorcist\"-- foaming, contorting, and screaming.\\r\\nFor a genre that wore out its welcome years ago, \"Kingdom\" puts a surprisingly fresh spin on the zombie chase.\\r\\nThe setting is charming-- a China when Emperors ruled.\\r\\nIt is hard to find a connection with the characters, due mostly to corny subtitle translation. But I did find myself rooting for several characters.\\r\\nHere\\'s hoping \"Kingdom\" finds an audience.\\r\\nFor those of us who prayed for Carl\\'s death, and have grown weary of Rick and the tedium of \"The Walking Dead\", this is one tense and at times terrifying alternative.,I had high hopes for this drama. Previous Netflix backed high-budget Korean drama (Mr. Sunshine) was very impressive. So, Netflix plus a team of writer, director, and actors with solid body of work should have amounted to a very interesting show. Unfortunately, the show falls way short of any reasonable expectations. Some of the zombie attack scenes were too drawn out, lasting over 10 minutes. The writer attempted to sprinkle in some elements of humor, which fell flat most of the times or felt extremely awkward. The audience, myself included, is willing to accept the premise of zombies in Korea in the 17th or 18th century. However, that does not mean the same audience is willing to accept illogical behaviors of characters and ludicrous fight scenes just so that the writer can steer the story to where ever it is headed. It was just a forced effort to mix two popular genres with no compelling story line.,Words cannot express how amazing this show is. Direction, visuals, story, acting, action, dialogue, makeup and special effects. All knock it out of the park.\\r\\nEvery episode drew me in and kept my intense attention, making me even shout at the television in pure fear for the characters.\\r\\nAmazingly made and was such a refreshing take to the zombie genre, especially after the Walking Dead became rather mundane and dull.\\r\\nEveryone needs to watch this show.,So, like the middle of the second season. I put a thumbs down oblivious without patience what was coming next. But as before, I remain my case that the story telling is amazing until the kid who wasn\\'t blood related to the throne was saved by the gracious King. However the nurse-Doc surge the baby in the water letting the worms out, but towards the end he was still infected???? That story made no sense at all and doesn\\'t add up. Instead of a 10 giving it an 8/10. Hoping the next season explains the occurrence that happened towards the endsof the kid\\'s journey.,They\\'ve gotten really good at making it looks like people are being chopped into bits for real,Period drama, zombie show and tense atmosphere- this show has everything to keep you attached to your seat till the very end of the season. For the actors\\' strong acting, gripping action and gruesome visuals, and an overall powerful narrative, it is a must watch for horror fans.,I just want to emphasize that this series is through and through decent. I didn\\'t want to have any issues or questions with it due to the engaging story, cutting edge cinematography, incredible actors and genuine horror.So we are led to accept that the two at the medical compound spent around 3-5 days securing the compound, adding spikes around the parameter and inside, fed and watered themselves... And didn\\'t once think to stab the zombies while they slept? Considering one of them is an elite warrior who has no issue in slaughtering the zombies in the hundreds later on, I would have thought his first reaction would be to just off them.While on the subject of the Hunter warrior fellow, why did he feed the people a corpse which was at least a week old? Why not actually go out do what he said and go hunt a deer? If they don\\'t answer that question in season 2 then it devalues the entire show because if it turns out that he\\'s all for the disease to avenge his family then suddenly it all fits and I\\'ll forgive my last two points. But if they leave it unanswered then we will have to just ignore such a stringent point.The bad guys are 2D and do nothing but add filler to an otherwise brilliant series. The long drawn out sequences where the baddies prattle on about how evil they are and how ingenious their plans are just make the eyes roll.My biggest question is what was with the ending? My theory is that they ran out of money. If you think about it the tension of the series was building towards this ending, the story at the pace it was heading needed at least 10 episodes not 6, and the zombies up until that point had religiously gone to sleep at sunrise and woken up as soon as the sun set which doesn\\'t allow enough time for the temperature to change, the zombies also don\\'t react to warmer environments such as a room with a fireplace , being wet ( they\\'d stay colder for longer) and cold misty days as shown in episode 4.So the fact that they dropped in this long drawn out, filler filled last episode which contained nothing but building montages which seemed to be made partially of shop floor footage, conversations which I feel would normally have been cut or spread out over a few episodes and a plot twist so unusual it doesn\\'t make much sense- leads me to believe that they simply ran out of money, time or ideas. Netflix could have turned the money tap off and told them to get it wrapped up pronto for the start of 2019. If we go with this theory then the ending does kind of make sense.Despite all this I would highly recommend this series to everyone. And I just hope Netflix does allow them to finish season 2 without it too being cut short,We need MORE. Counting down the days to hear when season 3 will release.,I really liked this series. First of all the zombies are not the usual slow-motion lame creatures, they are very quick. Secondly the story adds up like a puzzle and every episode provides some more pieces to the whole picture. The favorite thing for me was that the biggest villain was hidden and appeared only at the end.\\r\\nI read that it was censured and it was not allowed to have too gory scenes. Well, I don\\'t know which scenes were left out because it had quite a lot spectacular killing moments.\\r\\nI hope it will be continued soon.,Just when you think you\\'ve seen every possible zombie scenario...Bam! Netflix puts every on notice (Hollywood studios and other streaming services) that they are way ahead of the game! This is possibly the best zombie series or film ever. I know, \"what about TWD\"? Well this series answers, \"what about it\". I loved TWD and respect what it did for prime time television, but \"The Kingdom\" is why you pay for Netflix. It is absolutely incredible, mixing gorgeous cinematography, action, political intrigue, feudal Japan (even though it\\'s Korean made) and zombies! Netflix just keeps pushing the envelope and no matter how many mediocre originals they put out they get some right and big studios will slowly fade away (sadly) because when Netflix gets it right they really get it right! This series, that starts off with 6 episodes has another 6 waiting to be released is worth the 14 bucks a month. It\\'s an easy binge and worthy of our time. 10 out of 10!,I am very stuck as to whether I want to give this an 8 or 9. In terms of pure enjoyment this thing is easily a 10, I started it one evening then ended up finishing it the next evening because it was just so goddamn engaging. The music is incredible, the costume design is incredible, the cinematography is incredible, the action is exciting, the story is gripping. There\\'s the odd goof and \\'why did they put that in?\\' moment that keeps it from being perfect but I would still give it an easy 9.So what is this massive flaw that makes my 9 so shaky?Time skipping.This show has a bad habit of changing the lighting drastically within short spaces of time. It doesn\\'t make an attempt to make us believe that the characters have been staying in that one place for hours, they have no reason to, they just fast forward the day cycles. This is less of a problem in season 2 thanks to a revelation about the infected at the end of season 1 but still happens at least once.However, if you are ready to deal with this issue and are also up for a LOT of violence (I think this show is more violent than Game of Thrones all things considered), this is an absolutely exhilarating ride.,Zombies and people with silly hats. A perfect combination. The walking dead is boring watch this instead,This series manages to mix genres and do it very well. The story develops and the focus changes in a fluid manner that makes sense as it happens. Bae Doona, who was so good in Stranger, has a strong supporting role in this series and the rest of the protagonists are good as well. But the stand out performance is Queen Cho, played by Hye-jun Kim. She is one evil character that you will hate by the end.,Best of suspence if you love zombie series or movie you will love it must watch this series.story is good,Great show from the land of fantastic drama that is South Korea. Some very interesting new ideas on the Z genre, good pacing, nice cinematography, atmospheric soundtrack and a few twists. Was going to give the show the highest rating of 10 but then got frustrated by some of the decisions and behaviour of one of the main character.,Sumptuous, sweeping period drama that captures the horror of a dread disease sweeping across the landscape. Great cast with a chilling ambience keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat from the first moment to the last.,Can\\'t ask for more and shouldn\\'t settle for less. If you haven\\'t watched this yet, and you\\'re into great, history-tinged storytelling that\\'s also fun, flawless acting and a bit of unmatched Korean zombie-action, than you\\'re in for a treat. In fact, I wish I was you.,The show is in Japanese I believe with not so great subtitles. But the English voice over helps. This show is actually really good and the storyline is interesting. The virus and apocalyptic storyline makes sense and it keeps you hooked. This show is worth the watch.,Loved this series, most episodes finished on a cliffhanger.The acting is good as is the special effects.The story is good with great twists, perhaps the game of thrones Writers should have got these guys to write the last season that would have been a major improvement.Season 2 ends on a further cliffhanger, roll on season 3. I hope Netflix signs on the dotted line.,I\\'m a great lover of k drama and horror films and the Koreans do it so well I\\'ve just binged watched all six episodes in one sitting ( it\\'s now three in the morning ) as I couldn\\'t stop watching yes the acting was a bit ott in the beginning it didn\\'t matter and I didn\\'t see the twist coming in the last episode can\\'t wait for season two hear it\\'s got the go ahead if you love zombies and k drama don\\'t miss this,I would not have recommended this series to myself if I could, as it lacks the (intellectual) depth and inspiration that I seek in fiction. I would say it is worth the watch if the setting and the themes speak to you and if \\'thrilling entertainment\\' is enough for you. \\'Spoiler\\' for the themes: these include political conflict in a historic setting and a zombie epidemic.I felt like from some point the series stretches out the story just to stretch out and lacks the willingness to end the story.\\r\\nIt does achieve a lot in a short period of time and is fast paced. It is good at creating exciting action scenes. This series will definitely give you a lot of adrenaline and regularly leave you in awe for the ambitious scenes in the series.\\r\\nYou do get sucked into the story and world. Especially season one is good at building up a narrative. Season two has more episodes that left me kind of unsatisfied, as the political drama could get somewhat tedious for me. Season two seemed to spend too much time trying to move the plot along or resolving conflicts, and spend too less time on the characters and their motivations (lacking the focus of season one). Season two is still good quality, just somewhat less than season 1.,Better than your average Zombie movie sub-titles mean you have to really watch to keep up with an interesting plot line. With good acting and some humour,Drama and plot 5/5\\r\\nhorror 4.5/5\\r\\nHumour 3/5\\r\\nAction 3/5\\r\\ncgi 2.5/5\\r\\nvery much engaging,The strongest part of this series is the story and its not just another mindless zombie series. if you start watching s01, give it a go for first two episodes and it grows heavily on you. season 2 was absolutely full on class. awaiting season 03. awesome..,This is the zombie apocalyptic theme serial have to be made.\\r\\nKingdom = straight to them point, not too much drama, action and push your heart beats fast,Pure genius. It seems like South Korea is the hub for truly amazing entertainment right now. Kingdom and Sweet Home set the bar for this genre. Kudos to Netflix for bringing this masterpiece to their platform!!!,What do you get when you throw together Zombies, a Korean dynastic kingdom, political betrayals, a nurse and a tiger hunter for good measure. You get a brilliantly original series that\\'s what. Kingdom is a massive breath of fresh air into the somewhat saturated zombie genre.It\\'s not quite as complex as other shows, but it\\'s brilliant fun and has more than enough depth to keep you on the edge of your seat. The scenery is fantastic, really adding to the scale of the show. There are genuine moments of horror, loads intense action and plenty of humour too. Above all else it\\'s a really exciting show that is well worth a watch. Good job Netflix, looking forward to season 3!,This show is set set in medieval Korea and follows the story of Crown Prince Yi-Chang who becomes embroiled in a political conspiracy and is forced to embark upon a mission to investigate the spread of a mysterious undead plague that has begun to spread.\\r\\nThe story starts with claims that the king of Joseon is dead and the crown prince should be crowned immediately however no one was allowed to visit the king not even the crown prince himself later at night the crown prince sneaked into the palace to visit his father wanting to know the truth But is caught by the palace guards and decides to seek out the retired royal physician Accompanied by his personal guard Moo-Young Prince Yi-Chang must prevent the advance of the plague towards his home capital of Hanyang while surviving the sinister coup against him aimed towards his removal as the heir to the throne.The show has been dubbed into English but i watched it in Korean the original language the English dub sucks anyways. This show is really good the acting is great and the characters and costumes believable also quite impressive world and set design looks appropriately medieval it has good cinematography with quite a few interesting shots it has very little music mostly background tracks to accompany action scenes some scenes in this show have a huge amount of extras on screen at the same time impressive.This show is great good story great acting Definitely looking forward to season 2. :D 8.5 / 10,Very good, this series is really amazing! It tells of a zombie plague in the Joseon era, the whole story is mixed with Horror, Action, Scary, Drama, Politics and History. Anyway, have to watch!,I have to say that this is absolutely brilliant and superb.As it is in Korean you cannot take your eyes off it in case you miss any subtitles - but you would not want to miss anything anyway.Beautiful cinematography and wonderful costumes.If I could give it 11 I would,This is the best Korean series on Netflix by far. It kept me on the edge of my seat in each episode. The zombies in this series is much different from what you see in Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead so it feels fresh. The political struggle and the fight against zombies makes it absolutely intense. Some of the scenes were riveting. I can\\'t wait for season 2.,This is my first time watching with subtitles,and I\\'m glad i gave it a go. Finally netflix has given something good to watch. It keeps you wanting for more. Story is engaging. The thing it lack is connection with the characters, you don\\'t feel much connected but hey you are being entertained and thrilled what else do you need.,Very slow best scenario with mediocre acting. Beautiful visuals and sceneries. Very good costumes also. But the scenario is slow and boring. You can predict easily the next move.,A very good production but with crucial errors!! The scenario is painfully slowly, with many holes. The acting is mediocre with a theatrical style. Many times you thinking that you watching, Chinese theater!! the way the actors and cabras play is reminiscent of 80s Asian films. For a western viewer, this is almost ridiculous. the costumes are very well made but cannot save the end result!,This is hands down one of the best zombie series/movies. Everything from the acting, to the story to direction and picturization is perfect. Each character grows with the story.It has the right blend of zombie, greed, politics and suspense to keep you guessing.Can\\'t wait for the 2nd season.,By year 2020 if you havnt seen at least 10 zombie movies you either live in bfe Zanzibar or you dont own a tv. There have been more zombie movies and tv shows then probably any other movie theme. zombies have become an entire genera unto themselves and theres really only so much you can do within that genera. To be honest i actually hate zombies unless were talking pre night of the living dead hatian voodoo zombies but those have been forgotten and traded in for rediculous braindead monsters whos entire goal is to eat humans its lazy and been done to death, pun intended. This show however is good on its own. The locations, scenery, and the cinematography are all beautiful theres a cohesive plotline eith all the ingredients needed for a great show and even the zombies, while still annoying do a good job of selling it. The way the actors throw their bodies on top of each other and fall into and onto things is actually pretty convincing and goes along way to sell the feel of the pandemic. Most zombie shows have no real point other then the mindless beasts themselves acting mindlessly and killing for no aparent reason. Overall this is a great period horror/drama well worth checking out,Caught this while flicking through Netflix. A South Koreon production, it can be watched with subtitles or dubbed. The dubbed version is OK as the voices at least match the characters! It is a period drama with a difference.There is something wrong with The King. He\\'s chained up in his chamber. The village of Dongnae, struggling for food, is eating a soup made from human flesh. The people suddenly start to choke and die but one by one they come back to life. Meanwhile the Crown Prince, Lee Chang and his loyal bodyguard, Mu-yeong set off to find out about his father\\'s illness. Arriving at the village they find it ransacked. Bodies are piled under the floorboards so they drag them out. The survivors of the village appear and tell them they must be put back. It falls on deaf ears and when the sun sets the dead wake and all hell breaks loose!This a brilliant twist on the zombie genre, very well made, with some incredibly tense scenes. The part where they are trying to reach the safety of the village with the infirm on two wagons, and suddenly realise that the dead are sleeping under rocks along the road as the sun starts to set, is a masterclass in suspence.Just finished the 1st series of 6 episodes. To say the last episode was a cliffhanger would be an understatement. Luckily there is a second series. I\\'m hooked,I really wanted to keep watching and watching\\r\\nthis is called a great zombie tv show\\r\\nYou couldn\\'t find better than this tv show.,I watched Season 1 & 2 subtitled, I recommend you do too.The plot is the crown prince trying to figure out why zombies are attacking his kingdom, and surviving the zombie horde.The writing is good, acting is good, the zombie effects are good, their traditional clothing is historically accurate.Season 1 is a 10/10, you get to see a zombie horde and its great.Season 2 is a 10/10, you again get a zombie horde but with more mystery and drama.Summary: This show is the best zombie show I have ever watched, I look forward to Season 3.,The best things about Kingdom are its costumes and set design, with some cases of good fight choreography sprinkled throughout the series coming in a distant second place. It was fun and engaging, especially at the beginning, when the plot is moving along fairly quickly, but I started feeling tired by the end of the first season.The \\'zombie\\' theme was already feeling stale and over-explored last decade, and there\\'s nothing particularly original or that stands out about the ones here. Given that, plus a painfully predictable story and several one-dimensional characters, I grew progressively less invested until I finally finished season 2 actively skipping through scenes just to get to the ending.,To bad the producers could care less about subtitles. Didnt even try to match it\\r\\nExample written, \\'I want an apple\\'\\r\\nExample spoken, \\'I am desperately starving. I haven\\'t eaten in months, and have been on a long adjurors journey. All for the sake of saving my sister, whom is dying from a really rare disease. Ect ect ect\\'Would be a much higher rating, if they even tried to come close.,I really like the cast of this drama. Its not your conventional drama that is exciting from episode 1-8 dies down and becomes boring and picks back up towards the end. This drama is shorter with only 6 episodes per season and its perfectly paced and the screenplay is great. The storyline is two fold. On one side you have to deal with the spreading virus and your learning about the attributes of the virus and how it spreads while on the other side you have the political tension between the ruling clan and the crown prince. How the ruling clan is controlling the villages by starving people and making them desperate for help. I like Bae doona\\'s acting too and the drama doesn\\'t hold back in the fight scenes with tons of blood and flesh and animation when needed. Highly recommend this drama to people!!!,Well written, well acted, well directed, perfect cinematography, fast moving plots, Kingdom is probably the best video/media presentation in a zombie universe. Features multiple realistically gory battles against the undead and the darkly visualized consequences usually glossed over in other Z productions but would be inevitable in zombie outbreaks (i.e., turned mother attacking daughter, children zombies, etc.).The beginning and spread of this Z epidemic is reasonably presented and though there are various sub-plots about power, opposing armies, greed, betrayal, conspiracy. The series doesn\\'t degenerate into the familiar human vs human conflicts with occasional zombie afterthoughts and instead remains good guys vs bad guys PLUS zombies.With no over-the-top martial arts or sword-fights, and no conventional firearms (only the occasional single-shot rife, with one excellent display of tactical artillery, impressive for the 1500\\'s), Kingdom is an entertaining, satisfying addition to the Zombie genre.,When I first heard about it, I said to my self not another zombies but when I look deeper I always ask a question about this : HOW DO THEY DEAL IT IN ANCIENT TIMES where there isn\\'t any Guns, Explosives or something. And this series is totally flushed out the toxic from my head.The series is so good and so engaging you really can\\'t get off your seat. The most important thing, some episodes are of 1 hours where you didn\\'t feel like you are seeing the long episodes. Even the flashbacks are little one, and they filmed all this in so beautiful manner, you will gonna love to see their traditions and most importantly the locations. Somehow you can feel the terror mererly seeing the locations in this.Zombies are....you know zombies. What gives you kick in this, their craziness, their running. They reveal slowly about the characteristics of zombies (NO SLOW BURN) and you will gonnal love it.Also you can find a beautiful story about a son, a nations would be king, a cunning young step mother, and one Kingdom to acquire for which they create zombies and used against their enemies (LAST EPISODE OF SECOND SEASON WILL MAKE YOU SHOCK). Highly recommended...,What can I say? Netflix does it again! Great directing, writing, and acting; overall cinematography is 10/10. Can\\'t wait already for Season 2!,If you like Korean movies, if you like political power fights in plots, if you like to watch disgusting sides of the human nature and also the good sides, if you like good acting, if you like period series and if you like zombies you will really enjoy this series. Interesting surprises, very good fighting scenes and really scary zombies.,Finally, zombie genre sees a massive change with this show. Great story, special effects and acting. Highly recommended !!,The best show i have ever watched in my life. Great story, amazing characters, beautiful cinematography and soundtrack. This is the show that everyone involved in the industry should watch and learn on how its done. Just shocked on how briliant this series is. Kudos!!!,I like this series. But the zombie scene is very rare. I hope to see more zombie in story 2.,Best zombies show ever and very interesting show. Waiting for season 2,The only thing better than a good zombie movie, is a good zombie series.I could admit that a few questionable decisions were made to move along the story-line, and a few actions/occurrences were quite predictable (much like Western cinema), but if those things are ignored then you have hours of entertainment that you most certainly will not regret.As a side note, I feel like the writers in most zombie films create problems for themselves the minute they start trying to use science or related logic to try to explain what created the undead..... and Kingdom was no exception. I feel it would have been better to leave that part as a mystery.Still, Kingdom is a must watch.... and if you are like me, that means binge watch. I gave it an 8/10 because I just like zombie shows so I am biased.,The budget is not as big as GOT but it can rival GOT it is much better than stranger things, I am angry because this show is so under rated, the story the action is the best, Not Boring show.,Doesn\\'t have the budget oh big US productions but the plot, characters and acting are way better than other average series.,Zombie movie/series pre 20th century! Finally, I have been waiting so long for this to be made and The Kingdom delivers. The story is on point, interesting and at a good pace. There are no unnecessary jump-scares or over the top gore, it\\'s still scary enough. It rivals the walking dead in the makeup department for the \"sick ones\" and finds its way to top my list of best series amongst hundreds of strong contenders.My only problem is the lack of episodes. The acting is good but I feel like the characters aren\\'t getting \"fleshed out\" enough, maybe season 3 will have more episodes.I can\\'t wait!,I think its a perfect zombie movie. Acting, cinematography, thrill, mistery, storyboard, & of course the zombies. Top notch.,Great show. The fact that it\\'s a period piece probably gave it more life than it would have had, had it taken place in more modern times. Just a little bit though, as it also hits the mark in every other category as well.Its just tense enough for horror, has a good amount of action, and has a nice dash of comedy without drifting into the realm of horror / comedy.Overall, a really great show and I am looking forward to season 3.The only real negative of this show is that each season is extremely short, only 6 episodes each. On the other hand, that allows each season to be focused on what quality, and not drift off into bloat.10/10 would watch again.,Really Korean knows how to make a good movie or series about zombies.\\r\\nIn Kingdom you can see no modern weapons only sword and arrow some old fashioned guns but still it gives you thrill.\\r\\nThe first episode is might be boring but after that it\\'s totaly engaging because of stroy direction emotion and it\\'s action.,This show combines Game of Thrones-esque political intrigue with The Walking Dead-esque zombie thrills, but it\\'s better than both of those shows. Not only is it the best zombie series I\\'ve ever seen, but it\\'s one of the best historical series I\\'ve seen as well.,This new Netflix original Korean zombie series succeeds in surprising with its fast paced narration and a few unexpected twists in a beaten to death genre.\\r\\nThis show takes a new approach by setting the zombie drama in the backdrop of a period show.\\r\\nThe politics of the monarchy forms the content of the screenplay. For the most part the zombie and political part of the show remains seperate but converges as it reaches the culmination point.\\r\\nThe variety of zombie deaths, the types of kills and the adreneline pumping chases are nothing short of great. It didnt hinder the experience in any way.\\r\\nThe locations this was set in,the aerial views and the scenic beauty captured via the lens provides an immersive experience.\\r\\nThe background scoring was good enough to capture and produce the thrill, especially during the final episode.The tone is really dark in this show. Apart from the zombie elements, the treachery and vile of the characters and their actions to protect power is diabolical at the least.The show does seem to slow down in its pace during the middle but compensates with its heart racing finale.The mini plots during the showcase of zombie disease spreading is done well without holding back in its disturbing level.Ultimately, this show is not a complete one and it never intended to be one. It sets up everything for a high potential second season. While doing this, it manages to surprise the viewers during the last episode.This is a short pacy zombie period show which does not demand much of your attention and can be binged as a casual view.PS: If you are new to Korean drama, the antics, goofs and few mannerisms of the actors may seem over the top, but it is sort of unique to the korean culture and is seen in every Korean movie and drama. So don\\'t consider it a flaw in the show,I\\'ll start off by saying, I have not read Kingdom of the Gods, so I don\\'t have a personal bias or history with the IP. That said, this series is really enjoyable. So first and foremost, we have something written and produced in South Korea, so that means a few things. Respect for history, no need to throw unnecessary nudity or sexuality in there, the closest we get are awkward romance scenes. And they\\'re totally fine, not cringe at all.Now, I\\'m gonna say, there\\'s a lot of predictability in this. And some things that seem predictable, but are actually true red herrings. From the get go of the series, you can kind of figure a few things out right off the bat. Yes we can predict exactly what they\\'re doing from the first five minutes, yes the plot reveals are predictable. But to the show\\'s credit, those reveals aren\\'t really meant to surprise an American audience who is used to the zombie genre. This is a show trying to introduce Koreans to zombies in a period drama method.So of our main characters, we have six to deal with. These are your typified archetypes, there\\'s the altruistic prince. He wants to do things differently. There\\'s the prince\\'s best friend (only friend it would seem like). The prince\\'s former master. The vagabond whose skills belie his lowly stature. The herbalist/doctor who wants to try and cure everyone. And I suppose there\\'s the bumbling buffoon coward who will eventually man up and become a power player if he lives long enough. This is your typical hero\\'s journey where the hero loses everything, and has to risk life and limb to save everyone, while also trying to take back his birthright. But it\\'s still such a good series.As I said earlier, there\\'s no nudity in this series (so far anyway), and it\\'s very tasteful. The villains at first seem fairly 2 dimensional and we can guess what their motives are, and why we should hate them. But appearances can be deceiving, and there might be more than meets the eye. But you probably will still end up hating them, because they\\'re your typical vile archetypes who see people as disposable and have a plan. Now unlike American television where they\\'d reveal those plans, they don\\'t tell you what their goals or their motivations are. The Queen seems like a mere puppet just doing what she\\'s told, but is she? What is the Minister\\'s plan? Is everyone the hero travels with trustworthy?I really really hope that there\\'s a season 2 and that it arrives expediently, because I\\'d love to see what happens next. And hopefully more than 6 episodes!,Good story, a slightly new take on how zombies came about. Tense, suspenseful action. I\\'m a fan. Season 2 is out now and so far, just as good as season 1.,Rich in plot and character development, Kingdom is a rare gem that is well beyond the mediocre cinema produced these days. Everything about this series is outstanding. The cinematography, the story line, the costume and scenery, the suspense and element of surprise. The acting! I\\'m in awe. Easily one of the greatest shows of all time, hands down.,This series is amazing. Pretty much every horror show I\\'ve ever seen was set in the present, and set in America. It was great to see a series where they didn\\'t have guns to solve their problems, and their rural population made zombies a much bigger threat. Not to mention is was scary to have fast zombies instead of the walking dead where they are just kind of an inconvenience. I also really liked that the characters were actually smart. There was a whole episode that didn\\'t have a single zombie in it, it was just them preparing their castle for the attack. The set design, makeup, costumes, hair and cinematography was amazing as well. Really liked this show, looking forward to season two!,What a brilliant story with perfect casting, sound, effect, music and photography.Best Zombie TV-Serie that I\\'ve ever seen.And now, we have to wait for 2nd season.,Kingdom is perfect for viewers who do not like horror. Kingdom offers enough fright for it to be enjoyable yet balances it with storytelling which makes the mixture of this Tv series addictive.,Much better than expected.When most of the zombies film/series can be boring and repetitive, this one was very good from the beginning until the end of the 2nd season.I hope we will get a 3rd season , will watch it.The story and the characters are nice too, it\\'s a must-watch for fans of survival.,Absolutely epic program. This is hands down the best horror series I have watched in the last few years. Great set pieces, editing, atmosphere, characters, narrative & music. This is engaging and chilling at times. Action packed without being cheesy or boring. A+++,What an amazing show Im not a fan of the Zombie genre bc Hollywood made the same mistake everytime and all their shows are literally the same\\r\\nBut this show is was too good\\r\\nCant wait for season 3,I thought I write a review of the show since I was looking forward to the series when it was released. I had finally watched the last episode of Season 1 of the Korean Zombie TV series Kingdom. Episode 1 started very strongly with great cinematography, beautiful sets and costumes, building up a good story followed by episode 2 showing us who the zombies are. From there it just went downhill. Everything then is watered down.**Kingdom - Spoiler alert*\\r\\nThere were lack of character development for most of its main characters. The worst part is that the director failed in the many little detail of the shows. For most parts everyone\\'s costumes look like its always so clean and ironed every time. If it isn\\'t that, the dirt on their clothes and their face look so painted and amateurish. Doona Bae, the star from Sense8 was given a character that constantly look sad and suffering. She is best remembered always out in the field digging for herbs. What a waste of talent. In one scene in Ep 6, the director made her to do an over exaggerate expression when looking for herbs. That just spoiled it for me.In some scenes where they tried to inject humour by the supporting characters but it fell flat and lame. It might work for Korean TV dramas but not for an international audience. The final episode 6 was underwhelming with almost no zombies in sight. You sat through the full episode but no big battle and no clip hanger? What an anti-climate. Some websites review had tried to compare it to Game of Thrones. But it is not.,This is one of my favorite series of all time. Something different and refreshing zombie show that separates itself from every other zombie stories. I loved everything about this awesome drama! Highly recommend!,Kingdom has a great start, awesome cinematography and a story that is ridden with plotholes and logic errors from the beginning to the end.\\r\\nLots of the characters make incomprehensible decisions that seem only to be there to fuel the storyline. And lots of the story seems to be very far-fetched if you think about it. (I don\\'t wanna put spoilers here, but the whole \"who has the right to be king\" storyline is already flawed).\\r\\nAlso lots of scenes are so obscenely dragged out, that I had to fast forward some of them.\\r\\nBut, if you look past these sometimes very obvious mistakes, Kingdom is still an entertaining series, visually great and fun to watch.\\r\\nI just wished it\\'d have made more sense.,This is like one of the best ever zombie apocs EVER! (oh wait...SMALLPOX.... lol)\\r\\nThen after the episode 6 shocker it literally was like WTF moment.\\r\\nThis was crazy, insane and amazing how they set this series up and I\\'m starting to even wonder if they will need help from outside sources (like Japan) to their help/ aid if needed but since this was taken place in a different time era with unexpected turns (not to spoil more) this has got my definite attention and I am impatiently want to see what happens in the next season!!DAMN THIS WAS GOOD,Has to be one of the best series in 2019 by netflix, I know I know its only january just now. But what a beginning to the year. You cannot miss it. Just wrapped up the season its brilliant all the way through. Beautiful costumes, amazing cinematography , brilliant gore, hints of comedy, good balanced action. Not too much of anything and not too little. Great gripping storyline throughout with an amazing lead role.\\r\\nNot a spoiler ***** i died laughing at the head-cuffs scene ***** u\\'ll know when u see it.,One of the larger Korean series, this serial makes you frequented dose of the adrenalin in each ring of his episodes, fighting by swords, guns and bowl in everything the wonderful series,Ohh man...This series is getting better by season to seasons.. What can i say, just watch it and decide. More seasons will come and I am Egarly waiting for them...,Absolutely loved the first series of this. Some politics but otherwise a simple plot and lots of zombies! Second series was more political and disjointed; was pretty dissatisfied with the ending; the ice scene was a bit daft and I\\'m not sure who that actually was at the end! Okay but could be so much better with better writing.,Firstly, I am not a big fan of Zombie flicks, it\\'s always the same - some virus and all plus people surviving and all the director\\'s focus is how people survive the zombie thing.\\r\\nBut man o man! Even though this show is a zombie centered drama, zombies are only one component ( a very valuable one though) of this series. It has an actual story! Brilliant actors, editing is superb and there is not just one wasted/stupid scene in the whole 2 seasons, attention to details, the sets, the costumes, the locations, everything very well thought of. The zombie attacks are scary( and action packed) and you feel claustrophobic and you are always on the edge of the seat - these are not your slow marathon Zombie runners, they are Usian Bolts!All in all I would give it 10 stars, but 10 is perfection, but this show comes pretty close to what it wants to achieve! Dare is say better than The walking dead ? Just because there are no funky super-heroes but just normal people who are as vulnerable as we are ?Go watch it NOW!!,Didnt expect much but was surprised , comming from the dissapoitment that is the walking dead , i assure you that you wont be dissapointed,This is by far one of the best series I have watched on Netflix. I thoroughly enjoyed this from beginning to end. Well done to everyone such a brilliant show!,Finally something nicely done i really enjoied it, good acting reasonable and nice effect .,Overall a good show to watch. Engaging and good acting, good flow of story and great picture quality except one big gaping hole in the story at the end. I usually do not like the story with some illogical plots somewhere.The nurse already found out that the walking-deass do not like water, but at the end, when they ransacked the palace, she did not say anything to the prince when she saw him except to cry like a baby and did not act like someone who was the most knowledgeable one on this decease that was killing everyone. And the prince? While facing the bad queen, acted like he had to request her to step down after he knew what she\\'s been doing with the whole plot?Comon!!,Netflix is getting way better every year just an amazing zombie serie its like game of thrones meet the walking dead,What a stupid plot for the 2nd season. They made the prince so stupid.,I hope Netflix do more Family friendly series that I can enjoy with my family and have a great production.,Overall it\\'s a good one, season 2 was lot better than season 1 in lot of aspects.,Zombie category series.\\r\\nWhat I loved the most is the era in which it was shot.\\r\\nproduction design is fantabulous.\\r\\nCinematography is also good.A must watch series.,So much better than what the UK or the USA can deliver.,It is very important that with horror (or any ambigious plotline) that the pacing is slow and gradual before the story is unleashed to us. However, with season 1, the pace failed to pick up and was slightly underwhelming. With season 2 the pace was hectic and much faster but within shorter episodes. This matched the genre better and led to more action but felt a tad rushed. S1 and S2 bearing just 6ep a piece was less than originally planned. They were both supposed to have 8 episodes and with s2 you can really tell as you can also with the criminal season one ending whcih would have left me irritated had the 2nd not been available.In regards to the plot, questions do have to be asked, the plague seems to vary dependant on our protagonists but everyone has plot armour these days so its the writers jobs to get around this. They do an ok job but i cant help but raise an eyebrow at some of the plot points. Other than this the story is pretty well written. The only other issue i have is that the story becomes too wrapped up in the internal politics and forgets about the zombies running loose in the background.Overall, the series is a breath of fresh air, the time period and location of the zombie outbreak creates a unique environment which is definitely one i found interest in. The characters share a decent range of depth and all contain indivdual motives which is expressed clearly throughout. It is an enjoybale cinematic series and that is why i still rate this show an 8/10 despite the criticsim.,So i already wrote a review but after watching any film/serie i tend to criticise specific details rather than expressing the bigger picture. I will try to quickly summarise \\'Kingdom\\' from season 1 & 2 especially as i realise more international viewers will be interested in Korean cinema following \\'Squid Game\\'.Kingdom begins as an ominous horror and diverges into a political battle for the throne. Although the zombies are prominent in the beginning and end, they do tend to go missing inbetween. Each character has individual motives and all convey very different character tropes, yet some are too cliche and are almost laughable. The story consists of a few twists and turns and contains a strong spine throughout the series. The pacing of the first season is quite slow compared to the exceptionally fast paced second. The overall cinema is great, the practical effects are brilliant and the zombies are terrifying. The environment is unique, being set in a medieval zombie outbreak in Korea, this provides an extra tension as communication and defence is weak.8/10 Worth a watch but nothing groundbreaking.,I\\'m hooked after just the first episode!\\r\\nThis was AWESOME!,If you\\'re a fan of a great story, great acting, amazing landscapes & colour and zombies....what??? Then this is definitely for you! Cant remember the last time a show (probably GOT) got me this hooked this quickly. With only 6 shows in the season & a cliffhanger ending, season 2 needs to come ASAP.,Season 2 is better than s1...\\r\\nLast episode was ultimate,If someone\\'s missing the early seasons of The Walking Dead, this will be a diamond. The story-line is really solid and the pace of the show is amazing.The best thing is, this doesn\\'t have filler episodes and boring rewind scenes. Just try this for 15 minutes, you\\'ll definitely binge watch all the episodes.,I\\'ve been waiting for this series to come out since the start of january, and I\\'ve got to say it has paid off. I think it was George A. Romero, who once said that Horror was a way for him to make a social statement and guess this series somehow delivers that in a great way (in one episode there\\'s a strange- and quite actual- discussion on what to do with the bodies of working and high society people). There\\'s also the long and neverending question between slow and fast zombies. After Train to Busan we got a peek to what South Korea seems to prefer, and I\\'m glad with this, but if you add the fact that these zombies share also some similarities with vampires (the fact that they\\'re scared/damaged by light) it just climb up to other levels of awesomeness. I would like to say that what most attracted me to this series is the fact that the zombie Genre had long been quite unexploited and Kingdom is a rare gem because not only it\\'s an era drama/horror series but also all the things I\\'ve stated before. I see it as a genre disruption (which for me is a good thing).,I went into this show expecting a normal zombie movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The zombies and sfx are AMAZING, and the characters are all portrayed very well. The plot is really well paced in my opinion, and each episode leads to new insights on the politics and plague.This is definitely the best zombie show I have ever watched. It is so unique, especially with its Joseon Era setting.Moreover, I am usually not a fan of political drama, but the political drama in this show is really well done! There is a perfect mix of zombies and politics. Definitely the coolest thing ever. It\\'s an overall really badass show! I highly highly recommend.,Slow build but totally worth it. Just becoming more and more epic. Like no zombie show/movie I\\'ve seen before.,Reading reviews it seems to be a love it or hate it series. Definitely not deserving of 1 star votes but not flawless. Seems like people are exaggerating on both scores.Back to my personal opinion. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I wasn\\'t sure what to expect from it and it definitely surpassed my expectations. I\\'m normally not the biggest fan of zombie movies; they\\'re done to death and usually follow the same trend line. That or you never feel like the main characters will ever get touched or hurt. To an extent this is the case with this series, we never really expect the Prince to turn into a zombie early on. But others around are less indispensable.To the series as a whole. Not knowing much about Korean culture it feels authentic enough. With outfits, buildings, customs etc. The storyline feels plausible and with the weaponry the spread of \"disease\" has more credibility. Something lacking in most modern takes on zombies. The storyline can be slow at times but overall it has a strong thread whilst jumping to different areas of the country to forward the plot.However, it\\'s not without flaws. The actions of some people are slightly comical and there is definitely a lot of overacting going on. It does slightly undermine the feel at times.But as a whole, highly recommended and enjoyable series. Well worth watching if you enjoy zombies or aren\\'t usually a fan.,After watching both seasons 1 & 2. Hoping to get the new season.. Sooner.... Can\\'t wait..Brilliant, breath taking, superb story.. From A to Z.. KINGDOM is a must watch...!!,After wasting 10 years of my life on the walking dead only to give up before I got to the end I realised after watching this what a proper missed opportunity it was.This has action, mood, atmosphere, scares and horror which justify its rating, a must for all horror fans, watch and be enthralled.,Season 1 was a blast 10/10What\\'s my verdict after watching the second season? It\\'s as good as the first one with one minor flaw- the ending could\\'ve been much intriguing even if they had a season three on mind. Other that it deserves 10/10 again.,I came into this not expecting much. I didn\\'t even think that I would make it through the first episode. It kept me watching. The more I watched the more I became addicted. Great zombie movie. I\\'m getting so tired of our (USA) versions. It\\'s always the same here, great job!,I have some issues with this, but overall I really like it - it just keeps moving. The short run length of 6 episode for the first series is a breath of fresh air after drawn out shows like the marvel ones and umbrella academy.This was obvious in the second episode when our \"heroes\" needed to find someone and they were in the Frozen Valley - as soon as I heard that, I was prepared for a long drawn out journey to said Frozen Valley - but no - they were there in the next scene! This is very jarring compared to a US show that can draw out any event over several years, so it was refreshing to see a plot move along at pace.On the downside, I don\\'t like my zombies to only come out at night and move quickly - the scary thing about zombies is while one is easily despatched through decapitation, they just keep coming and you are overwhelmed by slow moving numbers.,Great story line. Serious and funny.\\r\\nThis show is definitely packed full of suspense too.\\r\\nScenes are delivered perfectly to get your heart racing, and then at the very last minute you get your relief. There\\'s plenty of gore and blood which is not overly done and more realistic.\\r\\nI love how the zombies are fast too.\\r\\nThese are all good zombie show/movie qualities in my book, and we unfortunately don\\'t get a lot these nowadays. Zombie stuff is my jam and I wish there was much much more coming out. Hint hint.\\r\\nIn any case, A must watch!,Just finished season 2 (credits rolling as I type), and I\\'m gutted it\\'s ended. Binge-watched the last 3 episodes and the finale is one of the most gripping, tense and frustrating ever! Great acting, action and intrigue from S1 Ep2 right through to S2 Ep3, there just HAS to be a 3rd series!,Just amazing.. best zombie series in a long time. Watched season 1 and 2 in 1 weekend non-stop. It\\'s not boring and goood pace. Story is acceptable and logical. Season 3 will be amazing. Cant wait for it. True Gem and a must match.,Character development? Plot? Music? Action? Drama? What ever the question is, it is insanely good. In comparison, The Walking Dead TV series does not even came close to Kingdom. It was super good, i cannot express myself more. Insanely good.,Whoa!what a series.Thank you Netflix for this amazing series.Hope s3 continues....,The idea of zombies in medieval times was not that appealing to me at first, but ended up being a perfect combination of political strategy and action. Great acting. This is one of the examples why Netflix is worth it.,Having never watched any Asian production I stumbled on this show late at night and I was immediately hooked ! Loving the history and story behind it and it kept me edge if my seat.Do not miss this show !,I wasn\\'t expecting much from a show I never seen anything abour nor any of my friends talking about but I was pleasantly surprised. The story is good, the characters are likeable, and the locations of the filming are something to look at. The only complaint I have is when I got to the end of episode 6, I came to the realization that this was the last episode I get to watch for now. With some quick searching my hopes were not crushed and I will get to enjoy a season 2 in the near future.,Even if you don\\'t call it Zombies, that\\'s what they are, and the best way to explain the spread of the desease is with a virus.First it was a plant that you had to smash and put in with the help of a needle. Then it was something you can get after eating perfectly well cooked human meat. Then it was warms, you eat the eggs and they grow inside of your body. Warms that live inside the body, but drawn when you are below water... what a complete nonsense.First season was slow but quite ok, second season was really bad, I am not watching the third one.,They have done a good job with this serie. The story and the setting is very good.Now lets hope that Netflix will not cancel this like most of there series.,If you remotely like East Asian productions in general and Korean ones in particular and are a fan of the horror and zombie genre as well, this one is for you and not to miss. Add to that a historical setting with many subplots and subtext, and you get an idea of what kind of complete package this series is.\\r\\nThe only bad thing I could say about it is, that it ended after just six episodes and only half the answers were given with me wanting to get more of that show.\\r\\nStrongly recommended.,I am big fan of zombie movies and to TheWalkingDead was the peak of zombie movies. But now Kingdom delivers bloodshed, paranoia and mystery which is similar in TWD season1.9/10,This is a phenomenal show. I was bored and was looking for a show to hook into when i found this and boy isn\\'t this a fun show. Although it is a zombie show it has more to it, from character arcs to politics to action to emotions it has everything, hell! it\\'s even funny at times, the production is top notch, acting is even better, directing drives the story at the right pace, i would definitely recommend this, can\\'t wait for the second season,Such a brilliant 1 season an then other mind blowing season and now I\\'m already looking forward to third season. Season 2 is fast paced and you\\'ll finish the whole show in one go. Now as the virus is making us sit at home. This is perfect show to pass your time.,This series is amazing. The stories are well told and the action is non stop. Both seasons left us wanting more with awesome cliffhangers. I\\'m waiting hopefully for a 3rd season.,Nothing much new to add comments wise but wanted to rate and leave a review because it\\'s so good. Fantastic Korean zombie/dynasty drama. For me Walking Dead meets Game of Thrones. Cannot wait for a 3rd series and finally getting round to watching Kingdom: Ashin of the North to keep me going. May rewatch 1 & 2 in the meantime.,I\\'m not big on giving full 10/10 to anything, because I always believe in room for improvement. So we finally get a k-drama, samurai\\'s, and zombies all packed into a nice 6 episode season. I loved the show from start to finish. It had a few slow parts, but honestly they spent good time building up characters which I liked. When crap hits the fan; it gets fun. Just the way papa likes it. rofl. They added a really nice twist to zombies in this series as well. I\\'m a fan for adding your own ideas and flare to how a zombie should act, but I had one hell of a grin on my face when.......oh, I guess you should watch the season finale and see what I was going to say?!The 1 and 2 star reviews don\\'t seem to be zombie fans. They should go back and watch the movie Titanic or something. Leave this genre to the adults that like heads flying off and arms being eaten. Thanks and have a nice day.,This is how a zombie movie is done!!! I was so engaged while watching this. It really is a must see.,What a great series even though I am not a fan of subtitles I could not wait until the next episode. This is cerntialy a must see. Can be a bit gory at times. I cannot wait until the next season is out.,This series is so amazing, it\\'s well shot, scripted and everything just seems well thought out and makes you want more as each episode gets better. Can\\'t wait for the next season. Please don\\'t judge a book by it\\'s title and just watch it! You won\\'t regret it. Never thought I\\'d like a zombie series so much. It\\'s way better than Hollywood zombies. 10/10 recommend!!,I don\\'t hand out 10s lightly (the last one was 4 years ago for The Expanse); after a second watch - yes, it is that good - I am confident to say that this is as good as it gets. Every other Netflix show take note, this is the show to beat and the task will be impossible considering the average quality of Netflix shows.Everything is absolutely stunning, from the acting to the wardrobe to the atmosphere; wow. I don\\'t think it\\'s possible to overstate how fantastic this first season is.Watch this if you love good television.Don\\'t watch this if you can\\'t read subtitles and think good television is \"reality\" TV or cringey shows (eg. The Flash).,Wow. Just wow. This is your typical Korean drama done exactly the same as all the other Korean dramas with a lot of the same actors/actresses you\\'d normally see except with zombies. A LOT of zombies. Very hungry fast moving pissed off zombies. What makes this show unique and possibly one of the best zombie shows I\\'ve ever seen is not just the superb acting, but the complexity of the show. There\\'s political and economical problems going on along with their undead problem. After the season ends you\\'re sitting there wanting more and absolutely loving some of the actors/actresses.,Nearly everyone, including the main protagonist, are incredible stupid. Most of their decisions make no sense, even though the writer seemed to have the intention to have them look heroic. I don\\'t want to go into any details, because i don\\'t want to spoil anything.\\r\\nSome of the characters are intentional stupid, probably to add some humor ... it failed. To give general examples, the protagonists just stand there when something is happening, watching, watching, until it\\'s nearly too late, then they act. This happens not once, but everytime something happens. The main protagonist is supposed to be a crown prince and has some fighting skills and can write, but he has no clue of leadership, strategy or whatever, even though the series makes us believe he was raised as a prince. A lot of people die or get infected because of their stupidity.\\r\\nEverything is just duct-taped to rise tention.When you shut off your brain, the series may be fun to watch. The acting is acceptable and sometimes even good, the cinematography is enjoyable and the action scenes are well made. Therefore not all is bad.Alltogether this series is highly overrated and there are tons of (korean) series that are way better.,Watched the entire series in 2 nights, and with no expectations. I just watched the trailer.I couldn\\'t honestly believe how good this show is, was totally hooked and obsessed after 20 minutes of it staring and couldn\\'t stop watching it.Can not wait for the second series to start in March,Love Zombie movies, but was not expecting Revolution/War/Palace intrigue. All done at a high level. One of the best shows I\\'ve seen in years. Fantastic, binge worthy Netflix at its best.,Kingdom is one of those rare zombie gems you dont find often.,Direction was brilliant, all the characters are done their job well excellent acting from lead role. Don\\'t miss this great one. It is far more better than game of thrones and money heist as all are trending these 2 shows.,I struggled to figure out how to rate it, was the story is very much mediocre for the Zombie genre, but then i remembered that WWZ has a 7 and this is better than world war Z by miles. It had an interesting premise, and a lot of space to explore all kinds of problems and situations in a post war ravaged country, plagued by an outbreak of zombies, unfortunately in the end it doesnt really feel like it really dives into any of them. It acts as if it doesnt have time.Its beautiful, the shots, costumes, scenery, is gorgeous. The acting is fine, even tho theres some aestetic/mood choices being made that make it feel a bit wonky sometimes.This series has 0 faith in their audience, and things will be repeated and explained to you directly, just in case someone doesnt get it. So If you watch movies often and are paying attention, you will catch yourself rolling your eyes, or wishing they would just move along.Season 2 feels very messy, especially with pacing. It very much feels like they were debating how much time they have to wrap up the story during the entire season, so some things feel rushed and some dragged out for no reason.I will watch season 3 if it comes out. Even with all of its flaws its entertaining enough, and the extra time devoted to figuring out how this plague works, how it came to be etc. Is honestly interesting, and it will be interesting how they explain it further. I wonder where they will go with this. The cast is interesting enough and it just keeps moving, showing you more of this world and this disease.Spoilers ahead:This series has very little tension, even if you care for the characters, you are very much aware that no one on the main cast will die, and just waiting to see what red shirt will fall. You can still have a lot of fun by having the characters do something creative or interesting to get out of the situation but they usually dont (props to the flaming robe to get through the zombies tho). It very much thinks its suspensful, you will get shots that should be cliff hangers or get you concerned, but really if youre paying attention you know where they are going. Again if youre naive enough you might believe they are in danger all the time, but if you know you know. :)The zombie rules are inconsistent. One minute they are mindless beasts yeeting themselves into spikes or whatever is in their way to get to the humans and the next they shy away from fire and water and stand around like good little zombies. They are said to be hungry for human flesh but they dont really eat anyone, they just kinda munch on them and then leave to hunt someone else. The sunlight/temperature thing doesnt seem to make much sense. I wont go that much into it, since season 2 tells us there seems to be much more to how this works than what we and the characters thought, so im giving them a fair shake that they might explain it better later on. I personally liked the idea of \\'\\'when winter ends and spring comes this will all be over\\'\\', only to have them slowly understand that this something that is now permanently in the world, and will require a lot from everyone. At least I hope thats where they are going, and Id personally really like that as a theme for the show.Peoples behaviors arent the brightest from the start but it starts wilding in season 2. Ill just say I could somehow suspend my disbelief for the Queens storyline, but when we got to our main cast and palace guards slicing their palms to get attention from the zombies, when literally in season 1 they used the same strategy except they had the brains to slice their forearms, you know in case they actually need to use their hands to handle weapons and such, they seem to have 0 problem with these cuts when they fight the zombies 5 minutes later. Our prince punching the ice with his bare hands, when he previously used his sword to yeet through a roof is painful to watch.,All time favorite for me😍😍💯💯\\r\\nOne of the best zombie flick. I really loved watching every minute of the show. If you\\'re fan of zombies then must watch for you.😍,Yes, the title is in complete caps lock. In fact, this whole review should\\'ve been. But I digress, this Korean series which now spans 2 seasons is on equal footing as the first seasons of Game of Thrones. The hierarchy in the collectivist culture of feudal Korea is excellently portrayed here, and used as a plot element in order to diversify the cast between good and evil: The need for equal treatment and helping each other or the need for power and being a manipulative totalitarian ruler.The cinematography is amazing with tons of beautiful set pieces and camera trickery, fantastic lighting included.The acting is suberb presented by an all star Korean cast that will suck you in the screen.The production is extremely well done, you feel you are in feudal Korea with special effects to write home about.The direction and story move in a clever way. The pacing is never too slow, the writing never corny and the visual story telling is done at it\\'s best here. It\\'s a true adventure, with unique elements to the zombies that make it original.There are only good things to say about this series. After Parasite the Korean Cinema is booming, and this series continues the trend of delivering quality that many Western production could be jealous of. Go see it now seriously.,Netflix\\'s Kingdom (2019) spent most of the first season\\'s time setting up semi-dystopian world, which was brilliantly played-out by its cinematography and screenplay with some game of thrones undertones.Exhibiting its hierarchical society\\'s problem on health, politics, and poverty in a way that the \"Undead\" became just a complication of their kingdom\\'s failure. Pretty awesome that the head of state was the patient-0 as if an ant queen was killed and we were just watching its colony to collapse.The origin, design, and mechanism of the undead, appeared quite distinctive and iconic among present zombie genre. Thanks to its proper direction each episode reveals something about the undead in a satisfyingly-paced story.The whole season went well with its intense climax per episode, presenting storylines that filled-out my world-setting cravings.,There is a creator, Kim Eun-hee. There is a director, Kim Seong-hun. NOT NETFLIX, ok? Ok.\\r\\nIt is like a dorama that replaced the romance for zombies. I thought it was a bad idea but it was not. And thank to the zombies, I\\'m watching this historical Korean place with my boyfriend.,Firstly I have to say the zombie genre is not a favourite of mine,but the two seasons of this Netflix is just fabulous. Yes some of the acting by the lesser cast is a tad wooden,the main players are spot on. From everything from the myriad storyline to the wonderful visuals it\\'s definitely worth a watch,& as I say I don\\'t like zombie films,but that is only half of the plot lines. It\\'s also about a battle against good leaders against evil leaders. Warning,there\\'s a lot of blood letting involved but surprisingly it doesn\\'t seem gratuitous. The end of series 2 leaves it all open fora series 3,I hope that is in the pipeline,I love Korean movies displayed during the Joseon period and as a thriller fan myself, I binged watched this movie (season 1 and 2) in 2 nights and I must say that it edge if the seat, suspenseful and thrilling movie from beginning to end. I enjoyed it and the characters and director did a wonderful job on this one. I recommend it if you haven\\'t watched it yet.,Good story to go along with some of the most intense, suspenseful zombie action I\\'ve ever seen. So good. Just so, so good.,This Korean series is completely ridiculous. The acting is bad. The dialogue is utter stupid. It seems like most of those Asian series have illogical stories what makes them very unwatchable and frustrating. Only the cinematography is properly executed in this failed Netflix attempt. I can only conclude that the fake high rating reviews are made by payed Netflix trolls.,Echoing the other reviews on here, this drama/horror show/period piece is a magical conglomeration of genres. Great acting by all! The sets are amazing, the makeup for the undead is topnotch, and the social commentary is interesting. AND THE HATS! What a way to learn about a culture through their historic headwear. I am eagerly awaiting season two! Bravo!,One of the best zombie shows I ever seen ! I thought this show is just comedian type from koreans and started the first episode and since then I didn\\'t leave the screen until I finish it, Since netflix play the episodes automatically I didn\\'t notice the show has 6 episodes only I got upset I wanted more fighting zombies with swords and rarely with guns it\\'s super amazing and they run so fast which make it harder to escape and they woke up only after sunset it\\'s the real zombies I\\'m so excited for the next season you will probably hit your head on the wall because of the ending it\\'s will be hard for you to wait and know what happened and how they survived from that attack Korea + Netflix = Gold Work !,I\\'m obsessed with this show!!! Please continue and come out with a season 3 pleeeeeaaaasee. The ending got me struck!,This show has been nothing short of incredible. The parallels to Game of Thrones are there. Palace intrigue. Check. Heroes and bad guys. Check. Army of the dead. Check. Evil queen. Check.\\r\\nNo dragons though.\\r\\nSatisfying ending? Check. In this, not Game of Thrones.,This definitely is a good series to watch if you like crude zombie movies. The series slowly builds up while keep getting better. Even though I understood it with subtitles, it didn\\'t matter much. The story, direction and action are good. It can be ranked somewhere near \"Train to Busan\".,This is the first serie in a long time I felt very obsessed with and I consider this as one of the 💎 you can find on Netflix.This is basically Korean version of the zombie plague in medieval times. I really appreciate the concept and uniqueness of the serie. This zombie theme is different than popular, a little bit overated one. A lot of movies about gut eaters are basically one and the same thing with occasional twists such as extra speed or some sort of inteligence, whatever. This one is different, and I truly recommend this to every zombie fan. Also, the scenerio itself plus the great acting and characters make this serie special. There is just so much effort invested in this production, but I would understand if for some viewer the plot is moving forward too slow. Besides, I have seen already few other productions played by Ju Ji-Hoon and I consider him an very interesting and talented actor.I think the first season was better than the second one, which is focused more on the political aspect of the conflicts between Prince and Cho Hak Joo, which not everyone might enjoy as much as the action from first season. However, both of them are really, really good. I also like how the reality of the poorest and low born looked like at that time, which was really rough. I mean, I\\'m not so sure if it was really that bad, or is it a little bit exaturated but it makes the whole serie so deep and ruthless. There were obviously few things I was not pleased about, mostly in second season which might seems a little bit lost sometimes, and I feel truly disappointed with 2 last episodes. I mean, I can\\'t wait to see the third season but the way they ended up the second one was completely not what I was expected, besides, my second favorite character turned out a traitor and died 😭,I just finished watching season 2 and it is AMAZING, i mean everything, art, style, cinematography, plot, characters... It feels like a mix between Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead (this is much better than TWD btw), i really hope Netflix make a season 3 and dont ruin it with SJW stuff.It\\'s a shame that something so good is so unknown.,Doesn\\'t overdo the zombie shindig. Delicate and precise in the way it\\'s shot. Would recommend.,I wouln\\'t say I\\'m a huge fan of asian movies, but after Train to Busan I had to give chance this korean newcomer. And god almighty, it was definetely one of my decisions in the past months. This is a masterpiece. First of all: evetything is beautiful and authentic. The landscape, the scenery, the costumes are all vibrant and exciting. The acting is nearly flawless, even if the only face I\\'ve seen before is Doona Bae\\'s. It\\'s a bit difficult at the beginning to remember the faces, who\\'s who, where and why but once you\\'re familiar, you\\'ll get permanently hooked.The way they treat the zombie question (how they born, how they act etc.) is refreshing and terrifiying at the same time. Huge ups fro the directing and storytelling, I love how they started the action scenes in small, not even showing what happened, only the aftermath. This made the vievers assume the creators didn\\'t have enough money for large scenes with a lot of extras. But how wrong we were! From the middle of the show it\\'s packed with grandiose and brutal action scenes, with bloody close-ups and horrifíying grand totals.I\\'d recommend it to everyone who loves zombie show, it\\'ll be your new favorite I guarantee!,Drama, horror, comedy, action, adventure, all in one. Trust me, you don\\'t want to miss this. Well done Netflix,I first hesitant to see the movie, because I tought it would be just a political old kingdom movie. But I was wrong, this movie is just breathtaking. I love the story where the Prince has to fight for his position in the Kingdom, but have to defend his people from the plague at the same time.\\r\\nI love all the characters, specially the prince, he grow so much, and become a better person, stronger and wiser man each day. All the people around him are intriguing, and have some mistery behind their character.\\r\\nThe female lead also fascinating, she is the physician. She shows that strong women doesn\\'t always nedd the ability to fight or using weapon to defeat the enemies. She use her knowledge, experience, and her instict to survive.\\r\\nAll I can say that, this by far is the best zombie/ horror movie to date. Love every second of it, and leave me wanting more everytime the episode ended.,It took the first episode into the 2nd to get a feel for it then I fell in love. Great show! Great cast, i like the way it\\'s a zombie flick yet feels different. It has a horror aspect that seems darker than most zombie flicks. Just great sad to figure out I already watched a whole season.,This show is so worth watching, a zombie story with depth!That is something you never get, it has an interesting storyline running all the way through, not about zombies.They are more like a secondary storyline.The zombies are not like you see in most other shows, they are there and they attack but the focus is not on the blood and gore, they are wild people, not slow walking bones.The story is about people doing anything to gain ultimate power.The zombies are referred to as monsters, but truly it is the humans that are far worse.So far the show has been very surprising, there are tender moments,\\r\\ngreat displays of loyalty and revenge, along with espionage and evil doings.The fight scenes are plausable, not the typical Chinese martial arts over the top stuff, no one flying through the sky or running up walls.It is really one of the best zombie based shows I have ever seen, the movie is good too. I hate subtitled material, but I don\\'t mind this at all, it is well worth it. Even if you are fed up of zombie stuff, watch it, as I said it isn\\'t the main focus.So watch it, enjoy some good writing, acting, scenery and special effects.,1 season is very good, and season 2 is politics and almost No monsters and the ending is Just rubbish.,If you like Zombies, this is definitely a must-watch. I watched the whole thing in a day because it\\'s short. However, I took several breaks to text people back or watch Youtube videos. That would not have happened if it had REALLY captured me. I like the idea of Zombies in the Joseon era, the production is great, the cinematography beautiful, the acting good. There were definitely some really suspenseful scenes where I barely dared to breathe. But there was not really anything that touched me.I don\\'t feel like I got to know the characters at all, so I did not get attached to them - not even to the Crown Prince. The only character I enjoyed a bit more was the guard played by Kim Sang Ho, whom I\\'ve adored ever since \"City Hunter\" (2011).Furthermore, I think a better OST would have greatly improved my emotional investment. Am I gonna watch season 2? Yes. But is \"Kingdom\" gonna be on my all-time-favorite Drama list? No.,10 out of 10. The acting is great the storyline even better. The zombies are the best creepiest zombies I\\'ve ever seen! Cant wait for season 3,This series brilliantly combines political intrigue, vampire horror, and Korean history into one tightly woven story. The production value of this series is way above value, and be prepared to become an instant addict of the show.,Intense! intense! intense! everyone should really watch it especially in this pandemic times..,I think the beginning of a new for Korean series\\r\\nHollywood should take notes from this Masterpiece,It\\'s a must much korean thriller drama ..! 6 episodes is not enough though..!!!,You won\\'t stop watching until it ends..! Beautiful story line and production design..!,I didnt know anything about this series when i started watching it. Then i ended up binge watching all 6 episodes at nite!!! I love zombie films n by far this tops them all!!,Another korean masterpiece. Nothing to say more. Just watch,a wonderful thrilling experience ahead.,Yes, just as I said the first season was great, they mix the horror with politics and many clans vying for power.This continues in the 2nd season but the stake got much higher and the story more interesting.\\r\\nSometimes it surpasses any of the Hollywood movies and even in a tv series it was much more enjoyable.,How often do you watch something and there\\'s not one thing you\\'d change? The casting is fantastic. A stellar cast. Nobody is in the wrong role, playing a part above their talents. It\\'s fast paced, but still managed to bring depth to the characters. Kingdom isn\\'t just a zombie series, there\\'s social commentary there, politics. This series needs to win every award going, it really does.I cannot wait for series 3. Just phenomenal.,The best thing bout the series is, it\\'s fucking fantastic!,Just finished Season 2 and absolutely cannot wait for the next one to come out already. No spoilers from me here but I highly recommend this to watch for anyone.,Super intense! This is the best korean zombie drama!! Cant wait for season 3!,👏 I ALWAYS say that koreans are good actors but sheesh their acting gives you goosebumps i loved it so much it\\'s very fast paced which i like in shows cause I hate it when they drag it for so long for no reason but this show I finished this show in 2days because it\\'s that good I just couldn\\'t sleep without thinking about it so I wall like let me just finish it 😁 definitely worth watch loved it veryyyy muchhhh,Good story many well defined characters excellent details in props and sets\\r\\nZombie move that sets the benchmark.,A brilliant Korean series with captivating story telling. If you don\\'t like zombies, just watch this series for the sheer excellence of it. The set, costumes and traditional warcraft are amazing. Korean cinema is going to new heights. Keep up this entertainment.,I finally got to sit down and watch this from start to finish and all I can really say is this shoe is everything walking dead wished it was. Firstly the setting creates a fear of the \"monsters\". No machine guns. No rocket launchers. Just single shot muskets and samurai swords. Every episode has enough wow moments to make you care about the world and is so well filmed and scripted I forgot I was watching a TV show. It\\'s one of the best TV series I have ever seen.,Seriously, it started all so well but nothing in season 2 makes any sense: the main bad guy gets bitten in the face but doesn\\'t turn into a monster unlike all the other zombies. The medicine girl somehow discovers water is the cure but won\\'t tell the king-wannabe when the monsters were spreading inside the palace. Lastly, the king wannabe without knowing the zombies are afraid of water lures all the zombies to the pond. All zombies then went into pause mode to let this gUy break a little hole in the iced pond and the whole pond collapses. You\\'re right. The last part where he gives away his kingdom to the kid, that was the last straw of how bad this series truly is. He believes that a baby can lead the country better than him. I mean, seriously?? This series is so anticlimactic, I\\'m so disappointed. Still giving it a score of 3 for the special effects.,I have seen most of zombie movies/series (as a fan of zombies genre) i even watch those cheap and disappointing shows sometimes i even laugh at them. so far there are only few who made it to my best list.\\r\\nand the \"kingdom is one of them\".tension rising, intense battle, hair rising scenes, preparation/waiting for slaughter horde, no exaggerations! its worth your time watching.i will even pay more dollars just to watch more episodes of this show. hoping they earn more to create more!,Kingdom is one of the best shows I\\'ve ever seen. Fantastic mix of horror, action, drama, and political intrigue. A lot of the camera work is *chef\\'s kiss* magnifique as well. 9/10 check it out if you like being entertained.,The acting is great by everyone. The cinematography is also great. The whole production is great. My only gripe is some of the costumes and perhaps how the zombies behave sometimes. These are very minor issues however.,So this series came as a bit of a surprise for me, but nevertheless, I looked forward to seeing it, and I was not dissapointed. First of all, the production and costume design is beautiful and the cinematography had me happily surprised. Acting and writing were great and overall, this series has very few flaws. As for the story: don\\'t expect a horror series with zombies all over the place, but a well thought-out, not too complex historical drama which the zombies are just an aspect of. And believe me when I tell you: after finishing it, you\\'ll want to see more.,This show is gripping right from the beginning, like game of thrones meet zombies, I love it!,This series is really well done very gripping from the get go and has you binging the series in a weekend, although i thoroughly enjoyed the first season and the most part of the second season, i think they should have stayed with only two seasons as it feels like it would be dragging it out by making another one,This is a show that takes place hundreds of years back during the time of dynasties set in Korea amd id spoil it if i said much but it takes a very intresting twist on the genre of zombies! Awesome tense show that doesnt hold back on shock factor i love it! Also check out the film Train to Busan though very different setting ots a great film.,Very well directed and lovely piece of work\\r\\nActing was superb,Great characters, intrigue and cinematography. Can\\'t wait for the next season.,Political intrigue, likeable characters, exquisite costume design, action, horror, and comedy... port everything you understand about the multi layers of great Korian cinema and apply it to a TV show. The size and scale of this production is unlike anything I have ever seen for TV save for Game of Thrones and or Vikings. This show is the walking dead we deserve. I highly recommend anyone to at least give it a try.,Do we need more Zombies on TV? On this showing, yes we do. Great acting, clever plot, beautiful scenery, and when darkness comes, genuinley scary. Watch, and enjoy.,If you liked any of those shows above, then this show is them put together. This is a must watch!!,This one is like a zombie apocalypse meets kung fu meets some kind of classical tragedy. The zombie thing provides some excitement. If felt I was watching an old school kung fu flick complete with overacting and an old world exemplary benevolence vs evil incarnate. This always puts the lead characters in endless tragic circumstances. Not my taste but clearly a the ratings show a lot of people like this kind of stuff.,To those of you saying this is not better than walking dead and bleh bleh\\r\\nStop comparing you will never enjoy good dramas if you keep doing that.\\r\\nFor people complaining this had lot of bloodshed and unnecessary funny moments - you guys have to watch something else it\\'s definitely not for you.\\r\\nPeople saying that lot of Koreans are giving fake 10/10 reviews 😂 Thats funny because I really enjoyed this show. I\\'m not from Korean but I do have a thing for Korean Periodic dramas.\\r\\nSince I\\'ve watched a lot of periodic dramas I\\'ve compared it a lil with them but I still say this one is on top of my list\\r\\nThe costumes are so beautiful.\\r\\nI loved this drama for various reasons\\r\\nAlthough the pace was slow initially it went according to the plot and everything was so perfect till the end.\\r\\nAll the actors from veterans to kids to the protogonists did their part well.\\r\\nI can\\'t stop admiring Ji Hoon- he\\'s incredible from the start till the end. I like the way they portrayed his character development throught these six episodes from being a coward to being a leader, crown prince people root for.\\r\\nSecondly Bae Doona and Seung Ryong - there\\'s no doubt these two would be great by default just doing their thing.\\r\\nThe direction, cinematography, the script - every element is so strong and you\\'ll start developing feelings for these characters.\\r\\nYou feel like you\\'re a part of this show\\r\\n*I guess I\\'m exaggerating*\\r\\nAlso the ending makes us realise that this is just a start.\\r\\nNormally I\\'d predict everything that would happen but here I barely had time to even think of that ending.\\r\\nI never really write reviews but few stupid reviews triggered me\\r\\nFrom episode 1-6 you\\'ll stay put in the same place and you won\\'t get up untill you\\'ve watched till the episode 6.This happend to me!!!\\r\\n* also get ready to die out of curiosity because season 2 won\\'t be coming out any time soon*\\r\\nI do understand that this drama is not for everyone watch it only of you\\'ll accept their traditional aspects and only if you like zombie genre.,I had great experience to loving this show is amazing. there is no moment in it your felt like interest is gone. it full of entertainment, intersting things,curosity. i really apprreciated those all actors who play the role of very intersting way. it looks like has been real in life. i am so greatful to see it.,It keeps you going, that\\'s for sure!\\r\\nWish all seasons are all there. Can\\'t wait to season 2.\\r\\nFantastic plot and story beautifully done!,Zombies are secondary, Political Twists are primary, A must watch, this series will bind you from first episode of season 1, will never let you go away until final episode of season 2, Full Political Horror.,This show blew my mind. Every episode is intense and wasted no time on unnecessary drama. The actings, customs and settings are done exceptionally well.,Best zoombie show i had ever seen\\r\\nyou can find anything in this series\\r\\nhorror, suspense, thriller, drama, action etc\\r\\none word ALL IN ONE,This is one of the most unique, beautiful, terrifying, and fun experiences I\\'ve had while watching something on TV. Truly a masterpiece,The way it has been portrayed is damn good, better than so many Hollywood movies and the characters are doing only what they must do they don\\'t act boring and the twists binds the story to it\\'s viewers.They\\'ve even maintained decency by not adding unwanted scenes that cannot be suited for kids.So it\\'s a great series if you\\'re looking for a zombie or a thriller series.Must watch.,As I accepted Koreans directors have a great sense in zombie series aur movies nobody can match their level in making of zombies genre this series was much more than I accepted from it.,I don\\'t watch Korean dramas but I do love the horror genre. After a friend recommended this to me, I decided to give it a go. First episode was a little slow but essential as they need to introduce the characters. It gets better as I continue watching the subsequent ones. The props, costumes are all very detailed. I\\'ve just finished season 1 with a twist that I didn\\'t see coming. Gonna start season 2 tonight. Can\\'t wait for season 3 in July.,It\\'s hardly a secret that the zombie genre is a dried out well proven by western releases fighting to be the most boring and generic junk out there. Then to my pleasant surprise South Korea dishes up a series set in a Korean dynastic kingdom in 1897 where a crown prince tries to save his land from the horror. And it does it well. Good acting, believable costumes, lovely cinematic and the monsters blends into a wonderful time that makes this series worth your time. One more thing VFX could be done Better if they Want to.,The plot is so unpredictable and nice... the characters are so smart to solve the problem with the sciences so the whole story makes sense and worth to watch.,Did not expect much but season 1 kept us going and we felt well entertained. The ending of season 1 was a huge cliffhanger, something I don\\'t like.\\r\\nAnd then.. season 2 started. And it felt like a turbo boost and the series went from \"nice!\" to \"woah!\"Unique setting, intrigues, slashing, drama. Everything is in it and it felt SO much better and more energized then the (these days and imho) shallow TWD.Can\\'t wait for more!,This one is a must see. Everything about this is much better than usual Hollywood crap, the atmosphere, costimography, story, acting... I really enjoyed watching a tv show that doesnt contain the usual dose of forced special effects, forced audio buildups, stupid drama...this one is just awesome, love it!,As my title suggested I am amazed at the successful combination of different genres so to speak. It was a really fresh idea to place zombies during the Korean middle ages(Joseon era) a direct contrast to most zombie films we see today, located at the modern urban landscape. The decision to do that breaths new life to the so far tired zombie genre.Moreover, what I found incredibly interesting is the \"subtle\" commentary on the extremely hierarchical korean society, which is the actual disease that has consumed the nation. Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient 0) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.Btw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!In terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning! Amazing cinematography, directing, costumes, locations, action scenes, it is truly impecable.What I would like to see is stronger female characters as the series is very male dominated.Good job to everyone involved and can\\'t wait for the second season!!,Koreans are really did it with the netflix . I am the one of the zombie apocalypse lovers and last few years this kind of genre didn\\'t go well of course . But the Kingdom did it to the next level with the really good atmosphere and late of 1800\\'s Korea + Race for the throne will make it sooo dramatic . Don\\'t be bother try it .,Probably The best Production of all Asian TV series. amazing grading, perfect angels, beautiful settings. It remind me of Game of Thrones, very similar feeling. The main character is killing White walkers(here are the zombies), finding the night king (here is the dead king), then going after Cerci (the queen).S1E01 is very slowly building up the vibe and story. It brought my interest, but after the speed is going faster and faster. Many things didn\\'t explain properly. S2 things going out of control, storyline going way too fast. Stories becoming ridiculous. Important people die way too easy. The last episode was very disappointing. It ruined the entire show. They could have done better with such great production, what a pity!,This is a brilliant piece of TV, well done Netflix! I only hope that theres much more of this commissioned.,Story casting shhoting technique casting costumes 10 out of 10,This series shows how good of writers (and of course, actors) for a series. Every details are well connected and reasonable. The speed of the series are fast so you will enjoy every moment of it. They, Korean film crews and Netflix, did it again. Very enjoyable.,As many others, I too waited in anticipation for Season 2, and boy did it deliver! Season 2 has all the good things from Season 1 - the super powerful Dowager Empress, Doona Bae\\'s versatility, all the politics of governing an ancient Kingdom. With all these Season 2 brings MORE zombie action, more fight-scenes, more of Doona Bae\\'s propensity to seemingly take central role in whatever production she stars in, and more drama generally. Season 2 appears polished, refined and the production team sure knew what the audience wanted, and how to give it to them. The cast and acting is amazing, the cinematography and use of landscapes is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing. And for once, the zombies are actually terrifying!,A zombie series with high budget?? Those swords slashing through zombies look so realistic! All the zombie really looked like zombies??! Not just cheap make-up like most other zombie series or movies. Zombies who can really chase you for your blood?? Finally a story where its not an apocalypse. I certainly loved it.,Thank you for this series it was an amazing experience to watch it! Well done,Pls tell me this series is coming back for season 3 and so on! Special effects acting and story all blends in perfectly! Im a big zombie movie fanatic and this hit the spot! Havent seen a good zombie series/movie in like forever...Need more of this!,Ive watched season 1 &2 multiple times! Waiting anxiously for season3... If netflix doesn\\'t sign them up for season 3 I may just cancel my subscription.,I really love this drama. Acting ,storyline, VFX everything is just awesome.,Too many plot holes. The story is too weak. Bad acting. And no substance. Zombie mechanics are so confusing... sometimes they die sometimes they won\\'t.,Powerfull 10/10 You Should Watch Once In Your Life .Bow Down To Directors & Actors🌪,Best zombie tv series ever, great pace keeps you hooked, forget the walking dead, this show is astonishing !!!!,Characters are well-played\\r\\nEffects are beyond imagination.\\r\\nLead lead actors and actresses are very effective in drama.\\r\\nCinematography is excellent.\\r\\nAll plot is heart pounding and exciting! I am so thrilled.\\r\\nI had already finished the 6 episodes without break! This is so called addiction at its finest!10/10 - I would say this series is a combination of, \" Train to Busan, Walking Dead, Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo, Warm Bodies and World War Z!Thanks to Netflix for this wonderful and incredible series. Looking forward to season 2.,Either you\\'re into K-Pop or not, you must watch this series. A basic theme about royal\\'s life and intrigues from powerful people that are wrapped with Korean\\'s great history and their moral values. The writer itself known as one of Korea\\'s talented writers, especially for criminal-theme TV drama in Korea; some of her works considered as favorite dramas both in Korea and other countries. I do really appreciate the cinematography: reminds me a lot about Hollywood\\'s war-theme TV series, especially the tone dark that they used (it didn\\'t picture so much \"happy, sunny day\" scene, which made the scary-and-impossible war got stronger). I enjoyed so much its storyline, even though in some minor parts, in my opinion, are too easy to be read or guessed, but it did not matter a lot to the main storyline. In the end, I think their final scene reminds me about something similar in the closing scene of the latest season of GoT: the deads are ready to destroy human presence. I really am looking forward to Season 2.Note: DO NOT WATCH THIS WHILE EATING ANYTHING.,Brilliant picture, wonderful structured storyline. So refreshing. The first korean production that was brought to my attention and I loved everything about it.,I sat down to only watch 1 episode as it looked entertaining, and the next thing I know I have binge watched the entire 1st season. I enjoy a zombie movie but only if its made well and VERY rarely are they, however this was beyond good. The geographical locations even at their grittiest are beautiful, serene and yet terrifying in the knowledge of what is right around the corner hidden away. The plot is superb and brings the whole season to a finger gripping on the edge of your seat, breathless ending...where your wondering?? Is Netflix bringing this series back? I hope so, for an enthusiast who loves this type of film, series..this is top notch and deserves to be delved into deeper! If I had more than 2 thumbs they would all be up!,Loved it. It kept me guessing and there was not a single moment where I thought to myself \"eh, wonder if I can find something better\", which is saying a lot for my ADHD viewing style. I love the time and place it is set in. There is a lot to like here. I am excited for season 2 and hope it holds up to season 1,This show is great - shot with the highest production values and acted pretty perfectly. Add to that not only the period drama which is well done and of course the zombie scenario and if this sounds appealing to you you\\'ll be in heaven. If none of that appeals to you then I don\\'t know why you\\'d be on IMDb!,What a nice series clean no sex no nude great storyThats how to make a showRomanticHorrorActionHistoricalZombies,Great acting, script and cinematography. It\\'s not a secret that zombie stories are all dried out, however, this Korean thriller is amazing! Original and interesting story, I love how they blended zombies and the joseon era.,I love a good zombie flick and this series exceeded my expectations. I didn\\'t think it was going to be so great! The storyline was so much deeper than your average zombie outbreak. I\\'m patiently waiting for season 2!!!,A zombie series worth commenting on, let\\'s get started! At first I really did had to psych myself out to watch it I\\'m not a big fan of voice over I rather read the subtitles but this is decent voice over work, nicely done. Next the story line is simply.. amazing plot with actual origins of the outbreak not some chemical warfare. Martial arts with gore and sword fights, just couldn\\'t ask for more; zombies that keep on coming never slowing down. I\\'m going to stop it here but please watch the series and be amazed,The mix of zombie and Korean jaseon period after the invasion of Japan is just so unique and different from the modern clique zombie movies. Everyone should watch this! Great story,This series is great although, the one negative is the English dubbing / translations. I am confident that the Korean version isn\\'t as silly or infantile as the translations would have you believe. In fact, the story and acting are enough to help you overlook the Anglo-slaughter of the dubbed version. I liked Ju Ji-Hoon\\'s performance so much I googled him to see what else he was in so I could check them out.The reason for 7/10 is because there are a few moments throughout the seasons where the characters would have to be willingly stupid in order to not draw a straight line between what they\\'ve learned and uncovering secrets. I don\\'t think a person of average intelligence wouldn\\'t clue in to some things that characters in the show seem baffled by; again, this could be simply the result of poor translation, but that\\'s the experience I had so it was hard not to be influenced by it.All in all, I am hopeful for future seasons and to see what happens to the Kingdom going forward.,This is best zombie show is k drama history.i its so fantastic.and more cool.i waiting this for s3,Deserves more Public attention...most underrated show till now...must watch if you are into horror and story...the cinematography is top notch, finely directed and well castes.,Storyline is awesome. Acting is best. If you are a fan Game of thrones then Definitely go for it,South korea u are amazing 🇰🇷 ..WOW ...... i mean this wonderful tv series apart from the masterpiece zombie story tells us about the traditional korean culture thier traditional clothing , architect .\\r\\nIt\\'s so entertaining and well done that i wanted to experience that thrill in my life 😂.. it\\'s full of Action , drama , thrill , emotion , wisdom, everything.. it\\'s A dish worth every single penny.. and one thing i want to tell u is that u will get same thrill , emotion and action in every single episode ... This series isn\\'t going to waste ur precious time .🇮🇳👍\\r\\nNote: it\\'s a zombie series so might not want to eat something while watching 😂😂,Its not just good in zombie genre but...but this shows also tell us about politics for throne ....literally I haven\\'t seen this type of content in my entire life. You should also start watching it.....seriously you\\'ll gonna enjoy it.....,OMG this series is everything. It has all elements which is required to make series worth watching. If you are like umm I don\\'t want to read subtitles then buddy you are missing everything. When it come to zombie movies and series Korean have ace it.,So there are alot of Zombie movies and series out there. We already know what potentially the way of dealing with them... alot of Amos, food in the shelves, just make sure not to make alot of noise, hide in the basement or somewhere made of impenetrable steel and you are good to survive.But the question here is ... what if the zombies happen during those age, when we live in bamboo houses where there is no padlocks and can easily shatter?This series, Kingdom gave us this thrill. How the stories build episode by episode and the smart way of attacking each and every problems that comes along the way. Kingdom is a brilliant series.I am personally not a fan of Zombie movie or series, but Kingdom made me wanting for more. Season 2 is Another level of season 1. Didnt disappoint. The way how the writers reveal some of the secrets in every episodes is so amazing...Highly recommended.,Nothing! I didn\\'t regret watching the whole seasons and special episode to be honest. It\\'s worth watching. And if you like zombie tropes series, do not ever miss to watching this.Season 1,\\r\\nPlot: 8.5/10\\r\\nTwists: 8.5/10\\r\\nCharacter: 9/10\\r\\nRating: 9/10Season 2,\\r\\nPlot: 9/10\\r\\nTwists: 10/10\\r\\nCharacter: 10/10\\r\\nRating: 10/10As you can notice, as eps passed, it\\'s getting much better than the previous episodes. The hidden truth will be revealed. The execution of the twist is worth watching. Didn\\'t even regret watching this series. It will raise your standard when it comes to kdrama zombie tropes series.Do not forget to watch the prequel of this series after. It might answer those questions that was unanswered. Thanks you for your hard work for creating this such good series! Salute!,The idea of political intrigue + zombies in feudal Korea sounds interesting. However the characters have no depth, plus the story and the plot holes make you roll your eyes all too often. Often the characters are not driven by their own motivations but the writer just pushes the characters in the plot further, dragging the whole ensemble on a rail. The acting in itself is not terrible but it\\'s hard to deliver a nuanced performance when the characters are so 2 dimensional. Really disappointing. Kudos to the cinematography though.,I waited for a long time for this one and boy it didnt disappoint..great show,I wasn\\'t sure if I would like the show when I first come across it but once I started to watch it I\\'m glad I did. I like how they changed the way they done Zombies and not make them the same way as other tv shows or movies I find they really suit the time period it is set in. I do have one problem with it is that there is only 8 episodes and I watched all of them in a day now I want more. Since the start of the year I\\'ve been finding a couple of shows from Netflix that are good but only have one season in it so far they really need more episodes for all of them,I hate TWD for sure, and i hate zombie movies and stuff.First of all, i want to watch it because it has my bae, ji-hoon. But then, i was captivated by whole script, acting, cinematography, etc.It has brilliant twists and i think the scenario is genius.Love it!,Short review. This is a very well made, mixed genre zombie show that\\'s filled with clever writing, camerawork, and set in an interesting time period. It\\'s funny, it\\'s scary, it\\'s epic..and it\\'s not predictable at all. Watch this show. End of my first review.,Such a great series. Koreans are really good at cliff hangers and I really cant wait for the next season. What\\'s impressive is that it has surpring twists like no other series. It is definitely a must watch!,It\\'s hard to memorize the name at first, so you better write it down on a piece of paper. it has a good concept of zombie apocalypse despite some flaws. the politics resemble of game of thrones. we\\'re rooting for the main character to prevail, and then plot twist. i think it\\'s best if the series ends in season 2, but they make another story of it.,After watch it without read synopsis I\\'m not expecting this series at all but it blow me away after watch it just for 10 minutes,\\r\\nthe cinematography is astonishing and perfect. I have to admit that this kind of setting and cinematography is not tv series class, this have to be high class movie.\\r\\ntrust me, after you watch this for just one episode, you\\'ll agree with me that zombie blockbuster movie hollywood should shame after this series.I like this story more than TWD, the acting, thrilling, horror is more intense in this series and more logical than you think\\r\\nI think this series will change your perspective with korean drama,\\r\\nthis is just to good, cant wait for season 3 got release,Overall it\\'s a worthy binge watching series, it\\'s just that the Prince character you\\'d find is not realistic (you\\'ll know when you hit season 2). The other odd thing is, Seo-bi can avoid the zombies with a single fireball but all the soldiers just died at the end even when they know that the zombies are afraid of fire. Just doesn\\'t make sense to me.,Really thank you netflix! The Best zombie series ive ever seen! Fights, storyline, everything. I just dropped my brain after last 2 episodes.,I\\'m mid-4th episode in and this is easily the best contemporary zombie film I\\'ve ever seen. Love the costumes, the heroes, the machinations in the palace, the zombie chase scenes that have me screaming \"RUN!! RUN!!\" from the sofa...whew! I\\'m not sure we need 6 episodes, but I\\'m waiting eagerly for the villians to get their come-uppance.,What do you expected from a corean historical zombie movie? I don\\'t know, but I was suprised. Six episodes later you will be left alone, with some kind of cliff hanger. But this is fine there is more great thrilling story telling to come. Can\\'t wait!,Great story and much action with a big budget. Season 1 was better and more interesting I would give it a 10/10 but season 2 was still superb but not as good.\\r\\nThe action in the show is really well done and the zombies are very scary looking and extremely convincing. You will start to care about the characters a lot but this was hampered due to waiting for so long for season 2 that you forget the story so everything was way more confusing because they didn\\'t include any recap.\\r\\nI think eason 3 will be the best after that ending I can\\'t wait. Please watch this show its easily the best zombie show ever made. Much better than american,The Kingdom shows us this is the best quality zombie related movie. Scenes, production, screens are awesome! 10/10,I truly can\\'t breathe while watching the last episode, very thrilling and intimidating, please watch it for the good of story and mistery. Gonna update this review after the new season release.,Casually brings the zombie genre back to life. A must see for any one that loves the biters!,... spoiled it for me completely. First episode was promising, the second instantly spoiled it. The sense of humour like in a Jackie Chan movie is a disaster. Sorry. Good idea, but why make a soap out of it??,I need a season 3. I really enjoy this series, can\\'t wait for another one.One of the best zombie I even seen!,\"Kingdom\" is a well done series with characteristically Eastern production. The sets are well made, the scenery is beautiful, the soundtrack is compelling and the action is fierce. The acting, of course, is melodramatic as usual, but while fans of campy Chinese Kung Fu movies (yes, I know this is Korean) will not find anything unusual about grown men behaving like injured, hysterical children in response to any hint of tension, viewers unaccustomed to Eastern melodrama will be repulsed. I like this series because I like Eastern action movies and zombies, but people who do not like either will not like this show. It has plenty of blood and gore so not recommended for young children.,I never write a review in Imdb or other sites but this one wouldn\\'t allow me not to write ... the show is so underrated just because it\\'s Korean .... well about show I can say S1 was good but S2.... wow I mean WOW! it\\'s way better than the 1st one it has more and more surprises especially the 2 last episodes of it ! There are moments that you say okay that\\'s it the show is getting slow and boring and there\\'s no way to escape! But the writer(s) surprise(s) and you are like wowwww! Gosh!My heart\\'s beating my face ! .... overall this Show\\'s definitely watchworthy ❤,Great story - politics, war, relationships, humorCompelling characters - strong femaleSuspenseful and funny scenes, with entertaining dialogue and surprising eventsTRUE horror elements including dread, fear of the unknown, impending doom, truly shocking scary scenes, taboo breaking & gruesome events (like mom zombies & kids). I will leave it to your imagination.Multilayered plot / build up to epic battle of human vs zombies and humans vs humans (political war for control of kingdim)SCARY ZOMBIES - Fast, Gory, IntenseNo one is safe,When you can\\'t tell which season was better then... Waiting for season 3 and hoping they will keep high standards,Great storyline, awesome heroes, terror galore and a bloody gore-fest too. Kingdom is probably been the best thing released on Netflix this year... so far. What begins as a political drama soon turns into a supernatural thriller... in the best way possible. The first episode is a LITTLE bit slow but give it \\'til the end of pilot and you\\'ll be left wanting more. The cinematography is very well done too... if that matters to you, Mr/Miss Reader.,It is like a mix up of game of thrones and waking dead with korean film making..\\r\\nThis is really good series if you want to spend some time without realizing that you are wasting it,An epic historical thriller and a must match Series.\\r\\nAsians have raised the standards quite high.\\r\\nBrilliant acting and wonderful locations. A new fan of the Korean Series. Thanks to all who made this series. Waiting eagerly for the next season.,What a twist in the last episode. The show gets very furious from episode 3.Definitely worth watching.,My expectations is a little bit low before watching this show. Just Zombie show which has no plot and typical violence.\\r\\nBut after watching 2 episodes, I was crazy in this show.\\r\\nRecently I never completed tv show Episode when I started to watch but I finished all 6 episode without any stop.\\r\\nI don\\'t know how I can wait season2.,To be honest I\\'m only at the first episode yet, but this mix of politics, conspiring, twists and zombies is just so entertaining.,This drama had me hooked from beginning to end. like reading a good book. Historical drama meets the walking dead. All the elements I love, little romance, lots of tense and thrilling moments, great characters, immersion in the details of the authentic culture of the era - costumes, food social and economic values, love it, cant wait for season two. Please let it come soon.,The storyline is amazing how the zombies began and how the every one fight for the crown in any way possible,I am so impressed by the intensity of acting in this tale that the zombies are, actually, entertaining. The entire first season kept my interest. I\\'m looking forward to the second season, hoping that the story comes to an equally satisfying end. Thanks, Netflix!,Just wanna note that Kingdom is likely set back somewhere in year 1600, which is right after a 7-year war with Japan. Joseon, the name of Korea at the time, enjoyed 150 years of peace and prosperity but started to disintegrate as power game between political parties became intense and the monarch was losing control. Meanwhile, Japan was at unification and finally launched a surprise attack in 1592, which led to the Imjin war of 7 years btw Korea and Japan. During wartime, the crown prince Gwanghaegun, likely the model of Lee Chang in Kingdom, led civilians and soldiers to battle while his father and royalty fled to north. You will get to know the truth in Season 2, and how the zombies got started, but I won\\'t mention further cuz it\\'d be a spoiler.,Awsm story telling with brilliant action...and also casting was so good... real intense scene with zombie world.,I was very skeptical of this show in the early episodes, even though I have had strong recommendations from my trusted friends to watch this show. While I will say that the ending is a final blow in getting me hooked into this show (to see how season 2 continues this), I can agree that there are elements such as the humor from the aristocrat fools don\\'t really work for me other than that they do in a way continue the plot (thin sheet from they are there for the sake of the plot), however this show unpacks in a way that makes it have great potential. In season 1 currently many things are still astray (just details here and there that are waiting to be used later). I will need to see how season 2 fares before I will gasp the true worth of this show. Right now its a bit on how Game of Thrones should\\'ve dealt with the frost walkers (with their own mix of talent) but ill have to see.,A beautiful, under-appreciated show with wonderful performances, breathtaking photography and a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is a bit of a slow burn at first, but completely worth it.,KINGDOM SEASON 2 VERDICT:\\r\\nDON\\'T WASTE YOUR TIMEWhile season 1 was a great run, many are extremely disappointed with this highly anticipated sequel:\\r\\nterribly slow pace, too much talkingfocused on political power struggle and drama with highly guessable plotswhere the fvck are the zombies????!!!!Looks like another TV series forced to finish deadlines in less than a year. Ended up producing a boring, pseudo-zombie show. Quite a mediocre season at best. Not worth wasting 6 hours of your life. Terrible!To those who\\'ve watched, were there any exciting moments worth remembering at all?,I love the originality of this show! The actors, story line, and settings are pretty great! I especially love Seo Bi, Moo-Young,Prince Cho, and Shin. Even Beom-Pal starts to grow on you as you continuously root for him to become a more courageous person throughout the series. I think season 2 is even better than the first season, and I can\\'t wait to see what season 3 holds. I love this show. Please don\\'t cancel it Netflix! It is just a refreshing, original show. Well one Kingdom.,I\\'m not usually watch Korean movie or tv show but Kingsom is so cool that I have to watch it twice, can\\'t wait for season 2.,Excitement for the series will exponentially increase .,An absolute gem on Netflix.\\r\\nOne of the best thriller web series I have seen. The most unique and creative period shows on offer.,An integrated masterpiece that brings your view back to the works of the zombies again, representing, directing and embodying the story by mixing historical political events with the idea of the zombies, even if it was a date of excellence .. Wonderful work, all we lack is dialogues because the dialogues in it were somewhat superficial.,Hands down the best zombie series out there! From cinematography to setting, plot to battles, political intrigue to twists, costume design to acting, this easily puts all other similar series to shame. The quality of each episode makes you want more and more and you end up binge watching the whole thing like there was no tomorrow. Definitely a must watch and trust me, you\\'ll do it more than once!,This series is very good and very enjoyable. Actors have payed their role very well. Waiting for it\\'s third season. Hope Netflix release it soon.,I didn\\'t find any flaws in this drama. Story line and player acting are neat and classy. I really enjoyed the best zombie show ever. and not only that, in terms of conflict this drama manages to present great greed, cruelty and selfishness. the acting of all the players is very good and heavy. all players get the right portion of duration. the writer and director managed to portray this drama very well. the beauty of this drama managed to be presented beautifully. therefore I dare to give a rating of 10. Recomended!,Simply amazing zombie series .. must watch if you are zombie addict..,Each episode is gripping with a well thought out plot.,I\\'ve been raving about this show to anyone who will listen for a while now! With a winning combination of zombies, politics and period drama, this show feels very fresh and certainly lives up to the hype. Perfectly cast and acted, impeccably produced and with some of the best action scenes in a show for a long while. Definitely one of the best additions to the genre, and well worth adding to your watch list.,I am glad that I came across this series on ! Old traditions, thriller, Politics, Zombies and lot more, must watch series of you are a fan of chinese movie fan...,Everything about this show is brilliant. Like others have said, it seamed strange setting it in this era but my god they got it spot on. The English dubbing is as good as you\\'ll ever get and after the first episode you would almost think it was the original spoken language.\\r\\nThe cinematic experience is on a par with the best of Hollywood when needed, and the attention to detail in the palace\\'s and costumes is second to none.\\r\\nI used to watch the walking dead but the zombies became so slow and boring that I gave up on it. The zombies here are on a par with World War Z and then some, and just to make it more interesting they are also ever so slightly evolving through the show.\\r\\nIn a nutshell... Its one of / if not the best zombie series I\\'ve ever seen and cannot wait for season 3.,Interesting only because of the location and era. Acting is sub par, story is slow. I was so excited for this, but I\\'m disappointed.,To be honest I wasn\\'t sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this but I found what can only be described as a true hidden gem! Excellent writing, acting, cinematography and fight choreography. I can\\'t praise this enough to do justice to just how good it is.,Season 1 was very good but season 2 is great.\\r\\nthe best Zombie i ever seen and the whole story about kingdom and the flower ..i love it.\\r\\nthe cast are incredibly good.,I don\\'t want to discuss the specifics to avoid spoilers, but although it started rather promising in the 1st Season, in the 2nd Season I strongly disliked some of the plot twists, reactions and consequences as the film was evolving. Compassion and everything is pretty nice, but when they appear too contradicting to potential reality it starts feeling too detached and at times even painful to follow. I had to stop myself from fast forwarding some episodes of the 2nd season, and it never happened to me in the 1st season. So yes, this is a bit disappointed, but I still like the show because of the setting and the underlying idea.,I was recommended to watch this just 3 days ago. I finished the entire season by now and can\\'t wait for the 3rd season. The story line, pace, BGM, cinematography, characters and everything else is just awesome. I can only recommend to watch without hesitation. Netflix should produce contents from all over the world like this story line.,I think we should move to watching Korean series, it\\'s my first one and I\\'m highly impressed the way they showcase different genres and stories in a single series. I stopped watching walking dead after fifth season due to the narcissism nature of the lead character RICK but I guess I\\'ve found getter version of walking dead. Give it a try and you will be addicted to it.,Zombies are just a detail of good written deep story.Really a good show, hope there will be 3th season.,After a long and disappointing wait for All Of Us Are Dead, I am so happy to have discovered this show. I love the back story with all its plot twists and turns, and the unique take on zombies. I found it very original and refreshing. There is so much more to the story than the usual zombie attacks in every scene, with their endless bone cracking and growling noises. There were one or two scenes where I found the acting to be a bit overdone and cheesy, but season 2 is phenomenal! I really enjoyed the depth the characters have developed. I would highly recommend Kingdom to anyone who enjoys Korean cinema or zombie movies, but is looking for something more original.,Dubbing was as clean as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, few foreign films seem to get it right; however, the Kingdom did just that.It was a compelling story, the first episode was slow (character building), but when the action starts off it is intense. I was mesmerized by the action, production value of the show, costumes were exquisite, and over all performance of all the actors/actressesThey did an excellent job with character development, I was fully committed to each character and their arc hoping each one would survive.I keep hearing how the zombie franchise is a dried up well; however, for me it isn\\'t dried up, writers are just failing to produce good quality movies/series. (In most categories) The Kingdom is not one of them, they threw some twist I hadn\\'t expected and was extremely pleased with their interpretation of the genre.It is a series I highly recommend,Series that packs a punch with its thrilling plot line supported by amazing cast and direction.,I love everything about it. The story, the plot, the characters and everything. What\\'s not to love?,Late night, around 1AM I was just browsing thru Netflix and came across Kingdom, and I was just like hmm, this looks like a Period Korean Zombie show. I was super excited, once I started watching this, I just couldn\\'t take my eyes off the screen. It\\'s so good, I rewatched all six episodes again! And 6 episodes per season isn\\'t enough!!Season 2 need to come sooner!!! Totallly addicted!Anyone who loves zombie films need to watch this! Enough said, now go watch it!,Good tv show,I hope will be a second season,I really enjoyed. The actors did a good job!!!,I hattte zombie movies but this one was so well done i finished the whole first season in one seating lol!! Cant wait for the second season!!!!!\\r\\nPs. Someone wrote in the rieview tht the movie is too male dominated and would like to see some good female lead actor. If you felt that way than the director did a good job because that is how korea was in the old times. I know it\\'s sad but in the old times in korea, they needed men to support family by farming, fighiting, fishing, etc so males were very precious. Almost to the point where if you have a girl pregnant it was a huge disappointment.,This show is amazing in many ways. It is estetically gorgeus, has got a great plot, good acting, and so on. But most of all, it speaks about our society more than one could believe: it is about migration, about the happy few exploiting a large mass of people in misery and in starvation, leaving them out of their lands again and again, as if they were just garbage. I think this is one of the best zombie thing of the last few years because it talks about now, truly folllowing Romero\\'s path.,Awesome show, very intense and action packed. Characters are great! Defently a must see for zombie fans.,The series is two-level tense and awesome. The story of the crown prince against the usurpers of the throne and his survival while trying to save his people, and the second is the ravaging zombie disease destroying everything in its path. I really like the setting and love the way the disease was introduced. Great show. Looking forward to much more.,Absolutely amazing. I really love all of this show : the Asian culture and history, the zombies and everything related to it. Just to give to the zombie topic a whole new story.,This series reflect the actual autocratic society in which the \"so called\" elite will not only rule over the poor but also exploits their works and life. The kind of horrific plague shown here should occur time and again to remind that all people are equal and should have equal opportunity in the society to fight over hunger, poverty and epidemics.,Oh man! When I started it,I wasn\\'t expecting it to be this good and am so badly looking forward to 2nd season.There is a story and gruesomeness,all in one show.Acting is superb and the gore is awesome.They left us hangin in the air,literally,in the last episode,and if you\\'re reading the comments before starting to watch the show,go ahead,without a second thought.,If u search Like \\'got\\' series this is perfect.in got Dead snow here zombies excellent series.dint Miss.,Excellent take on the zombie outbreak with the explanation of the disease. The show doesn\\'t looses it\\'s intense settings even for a moment. A must watch for everybody!,It\\'s like watching GAME of THRONES and WALKING DEAD at the same time..\\r\\nBinged watch the whole season just for one night and i must say all the scenes were amazing and makes you to look forward,Best series I have ever watched. The action, the cinematography, the acting and of course zombies are the best show in these series. Looking forward to watch the season 3,Completely Better than any horror show out there. Better than resident evil a million times,Great cast. Great acting. Absolutely great cinemathography. The scenario also perfect! The series absolutely worth my time.,Even after reading the many 10/10 reviews here I was not expecting this to be as good as it was. If you (like me) sometimes need a little push to watch non-Hollywood style productions that aren\\'t in english, I can\\'t emphasize enough how much it\\'s worth it here.\\r\\nIncredibly well made series with nothing lacking-to the contrary! I was on the edge of my seat for the entire 1st season and after one episode had completely forgotten that I was reading subtitles. Like another user put it nicely: Take notes Hollywood - this is how it\\'s done.,Every frame in this series is a masterpiece! Loved the plot, story, characters and director\\'s vision. While there is so many zombie based films and shows but this one is definitely the best. It shows a new perspective and a new way to show a zombie story. I hope there is a season three for this show. Can\\'t wait.BTW, I saw the show like 7 times and never bored. Enjoyed every time..,It is a mistake to categorize this as a zombie series. Instead this series is more of a power struggle to capture the throne with the zombie epidemic backdrop. Well done. The Game of Throne, a Korea version.,Wow. What a zombie-thriller series. I can\\'t get out from this \"KINGDOM\". Literally every scene is wow moment . The kingdom crew worked so hard to make this perfect, I can see that. Kudos to the team. Zombie makeup and their performance are just perfect . No words to say , I\\'m impressed. If you like zombie movies , you should definitely check this out , it won\\'t disappoint you. Just give me season 3, I can\\'t wait!!!!!,Such a mindblowing series with a strong sturdy script. More than the zombie things we will be pocessed by the story and the actors. Twist and turns are portrayed in a subtle manner with out loosing the suspense. Actors performance are too great.,Love this zombie flicks from start to finish for every episode. Can\\'t wait for the second season. Bring it on,Inlove zombie movies. and i really enjoyed kingdom becuz its different, and not typical zombie movies. interesting and solid storylines. cant wait for season 2. it better come out soon.,This has to be by far the worst netflix series I\\'ve seen. Some characters act outside logic, the zombies should be called. \"Brainless vampires.\" Because they act like vampires without thought. The zombies go days without eating but still manage to run faster than a normal well fed human, the magistrate has way too much power over the crown prince, and people seem to ignore the main threat at hand. All in all it was extremely boring to watch and i had to skip some scenes because they were unnecessary.,A real treat for zombie fans\\r\\nthe locations are very smartly selected\\r\\nOne of the first shows in zombie genre to take us back to the kings and queens era\\r\\nPlot unfolds in very unique manner which doesn\\'t let us take eyes off the screen even for a second\\r\\nEnd of the Season ends with craving for more like a zombie,The language, the setting, the atmosphere, the plot, the characters, it\\'s all bloody perfect.,Best tv series from korea consist of drama, action, good acting made love with this and final episode suspense. This series feels like you are virtually in the series,I don\\'t normally write reviews on many tv programmes but this show was a must,I have only one word for it tremendous!,Must watch this it is so gripping and the unfolding of some secret are mind blowing.,You will end this drama in one go. Over the night. That is for sure.,Most expensive series. is watching this series more than 10 time.in my choice it\\'s best series of South Korea.love form Bangladesh.thank you netflix,Saw something about this series a while back and was looking forward to seeing it. Have only watched the first 2 episodes so far, but wow, awesome, Can\\'t wait to watch the rest.,It has a slow pace but it still enjoyable to watch. The makeup and the overall CGI/practical effects are pretty good. There was a lot of character building but leaving some mystery to there back story.,The story is a steady mid pace affair with some atypical Eastern archetypes done well with some attention to detail that put it above regular tv viewing. The court intrigues and formalities add tension while the action sequences are well done even if somewhat stereotypical.,Slow pace, to many dialogue, a bad plot story. Just like B rated 90s age movie,On the heels of a myriad of other international series, Kingdom presents yet another hit for Netflix. It\\'s a very unique and satisfying version of the zombie trope that truly immerses the viewer into the onscreen events.,Game of Thrones but with cooler zombies. I really wasn\\'t expecting to like this as much as i did.,Kingdom is a Horror suspense thriller....\\r\\nBut my only concern is about it\\'s episodes..\\r\\nWHY IS IT SOO FEW ONLY \"6\"..!!!!!\\r\\nAt least 10 episodes must be done....\\r\\nThe thing is its not only about the zombie creature\\'s but also about the nation and his crown prince protecting his people and gaining their belief....as HIS CROWN PRINCE,I wish i could put in words and describe how good this show is, literally everything has been managed perfectly, the script is delightful there\\'s 0% percent you could get bored at any moment watching this show the acting is stelar is pure and raw you get to connect with every each oke of the characters of the show and feel just like they, so many emotions for only one show oh and last but not least the camera work deserves all the awards they can get wtffffff im amazed by how good this i just still cannot describe it, this is simply a MASTERPIECE, hands down one the best tv shows I\\'ve ever seen.,The first ancient Korea Zombie Series I HAVE EVER SEEN, and it\\'s pretty nice,Don\\'t let the fact this isn\\'t in English put you off.Visually stunning. Brilliant story, well paced with genuinely \"edge of your seat\" action. in some places.Loved it. More please.,They truely have mastered the zombie genre. As a person who doesn\\'t understand Korean, I still prefer Korean audio with English subtitles rather than dubbed. It just gives the show more character. Now I\\'m exited for the 3rd season and looking forward for \"All of Us Are Dead\" which is also Korean and comes 28th january.,I think the young prince kinda look like character \"RICK\" from series \"the walking dead\". i hope this series won\\'t be boring such twd.,S show is just not a one dimensional zombie show, what\\'s great about this show is it has various aspects and there are things which may come very surprising for you. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if your a fan of thriller shows mixed with political brilliance..,GREAT.I enjoyed the scenes. It feels very good.I feel like I am there I totally get into the scenes.Must Watch.You cannot miss it anyway.I want season 2 ASAP.,I\\'ve been researching movies and their reviews for years on here but never felt inclined to leave a review until now! This movie is awesome! Although I speak English and decided to watch it dubbed rather than read the captions it didn\\'t affect the movie at all. I love zombie shows and I\\'m constantly looking for my next zombie high and this my friends is it! It took until the 3rd episode to pick up speed but once it did it\\'s been amazing! I\\'ve been on the edge of my seat smiling in terror the entire time!! If you have any doubt about watching this please leave the doubt behind and watch it because you will not be disappointed!!,I never writed a review on idbm before. But must write for this movie series, im big fan of horror movie so i dont feel any scary with any zombie movies, just because i watched alot of zombie movies already. But this series is different, very different, feel very dark and scary, humanity is weak to runing and fast spreading virus zombie :)\\r\\nI think:\\r\\nThe walking dead: 8/10\\r\\nFear of the walking dead 5/10\\r\\nZ nation: 4/10\\r\\nThis series: 10/10\\r\\nYou will not be dissapointed.,Best zombie series.I enjoyed every minutes, all episodes are awesome.,First and foremost, Netflix made a groundbreaking with the release of \\'Kingdom\\', being its first Korean drama. I was aghast with the drama from the start of the first season until the end of season 2 final episode. It\\'s an interesting series with great storyline, settings, and characters. It\\'s been a while I watched a series that each episode will tempt me to see the one that follows. That actually happened again at the end of season 2 final episode, revealing more questions born out of curiosity and display of a new mystery character.,Must watch great acting decent stroy plot twists and much much more,Kingdom is worth seeing by generation upon generation...,Wow! The both seasons are kingdom-nastic and kingdomazing...,Omg love it and I hope they do season 3. I keep watching this drama over and again. Trust me I dont like zombie movie but this drama I love the twist and this better than walking dead and znation. Love this please keeping do this I cant wait to see season 3 on Netflix.,Hope to see season 3 ASAP. Season 2 brings hype and excitement to me definitely. This drama is really a bait for drama freak like me. The drama has it moral values and highly recommended,Dear all iMDs ones, believe it\\'s the most very extreme lovable series for the ones who really love horror adventure drama politics with a perfect chemistry. The Walking Dead has its own taste, but it\\'s really so worth watching. Kindly go through its first Two episodes you\\'ll get yourself bonded with it. 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼,I hope there will be a SEASON 3... so many questions to be answered after the last season.... best korean horror tv series of 2019👏👏👏😬,Just crazy good production enjoyed every episode please renew the season. not your typical Hollywood TV show but the did really great on incoporating Asian culture and drama as well as politics,Great mix of Korean medieval drama and a zombie apocalypse. Not gruesome.,This series is one of a kind especially it\\'s a different genre from what we usually watch from Kdrama etc. My patience was worth it. Every episode gives you chills. Damn. I rarely finished those Kdrama, but this series makes me want to keep watching and anticipating for the next Season. I truly RECOMMEND KINGDOMS for you to watch. Though season 2 is out, now I have to wait for the next season again. T.T,This web show was the best ever show I have watched in my whole life....It keeps you hooked up in its all 12 eps.....Do check it out if you haven\\'t yet, you\\'ll not regret it !!,The best zombie series I have ever seen. I have rewatched it few times and everytime I appreciate more the cinematography. Everything is beautiful. Stories are excellent. As an Asian, I can strongly relate to the culture and its norms. What I like more from the Season 2 is the comic/manga-like vibe in the finale battle.\\r\\nI really wish this series will have more seasons to come to satisfy the viewers. Amazing job for the creators, creative persons, casts, crews, and everyone involved. 10/10 highly recommend,Great story, great acting, drama, thriller, twists, action, its all there and its done wonderfully.,I would give it 10 scores but I just hate the ending of S2. I really wish this just end with Cho being the king and the baby is sent back to his mother, and just say \"the queen is dead with her baby due to monster attack\". No people like and trust the kingdom anyway, but they put respect to Cho because he is different than the rest of corrupt governor.,I myself am not the biggest fan of zombie apocalypse type movies due to the constant theme of America gotta save the day ECT and how they are all based in modern days however I love that kingdom is set during mediaeval Korea wich opens up a hole new type of horror and gives an almost realistic view on how people hundreds of years ago would have responded to a plauge obviously being oblivious to what it is, another aspect that I love was the way they how they executed what could be seen as cliche but instead actually gave a reason behind why it is over all probably my favourite TV show ever.,I\\'m in awe... this has to be the best series of all time!,If it was just a zombie story it would be trite and monotonous but they give full focus on the characters and the constant sinister political scheming going on for grabbing power.The character of the crown prince is very well written. He is privileged but did not have a flowery and easy childhood. He is charismatic, empathetic towards the common people and benevolent diverging from the normal trope of evil incompetent crown princes. Lord Cho is in direct contrast an aged man who has already accomplished alot, commands loyalty of the army and will design the most sinister and insidious plots to destory him mercilessly. The central conflict between these two is very well written. The death of Lord Cho was poetic justice, a man who thrived on swallowing and back stabbing others was swallowed by her own snake of a daughter.The plot doesn\\'t make the victory easy for the crown prince which I greatly appreciated, the advantage and events sometimes start favouring him but then the quickly shift to favour Lord Cho.The production design is lush and central performances are great, cinematography and many of the shots are stylish, the score is fitting. Visually and Score wise too it is well done.The ending was bit flawed though the prince should have become the King, I know it is trying to show that he is unlike the rest who don\\'t value others life but he didn\\'t have to kill the baby just return the baby to the original mother and reveal to everyone that he is not actually the deceased King\\'s son, you have the medical expert as witness. By evicting from the throne and letting a baby who can easily be killed by some power hungry minister to grab power puts the nation in jeopardy. Also the two season together tell a complete story and I feel a third season is completely unnecessary and may drag the story needlessly and make it lukewarm since the main political conflict is already over which was the main draw for me. I also don\\'t want an explanation about the resurrection plant it is better as an engmatic mystery.The tactics and strategies to trap, lure and destroy the zombies was also fun to see and workaround in your head and never broke the rules and became implausible.,It was only when I reached episode 5 of series 1 that I relaized that the Queen was in fact the Prince\\'s mother. This was the Queen who looked about 24/25 and the Prince who was clearly 35-40.This was by no means the most ludicrous part od this series.The evil Queens father bought back to life or at least saved from death by so that he could persecute the Prince and anyone who helped him ( including the woman who saved him).The Prince\\'s right hand man who having taken an arrow through his right shoulder, then gets stabbed in the stomach, then gets a volley of 6 arroes stcuk in his back and rather than dying where he was decides to go for a crawl into the distant forests to be found by the Prince and die in his arms.I swear they must have had a meeting of the script writers who were given an agenda to make this series as ridiculuous and illogical as they could.I used to be a massive fan of all S. Korean films and series but this and Squid Games is making lose faith.PLEASE don\\'t make a 3rd series!!!!,This is one of the best zombie series that I have ever seen. I did not expect to watch this series at first, when it was on trend. Many of my friends suggested me since the first season that this series is be worth to watch. I decided to watch when it released season 2 and it did not disappoint me at all. Kingdom is a horror Netflix series that combine the story of period politics and zombies together. Set in Joseon period, by the time strange rumors about their ill king spread through the kingdom. The crown prince becomes their only hope against a mysterious plague that overtaking the land. Within 2 seasons at present, 12 episodes, with a duration about an hour each. As I kept watching, it kept more excited and excited. It took me not so long to finish the whole season. There are so many things that I like about this series. The cinematography and visual effect are just another level, the zombies truthfully look so real, the way they run also make it look scarier. Besides all performers are well casted, they convey their character very well and act very naturally. It would be better that there are more than 6 episodes per season. For me, the last episode of season 1 is the most thrilled part. Kingdom is an 18+ recommended, which included many blood and violent scenes, thus it maybe not be proper for under 18 age or people who easily fearful. Overall, it is a superb series that cram with great outline, incredible performance and leading visual effect. Recommend!,I accidentally found this while I was scrolling through Netflix. It\\'s such a great zombie series! It\\'s in thriller and horror genre. The scene, costume, and the effects is so real and believable. The monsters run really fast so my heart too.,I love all movies/shows thats has anything to do with zombie. But this show..is where all zombie tv need to learn from. I was so used to the adrenaline rush that when i finished the show, i feel so low because I didnt have that rush anymore. Thats what good tv is about! It makes you so engrossed in the story that you feel you are actually living it. AMAZING! Must watch!,What a horror thriller series. One of the most beautiful series I have ever seen. Just loved it. Recommended\\r\\nHappy Watching.,The last episode ruined absolutely everything. Don\\'t waste your time.,Korean film never fails. Great story line, characters and scary factor. I\\'m American and absolutely love Asian culture and the historical aspects surrounding it! Very impressed with this series.,This show is really good and I am currently waiting for the 3rd season.The first 2 episodes are kind of slow but it soon picks up its pace with the action.,This series truly overrated. Even though there are many factors that made this bad, but the thing I hate the most is the logic. They can just solve the problem or defend themselve easily but use the worst solution that made them desperate. Also some of the roles should be clever enough to know the situation, but she/he did something that worsen the situation.Actually my honest rating for this series is 5/10, because there are many series with the same level as this one. But there too many people that overrated this series, so I give 2 star.,A lo largo de la historia hemos visto distintos tipos de zombies con distintas situaciones cada uno y diferentes ambientes, los hemos visto en videojuegos (Resident Evil), películas (La noche de los muertos vivientes) y hasta en series (The Walking Dead) como es en este caso.Pero Kingdom se diferencia de las demás series, películas o videojuegos de zombies, esta historia es una historia nunca antes vista y creo que podría decir que es la mejor historia de zombies que he visto hasta ahora (o por lo menos en mi TOP 5).Para entender mejor esta historia tenemos que saber qué se ambienta en la época de la dinastía Joseon (1392-1897).La historia empieza con nuestro protagonista que es el príncipe heredero Lee Chang el cual tras saber que su padre esta enfermo y al no poder saber que le pasa ya que le prohiben la entrada al palacio, se embarca con su fiel sirviente Cho Hak-ju a por el doctor que trato a su padre con la enfermedad que tenia.Esta historia se distingue de las demás porque ya no solo hablamos del problema de los zombies sino también le da un giro a estos mismos al darles una historia a estos y una historia a nuestro protagonista totalmente diferente ya que este mismo al recorrer el camino se empieza a dar cuenta de los problemas que tiene su población: no tienen comida, están en la miseria, el gobierno los oprime, etc.Ya por ultimo dire que esta serie tiene una fotografía hermosa con unos planos que nunca se habían visto en otra película o serie de zombies y que se ven asombrosos.Conclusion.Si te gustan las películas o series de zombies te va a encantar esta serie, te enamoraras de los personas y te encantara la historia.10/10.,There is blood eveeywhere.. Whats better and thrilling than that in a series . One problem is solved another appears and I was like bruuuuh they all are gonna die.. must watch this series.,I was very impress when i start watching season 1 and i\\'m very excited too wait the next season come on Netflix. Because Jun Ji Hoon appear on the last episode to make spoiler to the next season, it\\'s more misterious and i can\\'t see the ending of this drama.But , you can read Newsboost.com until the next season appear on Netflix.Fakta menarik tentang poker semuanya terangkum dalam Newsboost.News Boost adalah situs yang menyediakan berbagai berita yang terintegrasi untuk membahas perihal terkait judi online.Kami mengumpulkan berbagai berita dan informasi yang menyangkut semua hampir seluruh jenis judi online baik yang tradisional maupun modern.Konten yang kami hadirkan juga memuat referensi agen atau penyedia layanan mesin judi online terbaik yang dapat Anda mainkan agar informasi yang disampaikan akurat.Baca selengkapnya di: https://newsboost.com/category/tips-bermain/,This has been one the best shows I have seen in a long while. I binged it in 1 week, both seasons (12 eps total)Great acting, amazing costumes and a brilliant plot that makes, the seemingly played out zombie horror genre, soar.Cannot wait for season 3!!,Superb story, excellent cinematography and great acting !!!,In spite of a quite original historical background for a zombie series and a few convincing actors, writing is lazy and uninspired, characters\\' psychology is embarrassingly shallow and inconsistent, editing inflicts on viewers endless boring and useless scenes, chronology regularly lacks any sense at all, dry much as military logics, the most dramatic and supposedly intense scenes are wasted by constant whining and/or screaming. Definitely to avoid if you\\'re over 12yo and are used to pay just basic attention to detail.,This series is terrible. The plot is poor, the acting is awful with terrible \\'over-acting\\' and ridiculous facial expressions. On top of that, it is very poorly dubbed and translated. If you think this is one of the best horror shows ever made then you clearly need to watch a bit more.. Maybe give Haunting of Hill House a watch instead.. I\\'m annoyed at just how misleading the ratings are.,KINGDOM is basically a Korean GAME OF THRONES without a complex plot and nudity.High budgets (USD 1,7 million per episode), really beautiful cinematography, a pleasing eyes costumes and set, great casting decision, and well written story.I love how they edit this series. They give the back story when it needed and in the right time. The portion of \"Zombie\\'s disease\" is long enough so I could appreciate the drama of power struggle for the throne more.I hope Season 2 would have more episodes and not taking too long to be made.,Kingdom is excellent on all levels. A master class in the Zombie genre.,TV Review: Kingdom Series 1 & 29/10Kingdom is a Netflix Original Korean TV Series first shown in 2019, based on the webcomic series by Kim Eun-hee called \\'The Kingdom of the Gods\\', and wonderfully adapted for TV by her too. With just six episodes in each season (between 36 and 56 minutes), this part crazy zombie horror, part historical political family drama, is a fantastic choice for a binge watch, especially as season 2 directly follows on from the events of the first season.Set in the beautiful landscape of 16th century Korea during the Joeson period, a few years after it was invaded by Japan. Season 1 follows Crown Prince Lee Chang (Ju Ji-hoon) who has been accused of treason by the heartless Queen Cho (Kim Hye-jun), his concubine mother who is no older than he is, and her merciless father, the Chief State Councillor Cho Hak-ju (Seung-ryong Ryu), who is also leader of the Haewon Cho clan, they are slowly trying to pilfer power from the king. Planning on replacing the Crown Prince with a legitimate heir, they confine the smallpox suffering King to his chambers and are keeping him \\'alive\\' with a mysterious plant, while not permitting any visitors, including the Prince.Together with his steadfast servant Mu-Yeung (Kim Sang-ho), the Crown Prince travels in search of the physician who was invited to treat his father at the royal palace, so that he can try and get some clear information on what has happened... Along their voyage, they become acquainted with dauntless physician\\'s assistant Seo Bi (Bae Doona, who you may recognise from Sense 8), the incredibly naïve and selfish Cho Beom Pal (Jun Suk-ho, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Rob McElhenney) and a young enigmatic gunman named Young Shin (Kim Sungkyu).The Crown Prince and his scooby gang must navigate their way through political plots and hordes of the deranged undead whilst trying to unlock the secrets of an outbreak and saving the good people of their nation.The cinematography throughout both seasons is spectacular, with a mixture of vibrant surroundings and authentic costumes, the show makes fantastic use of its high production budget to make the set come to life. The directors really manage to use real horror and emotion to create a sense of dread and impending doom. There is gore aplenty and the zombies are terrifying, don\\'t think snail pace falling to pieces Walking Dead zombies, these guys are a cross between what you would see in World War Z or 28 days later, there\\'s no rest as these zombies with an unusual twist are running non-stop. Another thing running constantly through both seasons is the theme of social inequality, scenes such as burying the rich and burning the poor, and the lower class being starved intentionally by the crown, there is much political intrigue, similar in a way to Game of Thrones, more so in the second season.\"Life is the same. The people are still hungry, and the country is still in ruins. But I believe you can bring about change. Am I wrong?\"The writing is fast paced, and the plot is multi-layered, with a mixture of shock, drama and a dark comedy that I\\'ve now come to expect from Korean writers, each episode adds a layer of suspense and intrigue. Some storylines are quite taboo, especially one which runs through the second season and can be difficult to watch. The characters have great depth and interesting stories, combined with some impressive acting you become emotionally involved in their situations which for me is always a sign of great writing. My personal favourites being Mu-Yeung, his mannerisms and expressions are fantastic to watch, Seo Bi, the heroine and the brains of the outfit, and Queen Cho who is haunting but brilliant.In all honestly this is one of the best shows I\\'ve watched in a while; it was entertaining and fresh with twists and turns to keep me on my toes. With season 2 ending on an enigma, there is a possibility of a third season, though nothing has been announced at this stage. If you haven\\'t watched this gem yet, then you\\'re missing out on some amazing television.,A lot of fake accounts here which are rating the show, too bad. The series have great scenery, sets and costumes. But, the story is slow, the acting is sometimes good, but sometimes terrible, especially from the background actors (which also made me laugh now and then). Anyway, if you don\\'t care too much about good acting and like the concept of Asian zombies, give it a try.,Very interesting and funny horror contentVery interesting and funny horror contentVery interesting and funny horror content,Kingdom takes place in 16th Century Korea and begins with a tale of political conspiracy: the throwing of the Crown Prince (Ju Ji-Hoon) into exile and cast as a traitor by the King\\'s head magistrate/advisor Jo Hak-jo (Ryu Seung-ryong), who has also managed to put his own daughter in place as the new Queen. As a mystery surrounding the King and his disappearance from public life intensifies a new threat awakens in parallel to this attempted coup. Tied in with this subterfuge is a plague of the undead expanding and spreading across the regions and destroying and devouring everything in its path, and the Crown Prince finds his exile to be right in the plague\\'s path.What is done well is the slow growth from a single undead entity through to a handful and then on to an unmanageable horde and the fear and devastation that ensues parallels this escalation in numbers nicely.\\r\\nThe Crown Prince, the true heir to the throne is intent on claiming his rightful throne and is investigating the situation around this outbreak alongside helping and fighting back against the epidemic with the help of his bodyguard Muyeong (Sang-ho Kim) and nurse/physician Seobi (Doona Bae). There is more to the machinations and plotting than first seems here and I\\'m very much looking forward to seeing this unfold.The mix of horror/violence and Korean humour feels a bit strange and is thankfully confined to the earlier episodes. It doesn\\'t really fit in having a comedy character alongside the tone and seriousness of the show but the Korean theme of people in positions of power/authority being incompetent/elevated above their ability is definitely on show here.Production values are superb, depicting the time and styles wonderfully well, alongside some truly epic countryside. Which then gets destroyed by the feeding, braindead horde. The action and suspense is really well done and performed. The style of the undead is also particularly impressive as they run but also succumb to multiple falls/trips/stumbles in their mindless pursuit of prey/food.,The best coming from the zombie genre for years.Plot, story, caracter development, acting, set and costumes are as good as it gets.Im craving for more mayhem.,Probably the best \"zombies\" EPIC series ever made. Forget Walking Dead. This is a fantastic Series and great acting. The two seasons went by really fast. Hope to see the third one soon.,WHY ONLY 6 EPISODES PER SEASON WHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!,An absolutely astonishing series with a refreshing and more realistic undertone within the zombie genre. The setting. The dialogue. The acting. It\\'s all perfectly intertwined.,I love this show, the qwality is amazing!!\\r\\nEven the cast is pict verry wel. The movie sets are just suberb! I love this! 😉,It surprised me early in the year a good series. Thanks Netflix,Wow! Zombies in mediaeval times! Well written characters, subtle twists, eerie atmosphere. Bae doona steals the show as a fearless, ingenious physician. Koreans yet again prove they do know how to tell a story. Well done Netflix!,Very well acted and innovative series, zombies and internal power struggles all included! Can\\'t wait for 2nd series!,Kind of mixture of the Walking Dead and the Game of Thrones.. in unfamiliar time zone.. (the Middle Age of Korea)Nice story line, Nice clothes and Palaces..I think the combination of unexpected things made quite good result..Enjoy your time... 6 episode in one Season is too short!!!,Okay so first of all the comparison of \\'kingdom\\' with \\'the walking dead\\' and \\'game of thrones\\' doesn\\'t even make a single bit of sense. When any new show comes with the similar plot and storyline, it is always compared to the shows that are best in that particular genre. This is very ridiculous and stupid,stop doing it. Talking about \\'the walking dead\\', that show is almost completed 150 episodes and has maintained the rating 8.2 even after season 7,8 being lowest rated of the entire series, still it\\'s going strong with it\\'s latest season 9,10 being entertaining again. And this show has 8.3 rating after just 17K votes. If ratings don\\'t matter to y\\'all then also stop bragging senseless talk. And the comparison with GOT is out of the world. Take this show as a separate standalone show and then write about your opinion, but stop comparing two great shows with this show.,I love it, I always wanted to see zombies during the medieval era. The origin and characteristics of the zombies are also very original. Definitely recommend!,I only checked this out of curiosity but got pleasantly surprised how good it was and ended up bingeing. Every episode is full of action and there\\'s no dull moment. At first I thought the idea of mixing period drama with zombie is laughable but with here, it works. Overall great and I couldn\\'t wait for the next season!,The only disappointment was the story for this season ended at just 6 episodes\\r\\nI hope season 2 is released soon,Well choreographed battles along with political intrigue, authentic period costumes and frightening looking zombies makes this series a real treat for horror fans!,Thanku Netflix for being global and introducing us to a different filmmaking schools other than Hollywood. WE the non-American viewers are sick and tired from hollywood\\'s films that shows Americans trying to save the planet all the time. But thanks to Netflix we can see different and more beautiful art by (Korea, Spain, Italy, etc. ).,Korean zombies and horror movies are so well done. I highly recommend this series for its flair, costumes and make up, and look forward to season 2.,Brilliant Masterpiece!!! Every scene from starting to ending it was like damnnnn... Whattt a series man !!!Waiting for season 3. And entire series 😍😍😍😍😍,Best zombie show ever produced! From the very first episode I was hooked! Has genuine creepy/scary moments and a proper good story! It idsone of my favourite shows of all time, even people who don\\'t watch foreign shows/movies watched this and loved it! A must see for everyone! Especially if you love zombie movies.,I just finished season 2 and I can only say I want more. This show had me captivated through every episode.\\r\\nI must admit I had grown tired of the zombie genre, but this show really proved that a genre can never be boring if there is a great plot.\\r\\nI can only recommend Kingdom, it has everything from great acting, korean history and a well done plot.\\r\\nI hope a season 3 will come soon!,Rating above 8 for trash?\\r\\nPlease do not watch if you have any love for Zombie series. Bad writing , boring waste of time.\\r\\nNetfail TV Show.,I\\'m a huge zombie fan, so I needed to watch this series. Until now, the only Korean zombie flick I\\'d seen was Train to Busan. If you haven\\'t seen that one yet, I strongly suggest watching it since it\\'s one of the best zombie flicks I\\'ve seen. I\\'m amazed at the level of cinematography coming out of South Korea these days. On par with Hollywood.Kingdom is set in the Joseon kingdom (early Korea) in what I imagine is around the year 1600, judging by the crude long guns and talk of Japanese invasions. This period relied strongly on a caste system, in which noblemen had absolute power over the lower ranks, and those at the bottom were thought of as nothing more than dogs. If you\\'re unfamiliar with Kdrama, you might find some scenes strange when people defer to their seniors without hesitation because of this, but you quickly adjust as you realize this was how life was. I also admit that it can be hard to tell some characters apart when the noblemen are all dressed the same and have the same beards. Most of the time, this doesn\\'t matter.In short and with no spoilers, the crown prince finds himself in a power struggle with the pregnant queen consort and her power-hungry father, who want to take over control of Joseon after the child\\'s birth. The prince suspects something strange is happening at the palace when the queen denies him entry to see the king. When the prince travels to another city for answers, he finds himself in the midst of a zombie pandemic. The prince must find a way to save his people while fighting to regain his place as heir to the throne.Having just finished the 2nd season, I think this show is great. Being set in the medieval wilderness and bamboo huts of Joseon is unique in itself and adds to the tension. There is lots of blood and gore while not going overboard. There are shocking moments that you\\'ve never seen in other zombie films, some that have you laughing and others biting your nails. And nobody is safe - rich or poor, young or old.The story line is decent, though it can seem a little jumbled at times. The characters do a great job and I don\\'t feel like I\\'m watching actors reading a script. It\\'s also nice to see Doona Bae from Sense8 in a native role.I prefer subtitles, though I watched a little bit of the dubbing and found the voice actors seemed adequate. The dubbed version also lined up fairly well with the people speaking, at least from what I saw.If you\\'re into zombie or horror films, give this a chance. I\\'m highly anticipating season 3 and hope for more seasons after that.,Of the best series I\\'ve seen.This makes the undead have feet of mud and tremble to the guts,It\\'s like game of thrones with Korean Samurai, but things acctually happen here!,Well it is medieval ages with the whole meaning of the word, and everyone thinks wt..f with the songs, but I\\'m writing my first review just for it\\'s sake. I loved it! I loved the show, the soundtracks(every minute I was waiting for one) the special effects, oh yeah those....netflix always does it work! That is how you do it!,Kingdom on netflix was exciting. Can\\'t wait for season two!,Excited every second, Serious story, Powerful performance, kingdom is The best of korea series horror of 2019,The series is very well directed, but there is a massive amount of stupidity with the main cast and the writing. It takes away from the plot severely.,Just finished season and am very disappointed that season 2 is not here yet! This is a damn good show that\\'s well worth watching. Im a big horror fan and this delivers in every way. The drama aspect brought in so much for me. I havent been invested into characters like this since The Game of Thrones. Good job to the directors actors, writers and special FX for coming through on this one. A+ work mates.. Cheers!,Really love this show has history action comedy drama gore twist great cinematography , writings great acting as well they transform the zombie genre love the pacing of the episodes too .I loved the edge of the seat moments go and watch this you won\\'t regret it can\\'t wait for the next season hope it stays at a six episode season like the walking dead was at the beginning,I was skeptical at first.. zombies? Would like to see them pull it off.And they did. Great acting by a wonderful cast, the zombies too. It was surprisingly enjoyable and kept me on the edge of my seat at times.,Looking forward to Season 3 now, hopefully it\\'s not gonna take too long.,It\\'s an amazing show, just got to get passed the talking because it\\'s translated into English but still amazing! A twist in your typical zombie shows/movies.,So disappointed - what appeared to be a grand epic, was just a disguise for a supernatural ghoulish zombie feature.,This Korean film just put all the American zombie movies in place. Damn that was good. Fingers crossed for a few more seasons and more episodes per season.,The best zombie series ever!!! Cant wait for season 2,Excellent South Korean Zombie drama, Way better then TWD. Cant wait for season 2.,The entire series is a hundred million miles above every thing else. They bought Cinema to TV. Outstanding,Must Watch!\\r\\nBoth Season 1 and Season 2 are Amazing!!Realistic! Perfect!,This is a next level release. beyond excellent storyline !,One of those films i heard about but thought its just hyped probably wont like it ill put it on the back burner... I was wrong i also did this with game of thrones. My advice go watch it stop reading reviews its a fantastic series that has a different feel and all the right parts.,I loved this TV show , good story we wait for the 3 season,This zombie series is now my favorite! Esp when i saw the last ep. of s2! One of my fave casts Ji Hyun Jun showed up!! Can\\'t wait to watch the s3!! I love everything about this series!,Walking dead needs to take some tips from this show!! Amazing how the show ends, just gets you mad there\\'s is only 6 episodes.,The best Zombie series in Korean Drama for me. I wish they could add more episodes to season 1. Waiting for the next Season.,This is series is written by Kim Eun hee same writer who penned tvn hit signal and maybe that\\'s why I gavethis drama a shot.The kingdom is a fresh take on the zombie genre just like every zombie concepta disease breaks out and infects the population and main array of explosions,handguns when fight zombiescharacters fight hard to survive.Unlike other zombie shows kingdom takes place in medievalkorea strips away the usual bombastic/array of explosions, handguns, & tactical gear when fighting offzombies in the typical Hollywood styleThe Drama not only has a fresh take on the genre but also used limited CGI and makeup makes up for aa more realistic vibe.The Actors did a pretty got job the creators know who they are casting.The main cast consists of likable characters. Ju Ji-hoon plays the role of Prince Chang, the Crown Prince who\\'s an only son of the sickly Emperor,set to rule thejoseon. He\\'s a compassionate/simply character with a mellow temper/to some degree introverted who learns to understand the mistreatment of the commoners. Prince Chang becomes gets entangled in the political upheaval and conspiracies to overthrowthe Queen/Hak Ju faction\\'s defilement, alongside the assistance of his trustworthy guardian, Mu Yeong.Bae Doona plays the keen/kind Seo Bi, a doctor\\'s associate who has practical experience in herbs/prescription at Jiyulheon clinic situated in Dongnae, who attempts to discover the remedy for the abnormal outbreak. Indeed, even with all the disturbance, she puts the intrigue/prosperity of others first.Kim Sung Gyu isYeon-shin, who\\'s somewhat reckless and kind of twisted in so many levels. He\\'s additionally has a nicknack for using rifle gun. Much like Prince Chang and Seo Bi, he feels for the commoner\\'s people. He\\'s an individual from a tiger hunting group from Sanju.The intro and end credits are beautiful. The general writing is simplified. Too straight-forward/simple to understand. There\\'s a touch of turns, not excessively shocking but rather satisfying as the mystery unfolds. The exchange/collaborations between characters are decent, not very graceless, in spite of the fact that there is a bit of work, however, needs depth. The acting is good. It isn\\'t excessively dramatized but quite memorable and convincing.Music is additionally something I don\\'t see except if I think that its awful or unfitting, yet in Kingdom that is not the situation. There weren\\'t any extremely noteworthy melodies/ostsin light of the fact that it\\'s everything instrumental to the extent I recollect. In any case, the director has made ideal utilization of music to build tension to keep you at the edge of your seat.The cinematography is lovely with its wide shots of scenic views on rich beautiful forest/royal palace buildings.The ending is anti-climactic with a cliffhanger & twist with so many questions left unanswered.,Fantastic pacing and production. Storytelling is very fresh compared to other zombie genre films. I ended up binging it in just one Sunday evening.Very impressed! Will be anticipating the next season.,Stuck inside because of the plague? Why not watch a show about a plague?In all seriousness, though, if I haven\\'t mentioned this show before, season 2 just released on Netflix, and it is easily in my top three favorite shows.A taut political drama about rival factions vying for control set against the backdrop of a zombie outbreak. Interesting, well-written characters, well acted, well directed, good pacing (only picked up my phone to look up where I\\'d seen an actor before). Even Heather was riveted by the story.It compares well to the early seasons of Game of Thrones, but without any of the sexual content or swearing. Violent and gory at times, this is probably not suited for younger children.,Verry good story, great characters!\\r\\nHope there will be a second season!,Bingewatched Kingdom on Netflix. I\\'d go so far as to say that this is one of the best series I\\'ve seen in recent years. Not your typical zombie show. Great story and characterisation. 👍🏼👍🏼\\r\\nIt has certain elements of Game of Thrones, such as the ever reliant protagonist like Jon Snow, scheming queen like Cersei, power-hungry patriarch like Tywin Lannister and a bunch of half-dead baddies like White Walkers! The cinematography, production design and musical score is phenomenal! Can\\'t wait for season 2!,I was distracted and put this on, thinking was a movie. Stay up until 4am watching all first season, yea that good. Watch it is so good. If you like Game of Thrones and The walking dead. You like this series. Just do not get attached to any of the characters. Be ready to laugh and cry. You will go through an emotional rollercoaster in one episode. Just be ready to be stuck to the TV.,It\\'s so hard to find decent zombie dramas these days, even more so great ones like \\'kingdom\\'.\\r\\nAs with most of the horror genre, eastern movies/tv series do such an amazing job, and this is no exception! Loved it from start to finish and I cannot wait for season two. Korean medieval zombies, what more could you want! 10/10,In general, I was impressed.\\r\\nGreat directing, writing, and acting; Everything Perfect 10/10,Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! Terrifying! I would recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of horror..,I had noticed these series on Netflix, but didn\\'t think I was gonna watch. I decided to start watching it a week ago, and now I cannot wait to see season 3 confirmation and hopefully continuation of this amazing story, and the way it is told is incredible. Don\\'t want to set expectations, please watch it, I am sure you will enjoy every second.,I couldn\\'t stop watching it like binge watching game of thrones,Once you start, you can\\'t stop watching.\\r\\nBetter the z nation, and all zombies movies I have seen.\\r\\nTHE BEST.,Do you remember watching the first season of the walking dead and being amazed at what they pulled off with that show? How lived in the world felt and how great the acting was? Then season 2 happened and it lost its magic. Well this is how I feel about kingdom. This show is amazing. I\\'m a huge South Korean cinema fan but I tend to stay away from their shows because they\\'re usually just teen dramas but I heard this show was different and was planning on watching it but then I remembered how Netflix loved cancelling their originals so I held off on it. Now a few days away from the season 2 premier I decided to finally start watching this show and I watched all six episodes in one sitting. This show is so damn good and if you\\'re a fan of zombies and/or South Korean cinema then you have to check this one out. It\\'s the most revolutionary zombie property since the walking dead.,It is not another walking dead, there is a history and objectives. Political and civilians problemas It is a great serie.,It was hard to concentrate and follow the story. It\\'s not because of the story itself but the pace is quite slow. I think the 6 episodes can be done in 2-3 episodes. If I had to watch it in the cinema without controlling, I could have found this show boring.\\r\\nMany parts can be skippable ( most fights scenes) , so I finished the seasion 1 in 3 and half hours, and was enough. nothing missed. My expectation for zombie act might be too high though, the zombie acts are pretty awkward.Cannot deny it\\'s interesting to see zombies in historical Asian stories nevertheless.,It\\'s a quiet exciting showing. I recommend it for you,Well written, directed, and acted and fresh. Loved every episode!,Stunning film!\\r\\nGreat directing, writing, and acting\\r\\nOverall cinematography is 10/10\\r\\nCant wait for Season 2!,Im waiting for season 2. Im always wait for drama like this,The new attempt to introduce zombies in oriental history, not modern Western zombies, was good, and it is not slow and makes it fun enough for rapid development,Story and characters are interesting. Watched the entire season in one go. Looking forward for season 2,The most amazing piece of tv drama in a long time.\\r\\nAn extremely exciting and entertaining mix of asian/korean historic drama and zombie horror. The drama is a classical power struggle between the crown prince of a weak king and heir to the throne on one side and a powerful official who is plotting to get his own bloodline to ascend the throne. This accidently involves the creation of a zombie plague.What is in my opinion amazing about this show is:\\r\\n1.Like the zombies in World war Z, these zombies are fast, savage and will kill everything in their path, but as a twist only after the sun goes down. They fear the sun so during the day they will hide in some kind of coma. This makes for a great contrast between relatively safety in the daytime and impending doom as night approaches.2. I like the drama and power struggle in the royal court, and the contrast between rich and poor in old Korean society, which is a redline through the series. The greed for power and disrespect for the lower classes is actually the root of the zombie plague.3. The costumes and scenary are just spectacular, so beautiful in 4k resolution. And without being into Korean history the cloth and environment seems very original to the time periode. This can\\'t always be said of many western or chinese period tvseries where people are dressed up like something from Lord of the Rings or other fantasy movies. If the story is placed in a time period stay true to that period.\\r\\nThis means a lot to me as I am a Dane, and I just hate to see how vikings are dressed up like freaking orcs or some kind of other jokes.4. The fight scenes are great and very detailed and gory. I just like the true feeling these scenes depict. Here you won\\'t see any \"House of flying daggers\" style gong-fu with people running around on the roofs or flying through bamboo forest. That was charming and refreshing 15-20years ago, but I just like gritty and true fight scenes where people actually fight for dear mother with all means possible.\\r\\nYou will see small kids gunned down by arrows or eaten by their own zombie mother, so it isn\\'t for the fainth hearted though.5. They kept the series in the original language, which just add to the true feeling. Again as a Dane I grew up with subtitled Hollywood movies, actually that is one of the best ways to learn a language, and the way I learned english and german. If you are watching a Hollywood ww2 movie and the Nazis are speaking english with german accent it is just a no go for me. Please keep all movies in original language and sub not dub.6. The characters all play very well and you get emotionally connected to them and their struggle. Especially the prince\\'s transformation from weak to confident man, who is taking action is interesting.However, I am not overly fond of the sometimes wacky humor, but that is quite normal for korean/asian tv-series, in my experience.Bottom-line, this is a really great show and I swallowed the whole season (6 episodes) in one sitting, and just can\\'t wait for season 2. Well done Netflix and Korean movie industry, it was worth every single penny of abonnement.,This show is the best show ever made, pure magic.\\r\\ni love the fact that they speak korean, it makes it like 100 times better, even though i must read the subitiles.\\r\\nlove it, you guys must watch it,Awesome show, but its only 6 episodes and it ends with a huge cliffhanger, so unless you like waiting in suspense for about 1 year, then wait for the second season (also 6 episodes) and binge watch. You will like this show if you like walking dead, this reminds me of the beginning of the walking dead, except this is in Korea back in the 17th century which makes it different. The actors are also great, and there is some good humor in here as well. 8/10,Actually, it was short. However i didn\\'t know the end was comming. I cannot wait for seoson 2.,At first, I donot think that it is fabulous but its crazyyy,Gracefully paced and real atmospheric suspense building,Way too many 10s here. Idea is awesome, the landscapes and costume and general world building was done very well but in no way is this a 10.First - the characters development and understanding is painfully slow. Of course they shouldn\\'t just know that they are zombies and start fighting but it\\'s like 2 or 3 nights before they stop being frozen with fear and realize they can use a sword. Brings me to second point, why don\\'t they hunt and kill them during the day?Overall felt like the first few episodes were ok with enough of the zombie scenes to make it entertaining but then it finally got really good in episode 5 and 6 (although they really drew this one out) and end it on a bad cliff hanger.My advice would be to wait until season 2 and watch it at once because I don\\'t see myself waiting on edge of my seat to throw it on whenever it comes out, Exemplary zombie TV series\\r\\n, An impressive zombie story set in medieval Korea\\r\\n, A nice South Korean zombie-filled horror/drama TV series...\\r\\n, Exciting but couple of faults\\r\\n, Quality South-Korean Zombie show.\\r\\n, SEASON 1 & 2 THOUGHTS.\\r\\n, Great Zombies!\\r\\n, Too good\\r\\n, Great\\r\\n, Season 2\\r\\n, ZOMBIE SPECTACULAR (Series 2)\\r\\n, season 1=9 ,2= 5\\r\\n, Incredible zombie flick\\r\\n, Way better than expected historical zombie effort\\r\\n, Kingdom: Ashin of the North\\r\\n, Pretty Good\\r\\n, Perfect in Every Aspect Except for Acting\\r\\n, Season 1&2 review\\r\\n, Just one word comes to my mind\\'\\'AMAZING\\'\\'\\r\\n, Like a bad Comedy\\r\\n, Welcome to Korean Drama\\r\\n, The Struggle\\r\\n, Intriguing, gripping and intense !!\\r\\n, Don\\'t judge a book by its cover!

It\\'s a little choppy at times and essentially feels like two three-episode series stitched together, and at times it\\'s rushed or too slow. But I enjoyed the religious-themed plotting and the way it\\'s used to shine a light on various aspects of human behaviour. The CGI isn\\'t great but the show is high on drama and I can forgive the occasional misstep for the exciting set-pieces it has to offer. It\\'s not SWEET HOME, but it\\'s better than average.,I sat down to watch the 2021 South Korean TV series titled \"Hellbound\" (aka \"Jiok\"), partly because I saw the trailer on Netflix and also because I was told that it was from the guy that made \"Train to Busan\". So I was gearing up for something spectacular, especially since the trailer was interesting.And I made it two episodes into the ordeal and then I just gave up. Wow, talk about a swing and a miss. The storyline told in \"Hellbound\" was just laughably poorly written and had nothing that appealed to me, to be bluntly honest. So this was a major disappointment.The storyline told in \"Hellbound\" was just downright boring, especially because nothing particularly interesting happens as you suffer through nearly 50 minutes of excruciating boredom with each episode. And it didn\\'t help one bit that the character gallery in \"Hellbound\" was generic, flat, boring and had the appeal of watching paint drying on a wall.Now, I am sure that the concept might have seemed interesting when the creators were penning it out on paper. But the transition from idea and paper to the screen was just bland and anti-climatic.Visually then \"Hellbound\" was actually okay. But special effects can only do so little when there is nothing in terms of contents for a storyline or interesting characters.My rating of \"Hellbound\" lands on a generous three out of ten stars. And this is not something I will be returning to watch the rest of, since it totally fell short of providing me with anything worthwhile in terms of entertainment or enjoyment. Usually South Korea puts out fairly good movies and TV series, but of course it is utopia to think that everything that comes from South Korea is going to be gold, and \"Hellbound\" certainly was not gold.,Korean Drama \"Hellbound\" is an atmospheric drama with a dark story and masterful direction.The drama has an interesting story to offer. Exploring the nature of men when an unexpected new element appears, changing the way we lived so far and spreading fear. Fear that is the common factor that everyone uses in order to achieve their goals. And the ending was masterfully handled as well, with a huge cliffhanger to prepare the audience for what is to come next.However, and apart from those, the drama felt hectic and partial. The pace was all over the place, with events following one another in a way that wasn\\'t either smooth nor served the drama well. In addition, the drama was disjointed, as its parts didn\\'t blend in together nor followed each other nicely.Finally, the CGI were not great, but the performances were masterful by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 5 out of 10.,As daemons manifest on the streets of Korea, torturing and then incinerating their hell-bound victims, a brutal new religious hierarchy arises. Intentionally or otherwise, \\'Hellbound\\' is a scathing attack on religion. In the face of horrific and inexplicable events, people desperate for answers turn to those who claim to hold a monopoly on truth, who take it upon themselves to rule in the name of the divine, who set the rules that define goodness and sin, and who quickly turn to coercion and force to supress alternate ideas and maintain their exalted position. The classic theological paradox manifests (reconciling divine love with infant damnation) and the fate of non-believers is traditional: immolation. I watched an English-subtitled version on Netflix, so can\\'t really comment on the acting or the original script but I thought the series was excellent. The special effects are a bit weak at times but the plot is fast moving and compelling. The film has a bit of a scale problem, coming across as a bit of an isolated fable with little mention of the world outside of Korea or the response to the events from other religions, otherwise it\\'s outstanding. Fans of Philip Pullman and Dawkinistas should especially enjoy the show\\'s bloody spiritual excesses.,To put it shortly, Hellbound is an interesting mumbo jumbo series, well-acted with a very good flow, some outstanding VFX, beefy \"things\" that would have been better depicted and shown as skinny witch-like creatures, some total nonsense along the way, messages that every viewer would decipher and analyze at his own pace and on his own belief.It is gripping with a compelling flow and finishes on a super high mysterious note that just shatters all viewers\\' built-up belief momentum up to that point and starts constructing a new brazen wall with unlikely bricks.,Panic on the streets of Seoul, as three demons seek to harvest sinners souls, if you\\'re one of the selected, there\\'s no chance to be neglected, as a god has got you under his control - with the usual misguided disciples to help.If this doesn\\'t get you thinking of your own mortality and the extents that false prophets, and those that feel they have more legitimacy, try to corrupt and misguide, then I\\'m not sure what will. Powerful and thoughtful stuff.,EVERYTHING about this show is terrible, oh wait the CGI was decent but it last 2 minutes out of an hour story is stupid the acting is mediocre and dialogue dialogue dialogue and its BORING dialogue. So if you want to watch people talk and they talk about a story that is absolutely idiotic here you go. I read this is from the creators of train to busan, I really hope that\\'s not true because train is an absolute BRILLIANT film this isnt even close to a bad high school documentary series.,Hellnound: Korean horror series. Monsters/Demons appear chase sinners, rend them asunder and then reduce their remains to burnt bones and ashes. This is preceded by visitations by \"angels\" who tell the damned of the time and date of their death. A Cult leader claims that these deaths are god\\'s judgement and the dead are sent to Hell. A Social Media influencer, Arrowhead, seeks out those who have been condemned to out them and also calls on his followers to attack wrongdoers. A condemned woman decides to allow her death to be live-streamed. The Arrowheads savagely attack the police, lawyers, anyone who aids the damned. Rather disturbing, especially the sociopathic Cult leader, Jung Jinsu, laughing at the idea that the police would investigate the will of god. The scenes portraying the relentless attacks by the Demons as they pursue, attack and tear their victims to pieces are really top notch horror. Mixed in with this is the tale of a detective, Kyunghu,n investigating the deaths and how Jung Jinsu involves Kyunghun\\'s daughter in the cult\\'s activities. Good and gruesome. Directed by Yeon Sang-ho (Train To Busan), written by Choi Kyu-sok. On Netflix. 8/10.,This one is not enjoyable.Main leads boring .Story script/dialogues not enthusiastic.Cinematography uninteresting and add not much.Just finish 4th episode and consistently used FF button since 3rd.Watch Host instead.,Death Note but Light Yagami is actually Kami and he sends Shinigami to execute the victims.A new Korean horror added to Netflix. I came in knowing minimal about the premise and didn\\'t watch any trailer videos. You should too, because the first 6 minutes of the series gave you an exact taste of what the show is about. Only 6 minutes and it would definitely hook you in, especially if you like horror.The first three episodes was what I call perfection. Since the show has only 6 episodes, it did not waste any time. Even though there\\'s not a whole lot of time for character development, the pacing was incredible. The intensity was through the roof, and I was transfixed to the screen in terror of the inevitability that some characters would face.The last three episodes was where the problem with the show arose. The transition from episode 3 to 4 wasn\\'t smooth because the pacing took a pretty big deceleration. It took some buildup and then the last episode became amazing and rewarding, similar to the first three episodes.Also, this show almost had no chill. It was very violent almost to the point of violence for shock value. Unfortunately there were scenes where people getting beat up that would be very uncomfortable for viewers. However, the portrayal of how cult or religious leaders could bend the meaning of an event or text and manipulate the mind of a large group of people justified the shocking violence of the series. The story worked this theme very well and hooked me in even more.Overall, an incredible and intense horror series that does not pull any punches. For sure for sure check it out. 9.5/10.,\"Upholding righteousness and justice in fear of damnation. Is that truly righteous and just?\"Right off the bat, I must clear up some obvious misunderstandings! This isn\\'t one of those typical Fantasy/Sci-fi/Supernatural shows that deal with Monsters or otherworldly creatures; as opposed to what Netflix might have suggested through their various promotional content on numerous social media platforms lately.This show goes way deeper in scrutinizing not one but many societal demeanours and it is indeed way more philosophic than you guys might have ever imagined!On top of having a powerful statement heeding Religious beliefs, faith, cults etc; Hellbound seemingly speaks against the core idea of Extremism, Radicalism too. The show with much profundity contemplates and argues the very foundation of this dangerous, self-destructive stuff, that can only give rise to chaos and social unrest in society.However, the exact representation here isn\\'t as simple as it may sound. Believe it or not, It has got multifaceted layers of complicated matters and countless subtexts which can only be found out only if you pay good enough attention.Speaking of attention, the terrific writing willingly takes on the mantle and manages to withhold the all-important momentum and that too in a quite sophisticated manner! On the other side, you will get to know an array of versatile characters and each one of them\\'s individualistic narratives that feel so relatable on so many levels!Let us all just appreciate the whole ensemble, the entire cast; who had shown tremendous commitment and sincerity to each of their respective roles! And kudos to the technical team (Especially, the guys who were in charge of the Background Score); for giving it justice from a technological stance as well.My main criticisms lie in its core storyline, which at times, reveals glaring loopholes and is yet to provide transparency in regards to a few of the questions that sprung to my mind. Even though, it was expected that the story would take more than one season to come to a feasible conclusion; got to admit, I was expecting to get at least some kind of closure.,If South Korea had half the population and money of the US, nobody would care about Hollywood again.So far, so VERY good!What a year for South Korean shows!,Ok first off the monsters are pretty cool and the FX are good but man does this thing drag on story wise.There is also this weird character with glowing makeup that is annoying has hell.All in all boring and i don\\'t understand this 7 rating.,It\\'s reasonably well acted and isn\\'t as fast paced as trailers make it seem. The general idea is fine and I do like some of the characters however the storyline is a little patchy and some of the violence may not be to everyone\\'s taste.,This show is so utterly ridiculous. In the modern world I cannot imagine a society reacting with such ignorance and stupidity. Hard pass on the next season if there even is one. Fans of this are low IQ fanboys and girls who will eat up anything.,Korean shows are trending: a horror series in which hairy monsters send sinful people to hell in a very brutal way. According to the synopsis, one would have expected otherwise. Because Netflix advertised that creatures of hell walk on earth and draw people into their realm. That happens here too, but it\\'s just the catalyst for the actual plot. Rather, it examines how such events change society. Monsters and The Manipulation of Mankind.,The series even in its trailer shows some demon like characters but the series is about humanity and not those demon like characters. There are a lot of unanswered questions along with a few characters whom we follow from ep 1 and then suddenly they are gone. We don\\'t see anything about them.Yet, I am very interested in Season 2 (if there would be any).,Do not watch the dubbed version, it is very bad and does not follow the Korean version. Watch the subtitles and it\\'s a much better series, with much more emphasis on what it is trying to show.,At first, I thought, these groups of people are betraying ordinary people to gain something. They are frightening them using special visual effects. But then all these assumptions proved to be wrong, there are actually some magic or power which has been punishing people who are sinners. But, I didn\\'t understand, why the group of people who are frightening people for their own benefit, are left unharmed. But how? They are also sinners, some are murders too.Another thing, I didn\\'t get. What is origin of the power(The monsters or the punishers, I dont know what would be more appropriate).There are just too many plot holes which doesn\\'t make sense. Besides,I felt bored while watching this. I won\\'t definitely recommend this to anyone.,Interesting characters thrust into an intriguing fantasy situation. Good thrills, plot twists, and some action. But most of all, beyond the cool visual effects, the most compelling aspect is how people behave when presented with this predicament.,The concepr is good but this makes no sense. How can an \"angel\" condemn a woman that has children out of wedlock but NOT condemn the leader or his followers that commit murder constantly? I\\'m into the 3rd episode and can\\'t take this kind of stupidity!!! STUPID!!!!!!!,A mysterious face begins to appear before individuals and inform them of their time and day of death. On that day and time three monsters appear and pulverise the victim. The world then becomes embroiled in mass conspiracies about why this is happening and for some it is entertainment and for others it becomes a way to head a new cult. A clever idea with impressive cgi monsters but it doesn\\'t quite work for me and seems a little disjointed.,Grey, gloomy, drab color palette at first turned me off. That is after a much needed catchy opening of events. But the more the story is told it becomes obvious. I\\'ve never seen this before. That is the thing with Kdramas. They take risks and carryout to their logical extend. Not all of them works but when they do it really hooks you in.It\\'s a short series and that\\'s good because there\\'s a lot of explanation and heavy thinking time. For the magnitude to sink in. Either you (can comes to terms with yourself) live by a belief or not. Does life have a meaning? The show seemingly asks .And I like it. There is no comic relief but rather borderline jittery over zealous high with the Arrowheads. And New Truth, what a name for the religion, as whoever grab on to the headline in social media controls the conversation.At first everything is neat and tidy. Until the first prophet died. Then the baby dilemma throws a wrench to really complicates things. Of course the central question is waiting for us in season 2(maybe 3). What are those creatures and where do they come from? And Why are they doing thisThis is a fairly straightforward simple show. Because of the hefty theme. But it\\'s setup is in the mold of a thriller.,More than 53% of people in the world are believers in a religion. We have the freedom to be good or bad, but fear controls and directs the world. Fear of jail fines, of being persecuted or attacked, tortured, etc. But if fear comes from a god, to improve people it changes things and this series is proposed, both by the script and by the director. All series and movies do not teach something to learn because this is one of them, with a great job of interpreting the voodoo man, and the leader of the sect.,More than 53% of people in the world are believers in a religion. We have the freedom to be good or bad, but fear controls and directs the world. Fear of jail , persecuted or attacked, tortured, etc. But if fear comes from a \"God\", to improve people, things change and this series teaches yo. Very good work both through the script and the film director. All series and movies do not teach something to learn because this is one of them, with a great interpretation of the voodoo man as the leader of the sect.,I really don\\'t understand modern tastes in film and tv. Just because it\\'s a fad to like Korean content, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s all actually good.The premise is ridiculous, and the CGI is just so bad for content released in 2021. I\\'ve seen films from the 90\\'s with better CGI.The acting? Atrocious, how can people possibly say this is good?I hope this \"fad\" dies quickly.,Finished watching all 6 episodes in one night. It reminds me a lot of \"Death Note\" if you\\'ve ever watched that series but the idea of divine punishment for sinners and how it\\'s received by the world is a lot different in this series or course. There isn\\'t any explanation for the phenomena the people are experiencing...only that they must have done something to deserve their fates. The series drags you through 6 episodes (so far) that get more bleak and depressing as they carry on and then the series ends on a wtf moment. Hellbound is just not a satisfying experience to watch. There really are no redeeming characters and everyone seems to make deliberate bad decisions for the sake of plot progression.On a side note... Korean movies are also funny sometimes because only the police have guns so a majority of the \"violence\" involves groups of people or a person hitting someone with a bat or club. There is a lot of that in this movie and after a while those scenes get tiring to watch because it\\'s almost like the people they\\'re beating are made of rubber or something. After getting beaten nearly fatally by pipes and bats they just get up and start running like nothing happened. Not just in this series but in just about every Korean movie or series. It\\'s kind of comedic after a while.,This was a major disappointment for me, as the premise and promise of Yoo Ah In was very exciting and enticing. The story ended up being just okay, it was certainly interesting to see how humans strive to put meaning to unfathomable occurrences, and we see this reflected in real life too. Unfortunately after episode 3 the show grew boring, and it was just the same thing over and over again. The show ended with an interesting twist, I wish they had put that twist in episode 4 and used it to flesh out the rest of the show. Unfortunately this show turned out to be a violent, chaotic mess with no real reasoning or answers provided. I think a season 2 is highly unlikely, so as an audience we will probably never receive answers, which is annoying and disappointing. I would definitely pass on this one.,Overall it was pretty good. Liked the concept, although at times the speech was a tad too repetitive. There were better off making 20min episodes instead in my opinion as some scenes just dragged on and on.,After seeing the cgi monsters i was like wtf it looks like some anime but that\\'s where you gotta love these korean shows even though i hated those monsters looking kinda outta shape i expected something scarier than a golem but hey each one have their own imaginations. The character development and cult story arc was perfect .Waiting for season 2.,The creatures are creative, new idea but directorship and story are too lacking. There are lots of nonsense no logic story especially conclusion in episode 6.Nonsense that the lady lawyer wont die and later become a super fighter stronger than man after short years. The baby video at the courtyard also did not proof to the people that he is a sinner. More over the baby did not burn is totally nonsense when the heat is so immense. Another nonsense that the guy beat at manignoring his job, while the cop also ignored his duty and arrest that man. The director is a 3rd rate and knows nothing about reality.There also lots of minor problems no logic in this drama. Although its short 6 episodes, there were too many illogical story because in 2021, dramas in Korea had improved so much but yet this one is still so problematic.I am also relieve that its only 6 episodes because it is very lacking of story points. However they will make a season 2 because they are too self-confident that they will succeed highly.,10 outta 10? That cant be, guys. I don\\'t see anything original in the story. And seriously even the CG is mediocre. Thriller? Na, not plenty. Jump scares? Pretty much none. The opening chasing scenes did made me laugh though (hence to me it more like a comedy). It\\'s an average Korean series that is okay for someone to kill a boring night or two. I watched it coz my friend told me that many people have rated it 10/10. Heck, that must be a joke. That what friends are for!In the name of honesty I shall never recommend it to anyone, not a long shot.,Hellbound is quite an interesting show. The show might say about itself that it\\'s about demons claiming human souls and dragging them to hell. But actually the focus is on humans and their lust for power and what dogmatic thinking and power structures will do to a society.Yes there are these creatures that will kill humans in pretty horrific ways after they receive their death messages. Still this in the first season is more of a side aspect as there are groups and characters that try to use it to drive their own agendas.This is also proven by the way people speak. The death messages the victims receive are called \"decrees\" and the killing by these creatures is always named as \"demonstration\" (of god\\'s will).Fact of the matter is though that throughout the episodes there are a lot of unanswered questions and new questions always pop up - especially at the end of episode 6.The first season is actually split into two sections (episode 1-3 and 4-6) where you can say that both sections are basically a movie on their own. Between both \"movies\" there is also a shift in terms of main characters. Episodes 1-3 have different leads compared to episodes 4-6 and some characters from the first part only play a secondary role in the later episodes.I heard some people complain that the acting is bad but I disagree. The acting is actually pretty good overall. But I\\'ve been watching the show in Korean with English subtitles. So I\\'m hearing the original actors voices and from what I can tell they are doing a very good job.With some of the things happening in the story I\\'ve been thinking whether or not the writers wanted to draw some parallels to what has been happening with Covid and the vaccines (\"be a good citizen and get the shot or you may get god\\'s punishment ==> covid\"). But I can\\'t say that for sure and it may only be my own interpretation.Anyway I\\'d recommend to give Hellbound a chance.,After a fairly slow start I started to really enjoy it and as TV series go it\\'s one of the better ones.It\\'s a very interesting series and had they pitched the idea of the series to me I couldn\\'t have seen how it would work... and yet work it does!The only troubling part for me was the end of the series... as these South Korean films/series do... they tend to cross the line for me and in this instance it was with the baby.7 out of 10. Recommended.,Netflix is back with another Korean web series as Hellbound started streaming barely a week back. The success of Squid Game must have prompted the makers to go online with the product which mostly appears to be hastily made, hurriedly edited, and forcefully given the final look without even thinking of a fitting finale. Maybe that is the reason they halted in the midway and paved the way for a sequel series as they did not have a proper plan on where to take the story.Even though the show has enough pace to sustain for six long episodes, the logic behind making such a show is barely understood. Has Netflix gone mad after minting money with Squid Game, that it forgot to even review what they are showing? Even they did not bother to lip-sync the English dubbed version and in most of the scenes, the quality of dubbing resembles those dubbed movies back in the \\'80s.Character portrayal is ludicrous, camera works half-hearted, editing poor and acting over the top. This is in a nutshell, the review of this odd show. In the scenes where the Arrowhead YouTuber appears, you feel like damning yourself against the TV screen. The principles of The New Truth Society are watery thin and those are annoyingly self-contradictory. The horror value is so imbecile that you may recall those cheap, poorly made zombie movies made when you were a toddler. Even they did not hesitate to hire the VIP scene from the Squid Game, so low they stooped to in the rush of making a web series just for the sake of keeping the Squid Game hype alive. Normally this type of show thrives on the CGI values which keep you glued to the screen. Unfortunately, Hellbound comes with the weakest CGI I have watched in recent times on Netflix.Avoid this nonsense joke. Spend your hard-earned time on something more meaningful on Netflix. And do not go by the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. IMDB this time is closer to the truth.My Review- 4 out of 10Available on- Netflix.,This is really good. SK is knocking it out of the park on Netflix. Effects are good, story is intriguing...the English dubbing is much better than Squid Game, although the police lingo translation can be a bit comical. Regardless, Definitely recommend...excellent cult/supernatural drama.,The premise is brilliant but the story was dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. It is hard to believe no police force or political leader dared to challenge Fascist gangs led by a Youtube personality in blacklight makeup. Koreans are apparently made of stone and are immune to massive head trauma.I wish it better explored backstories of people burned alive by interdimensional beings. Also, does no other country in the world exist to react to these happenings?Entertaining, but not as nuanced as Snowpiercer or Squid Game for social commentary.,Hellbound is a dragged-about-through-the-muck, lackluster attempt at horror. While it is, at times, gory (a little too gory, really) it especially drags between the scenes in which poor souls are dragged about by those oversized, grey gorillas.None of what happens has any meaning. Whether that\\'s classified as existential or nihilistic, either way it\\'s always bleak in an unfulfilling way.My family bought into the reviews claiming the naysayers don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about. But alas, the naysayers got it right. Korea does put out more consistently good quality entertainment than Hollywood, but they spit out some duds as well. Nobody can escape it entirely.HB is watchable, but our opinion is that it\\'s not worth the time nor the effort. This is not Squid Game, in which there\\'s shocking violence, with some blood and the like, but no gross-out gore. Squid Game, furthermore, has no gratuitous violence: It all reinforces the horror that society creates when it\\'s \"Every man for himself.\" Kingdom is another horror offering out of Korea that\\'s done exceptionally well, with nothing feeling out of place.HB seems to have nothing in place. The plot twists don\\'t pack enough of a wallop. The plot pivot at the halfway mark is strange, with neither half of the show being wrapped up completely. There are some likable characters, but they drift away, rather than find any permanent resting place.HB\\'s worst sin is that it\\'s boring. It did not hold the interest of anybody in my family, and we\\'re Kdrama fans. We stuck with it, as that\\'s our habit, and we also kept hoping something would pull it all together. Abandon hope. Nothing gets pulled together. It could actually be by design, in order to underscore a nihilist theme. By saying that there is design is as generous as I can be. It\\'s entirely possible that there\\'s none. It\\'s difficult to tell.Having said all the above, HB is still superior to most of Hollywood\\'s horror offerings which depress the IQ, and heighten sadistic indifference in the viewer. HB absolutely will not do that: Your IQ is safe from being dragged down by it, and your sense of empathy will not be preyed upon by it. HB has some truly good elements that were left unreconciled in a string of missed opportunities. That\\'s what fans of the show have likely connected with.As a piece of horror, HB\\'s around a 7/10, but in entertainment value alone, it\\'s in the neighborhood of 5.5 - 5.9, and definitely under a 6. My son was emphatic about that.Unfortunately for HB, after being starved of quality entertainment for too long, Kdramas shocked our systems with quality overload. Now our standards have shot up heavenward.If blood&guts is your jam, HB is gory. In fact, it\\'s uncomfortably so. There\\'s only a half dozen or so such scenes, however, none of the deaths are quick, and all of them are tortuous.We are new enough to K-entertainment that we haven\\'t seen many horror pieces. As previously mentioned, Kingdom and Squid Game are far superior to HB. Tunnel is a cop show involving a serial killer, so it isn\\'t far from horror, and Tunnel is excellent. Black is another police/fantasy drama that is quite close to horror. It\\'s depicted on screen, but even more so, there\\'s horror of the mind. Black is a profound work with no wasted dialogue: Almost every line connects to another element in the show, building a complex work of art. If you aren\\'t sure what to watch next, those should not disappoint.HB is a big letdown -pun intended. Repent, turn back, and save yourself from the mediocre forces that will definitely drag your evening down, if you give in to them.Quote:~It seems that none of us have the right to make decisions for ourselves.~IMHO...\\r\\n🎬7 🤔5 ⚡8 🎭7\\r\\nSuggested Age 16& up.,Its another freaking cop/detective show with demons maybe every blue moon yet people are praising it cause its from Korea.Yeah.. no its a joke especially considering people are claiming its by the people who made Train to Busan; more than likely its made by the people who made its sequel.,I was mostly cold watching it and waiting for it to pick up . I managed to get to the end and i am now very curious to see what happens next. Korean dramas usually have 16 to 20 episodes so I am guessing they did with this one like they did with Kingdom and divide it in two parts. I was expecting more for the first part but I am hoping it will compensate in the second .For the rest, the show is well made, great acting ( Yoo Ah-in is just chameleonic in everything he does) . The effects are outstanding, the quality of the series is evident and the concept is very original. It just lacks pace and thrill, most of the time but we will see what happens next.,I gave this a 10 not because it\\'s worth a 10 but it shows excellently why religion (in this case Catholicism) is a crock of s.... as performed by mankind. I don\\'t know if the writers were aiming to show Christianity in this light. Turn the other cheek..er no not this lot. Love thy neighbour...er not this lot. Thou shall not kill er....not this lot etc etc etc. The series shows quite well the vigilantism and stupidity of people as they watch others condemned (supposedly) to hell but then go and do the exact thing that will send them to hell!! Maybe I\\'m thinking deeper than the writers intended. Maybe it\\'s a yarn about monsters? Anyhoo I found it very entertaining in that respect.,The Koreans are knocking out some great TV ATM, some better than others. First up, just want to put it out there, I hated Squid Game. Probably not a trendy thing to say, but just found it very sadistic, unlikeable characters, and no real storyline. Boring, repetative pointless. So if you enjoyed that, you might not enjoy this. Hellbound is in a whole different league. It is more of a proper horror series. It does have a fairly straightforward storyline, just throw in a handful of hellish monsters, a manipulative internet cult (aren\\'t they all?), and some death premonitions. There are some truly horrific and gory scenes scattered throughout the series, but I think what I most enjoyed, was the gritty realism. I know when you\\'re dealing with these sorts of topics, realism is a relative term. But in this show everyday life continues around the bizarre unfolding events.,Really enjoyed this romp through the supernatural. Some death premonitions, hell creatures, a twisted god/death cult. People are confronted by visions that tell them when they arte going to die. There aresome twists and turns along the way. It has the usual bizarre subplots you expect from a Korean movie. But for those whos thought Squid Game was an overated piece of trash, you might enjoy this,,Massive plot twists, impressive set pieces, urgent pacing and a unique narrative structure. Raised by Wolves and Hellbound are the only two tv series that truly shows you how religion is the ultimate evil in our world , and the absolute disgusting stupidity and irrational behavior of humans. IF you advocate for things like Reason, Evidence and critical thinking, then this show will comfort your intellectuality.,This series should\\'ve been much shorter, the last three episodes were the core of this series. I felt that they stretched the series too much, the first three episodes could\\'ve been much shorter and the whole series can be actually made into a movie with two and half hours run time.The series ends in a decent way telling people that there will be a season 2.,Korea is putting out more quality entertainment than Hollywood these days for the simplest of reasons, no agenda, and this offers what Hollywood movies used to, escapism.Most rational people want to watch a series or movie just to unwind and lose themselves in a good story for a few hours without being beaten over the head with wokeness, and Korea gets that.Now don\\'t get me wrong, Hellbound, or Jiok, has it\\'s flaws. It\\'s very slow and meandering at times, there was an action scene where they won the shaky cam award of the year, some characters just vanish after the time jump with no explanation, but it did it\\'s job of keeping me watching.Hopefully there will be a second season as it does end on a very interesting cliffhanger.Recommended as long as you have a good attention span.,The concept is interesting and original yet the plot is so badly executed... it feels like 3 episodes would be enough... when things started to be interesting again it was over.... CGI are just good... in some cases they are really bad!. Still waiting for the 2nd season maybe they will do a better job!,Amazing boring probably the worst Korean series ever watched. Tasteless, meaning less, story less it was less in everything. Don\\'t waste your time, you will be highly disappointed. Still don\\'t know why it was in Netflix.. Netflix should watch 1st then put it.. What a crape.,There is speciality in K-drama is its always have something that suprised and kind of new .the supernatural part in story is small but reaction of humans in it is amazing , its a must watch series,action scenes are missing otherwise its must watch series.,Nessa analise me baseei em 5 importantes pontos: Enredo, desenvolvimento, personagens, estética e entretenimento.Enredo: 1/2.Desenvolvimento: 0/2.Estética: 0/2.Personagens: 1/2.Entretenimento: 0/2.,The trailer and all the hype created by media on this made it a definitely watch for me. The 1st episode didn\\'t disappoint and it peaked my interest.However things fell flat after 2nd episode. The story completely stopped making sense and the way it was progresses was just boring and not enjoyable at all. I finished it anyways since it was only 6 episodes but this was just bad, very bad experience.,One of the original and thought-provoking shows I have ever seen. It is dark, brutal, sensitive, engaging, religious, and philosophical. It talks about how humans can be so worst when it comes to being successful. Though some may find it boring as it is not for everyone. The climax blows your mind with \\'WTF?\\'. Can not wait for season 2. Highly recommended! ❤,When you think of the billions of people in the world and how they all came to believe the same religions based quite often on books and hear say from prophets both old and new. Its quite astounding the investment in money, time and space in their thoughts that people give over to something that technically isn\\'t provable. Christianity etc. This show looks at what happens if events in the modern age were to occur, supernatural/relgious and with the wide use of photography and video, how would the world react. Should people with proof via video and proof from their own eyes simply bow down to new religious orders that pop up? Or should they ignore their doctrines and stand against any religion or supernatural entities judgement on their lives? This questions asks a lot of interesting hypotheticals and plays with them in an amazing fashion. Not to give much away of the plot, apart from saying that 3 creatures start coming into the world and bringing death upon apparent sinners who have been warned of their death prior to it occuring via the prophecies of supposed angels. It stirs up amazing questions of free will, the god question, separation of church and state and how the media should be neutral to hardline religious values and doctrineThe show has a great pace over 6 episodes and it feels longer than it was, but in a good sense as nothing felt rushed and there were excellent payoffs. I would recommend it for anyone who likes science fiction or perhaps a bit of philosophy in their shows. The acting was very good as was the special effects. Another great show from Netflix so soon after Squid Game from South Korea. 10/10. Couldn\\'t recommend it any higher.,I like slow burners for psycological thrillers, but a sci-fi fantasy like this needs better pace. It is still worth the watch though. The acting was good, and Korean films and shows in gemeral have really been picking up the last couple of years.,The execution is slow & boring. The first 10 minutes of episode one started of very good but then there is just talk talk talk & a 10 min scene you\\'ve been waiting for to happen. Still the idea was interesting & the acting is pretty good that give you a reason to watch another episode. But the Arrowhead guy was so annoying af man!.. And Stop comparing this to Squid Game this is nowhere near.,Very entertaining original story. Shame only 6 episodes. What happened to the detective from the first part of the series? Good to see a female in a strong lead role. Really enjoyed have no idea what is going especially with the ending I mean WTf! Can\\'t wait for S2.,Hellbound was re-released on the comics platform Webtoon as the show aired on Netflix. I didn\\'t know neither the comic nor the show, and it didn\\'t seem like what I\\'d usually read on the platform.I gave the show a try, and it made me curious about the comic.The comic is way darker than the show so far, but the show is not as bad as what some reviews suggest. Yes, the execution might seem a bit flat and slow at times, but it also depends whether you watch the show in Korean with subtitles, or dubbed. The Korean version is much better. They also have many characters to introduce in just a few episodes, so the storyline might lack speed in the first two episodes.The story is about us, humans, paying for our sins, and mystical creatures descending on Earth to make us atone for our sins. It criticizes the inefficiency of our judicial systems, and whether humans can truly just other humans for their crimes and sins. It makes me wonder whether all sins should be judged the same: to be sentenced to Hell, as the story may suggest.Watch out for the acting of who plays Jeong Jin-soo, that I find terrifying. 😱 He seems to be able to show such a twisted mind. Who is the real evil?One giant miss: the creatures (grim reapers?) seem to have a much more twisted and sadistic personality in the comic.,So take Warrior Nun tv, Death Note manga, and Save Me kdrama; then combine them together. And you have Jiok/Hellbound.The concept is really interesting. Especially when it is combined with the character building, drama, and handling of death. It honestly feels like a extended metaphor on how humans in the past, used to sacrifice virgins. In order to please the ocean gods from Tsunami\\'s and other natural disasters.However, its GREATEST weakness. Which many shows suffer from now in days (I\\'m looking at you Jupiter\\'s Legacy). Is being way too long and drawn out for the story they are trying to tell. 6 of one hour episodes did not suit this. Instead, 3 OVAs/Movies would be better. 1st ending on the death of the original chairman of the religious cult. 2nd ending with the parents protecting their baby from being hell bound. 3rd OVA/Movie can then close the cliffhanger.Speaking of which-another knock against Hellbound-it ends on a cliffhanger. By bringing one of the hellbound-victims back from the supposed hell. They would have been better off leaving it open ended. With the lawyer and baby driving off with the Taxi man, saying that \"man should determine their own fate and how they live/die.\" Because I don\\'t see how this gets green-lite another season.If it did, I could see it turn into some sort of alien vs human battle, and that would be pretty cool.,It\\'s very interesting I wanted answers and that kept me going. After 6 episodes I have even more questions and my mood is ruined.So many tragedies and brutal scenes, it was literally awful to watch, I hated watching it, but curiosity kept me going.It was a beautiful day today. Sunny. I should have went outside, bake a cake or something! Instead, I wasted my Sunday, and I feel bad.,I won\\'t lie, episode 1-3 are boring because in my opinion the writers failed in introducing the story, be as it may I myself wouldn\\'t pull it in 2 episodes given that you have to introduceReligion, politics & conspiracy in 60mins and on top of that you have to bake us with developing characters so we know who is who and why we hate or like them.Episode 1-4 &6 summarise 80% of the whole season if you don\\'t care about character development.If ever there will be a 2nd season, I urge the writers to go deeper & hard on the subjects.In this season they played over the surface and we had no time to even think deep but to agree or disagree here & there.,There\\'s quite a lot to say about Hellbound and it requires me to both watch my language and to hit the spoilers tag.Because dang it if this didn\\'t do a lot. Little of it brilliantly, quite a bit lacking and a lot badly.Let\\'s get things out of the way, what we can expect to happen in the next few years (written Dec 21) is to have what appear to be demons randomly attacking people for no apparent reason and killing them. That sort of makes perfect sense when you think of how things have been going, it\\'s a \"yeah that might as well happen.\"But to be serious, we have an intriguing plot \"things appear, say people are going to hell, other things appear and burn them to death.\" and a single incident ensues that sends the world into a tailspin of nightmarish overreaching religious zealotry where people will throw their own families to the dogs just because they \"think\" they are \"sinners\".It\\'s an excellent premise and it\\'s what kept me hooked for the full run.BUT.Oh lord did this series go all over the place, from the first set of episodes where everything is set up, from Jin Kyung-hun trying to solve the case to his eventual fall and defeat to watch as Jung Jin-su is killed so he can save his daughter.Or the secondary plot where it\\'s jumped forwards 5 years and it\\'s now about a newborn baby about to be killed and the world is under the control of the New Truth.Or the side plot about Min Hye-jin at first being a lawyer (with apparent unlimited resources) that somehow survives a brutal gangland beating to become an underground leader of a subversive army that works against the New Truth to hide the deaths.This story could\\'ve been done better being stretched out, season 1\\'s 6 episode run for the build up of the reveal that Jung Jin-su is just another victim and is clinically insane but has built a cult around that insanity.Leading into season 2 where everything\\'s gone to heck and a handbasket and everything is worse, leading to the reveal stinger for a season 3.Add to this quickly boiled over plot that doesn\\'t give the viewer time to breathe and add the all over there plots that either don\\'t go anywhere or are useless to the narrative.This failed terribly to do a decent job.Is it a good series? No, not really, I didn\\'t find myself enjoying anything, the dub is - as always - horrendous, the story makes zero sense in context, Jung Jin-su was the first ever chosen for this, and it was 20 years? Why? What is the face and why is it doing what its doing, the demons aren\\'t bothered with collateral damage but they\\'ll burn innocents if they are in the way of geting their actual target?Nope, not good.I give it just over 5 stars for the premise, the decent enough effects for a Korean show, the acting for SOME of the cast and the commentary of how cults are built.But this was a mistake, I\\'ll never watch this series again.,It\\'s a decent show, I liked it. It was pretty darn brutal though, which got tiring (for me) at times, never boring though. Then, by the end, what I thought would, or might, happen, didn\\'t, and I\\'m really looking forward to season 2 now. It\\'s a bit cheesy in the very beginning but that passes, and you can really tell that they put a lot of money into the effects.It\\'s definitely not for everyone but it does have a good payoff for those that stick with the 6 episodes.,I have only a mild interest in K-dramas. My usual reservations are artificially extended running time, inconsistencies, and soap opera-like abundance of romance, usually because of the studio executives meddling.Hellbound seems to have allowed Yeon Sang-ho (the director) run with his concept, and implement it just the way he wanted.Hellbound is mesmerizing on several levels. It paints an unflattering picture how ideologies and organised religions rise to power, but also does not scrimp on action (mostly brutal and disturbing). People complaining about the slow pacing probably just wanted to see a horror flick about monsters. Hellbound is more than that, and the pacing is just right: enough to tell the story, but not long enough to bore the viewer.The acting is great as expected, and the way the story is broken in two arcs, also works very well. The violence is over the top at times, but it does not detract from the story, and enhances it.The twists are really unexpected, and so far, keep making sense. I do hope more will be explained in Season 2.,I really like a lot of the movies the director has made, but can\\'t say I really enjoyed this show. First off, there\\'s no mystery as to the supernatural phenomenon that\\'s happening, we get told about it straight away in the first episode and that\\'s it. It would have been more compelling to frame it in a way where we as the audience are also not sure of whether they are real or not. Also, the message of the show seems to be a verryyyy heavy-handed \"Cults and/or groupthink is bad\", which sure, I get it, that\\'s pretty dang obvious.The villains are also just so one-dimensionally evil, like the main deacon who seems to have no character arc other than following the cult leader despite abuse. Then you have the arrowhead punk members who believe the demons go after sinners so they, uh, beat and kill people? Yeah, logic is also not this show\\'s strong suite. In the third episode, the main cult leader gives a long speech to the detective about how people interpret the phenomenon that was honestly so hard to follow that I wondered if someone had messed up the subtitles/translation.It\\'s a shame, because the premise is really interesting, but the execution is just so bland it just comes off as a very surface level condemnation of blindly believe in corrupt authority figures, without bringing us any closer to understanding the phenomenon.,For me it was okay as a short series; good CGI and the acting was fair.If \"God\" is selecting \"sinners\" why weren\\'t any of the current Cult leaders and staff called for demonstration? The original head-honcho had 20 years to get his death in order, but the rest...nada. Also, wouldn\\'t there be millions of \"sinners\" torched across the globe?It was an entertaining, although repetitive series, predictable and six episodes was enough.,First of all the concept is really intriguing and I think it could have been executed well. This is a massive disappointment especially considering the hype and promotion it had. The plot is just so idiotic and most of the times the characters decisions don\\'t make any sense. If you\\'re going into this expecting some train to busan type thriller, you\\'ll be in for great disappointment. The acting and CGI is also very shoddy. The backdrop somewhat makes it bearable but overall, it\\'s a no from me. Only plus point is that you can binge watch it fast since only 6 episodes.,...it gets slow and (for me) much less exciting. Pity actually.The killing scenes are very violent again, as often found in films from S. Korea. Lots of (endless) talk about God, hell, punishments, sins etc. But after the promising intro in episode one very little action afterwards.Sorry, but after the intro in the first episode and the wild chase, I expected much much more. Turned it off during episode 03, season 01.,You start out watching the show thinking \\'this is what it is and what it will be\\'...but...then things change...and change.Really, really well written show and can\\'t wait for more seasons.,The korea fanboys and girl are celebrating everything that is korean. Dont listen to them. Its not that good and overrated. Not like squid game (squid game was awesome) but this is a big F.,My expectation was a little bit high manly because of the trailer, but the show is very well-scripted and well-paced, so it didn\\'t disappoint me much. You would be surprised to find that there\\'s no any \"fat\" in this show. Even when the pace is slow, it doesn\\'t drag. It shows the right amount of what viewers need to see from one another which also proves that the show is very well-edited. I watched all 6 episodes in one sitting. The last episode is truly a masterpiece.Now cons, the biggest problem I\\'ve had was that actors and actresses look too generic. I don\\'t watch many korean shows, but I don\\'t think this is usual thing by korean shows standard. Maybe the show\\'s creator intended to hire everyday people looking actors who I can see them on the public transportation or grocery stores. I don\\'t mind that if I watch documentary, but this show is for the entertainment. They should have employed actors who could enhance the characters by their own characteristic looks. The casting is the weakest one in this show. Also the cinematography is mediocre, and 6 episodes on 1 season is way too short. It feels like they took my dish away even though I only finished a half.P. S. I\\'m posting my review again because it was deleted somehow? I didn\\'t break any rules, but it was deleted. The only thing I noticed is that it was getting a lot of attention since I left an early review. I assume some people reported my review because I gave a good review on this show?,This is honestly one of the best shows. It has great acting, a great plot and story. The philosophical side to it and the meaning behind it is just phenomenal. The ending was very good too. A must watch.,The series is excellent; the way the events are presented is good; and I have to commend the work\\'s writing, which is flawless; and the characters are amazing; and I liked that the latest is divided into two chapters, the first three episodes and the last three episodes; however, the first episode is not very interesting, which is to be expected because it introduces the events, story, characters, and so on; but you must continue watching because after the first ep the events will become more exciting and intresting and I am very surprised because this work is not famous and it is underrated. And the end of it of course lead us to second season.,The initial concept is interesting--these people are \"selected\" to go to hell and told exactly what date and time that will happen. So then these 3 huge behemoths (hell creatures) appear out of nowhere and beat the crap out of the overly-conscious victims (I mean seriously, one bash in the head from those creatures and they would be knocked out). In fact, it was gratuitous, because if people know these creatures are coming, why don\\'t they take heroin or some drug that makes them immune to pain? Because these creatures don\\'t just send you to hell; they torture you first. But any human would quickly get knocked out by one punch, but instead, it shows them screaming until the very end. Gratuitous.OK, so then there\\'s this cult called \"Arrowhead\" that builds up, that believes these Hell creatures were sent by GOD and the message is to live \"more righteously\" (obviously, right?). I mean, if God revealed himself today, and started sending people to hell in the most graphic way, wouldn\\'t we all start turning into Christians overnight? You\\'d think so. But not this \"Arrowhead\" group! Their idea of \"living rightously\" apparently means to beat the crap out of (even to death) anyone who is...not like them! That\\'s right? They beat to death this old lady, only because she was with a lawyer woman whom was simply trying to do her job to protect some person (she never prevented the hell monsters). So they just go after the cop, too, and end up kicking him, like they\\'re full of hate. WHY?? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. If they were Christians, they would be doing the EXACT OPPOSITE and trying to be good, peaceful, meek people waiting for Judgment. But no, they listen to this Gilbert-Godfried-voiced annoying streamer guy with war-paint on his face, and it\\'s all about find out who the \"infidels\" (unbelievers are) and....beating them to a pulp! This happens so often, esp. In the 2nd and 3rd episode, I shut it off. I mean what\\'s the point?Besides this, the show was boring and missed opportunities. For example, the woman with 2 kids who was sent to hell--we never found out what her sins were! She\\'s just a working mom, so I was hoping the show would question our perceptions and show us how evil she was. But nobody figures out anything, yet the Arrowhead group are so convinced that she MUST have been an evil sinner regardless! The daughter of the cop gets roped in by the charm of the Arrowhead leader (the \"chairman\"), but then he convinces her to find and then jointly KILL the suspect in her mother\\'s murder? I was hoping they would show us that the old drunk man was innocent, but again, that plot point went nowhere. They just incinerate his body, and dump him into some field, I guess, as propaganda (why would they need it??). And why would she so willingly go along with murder? Stupid.Finally, we are to believe that a local police department is supposed to deal with these astounding incidents of hell monsters (on video!) beating and burning to death citizens? The feds never get involved? Just a local\\r\\npolice precinct? And those in that precinct are targeted and beaten up by the \"believers\"? The show thinks we are IDIOTS.This show is no Squid Game, that\\'s for sure.,It\\'s an overhyped series.1. It makes no sense. We\\'ve no idea what these monsters are or why they send people to hell until the very end.It\\'s implied that many of the hellbound people didn\\'t commit major SINS. What exactly are SINS in this context? Why are these poor people being thrashed & tortured? Even if they return at the end, the fact that they suffered greatly remains. So it\\'s clear that the supernatural force at work here isn\\'t righteous.2. People keep saying that this isn\\'t about monsters at all, but about society & human nature. I\\'m sorry, are we supposed to be astounded by the discovery that humans can be terrible? WE ARE ALREADY AWARE. This has been seen in everyday situations. The only new concept here is these massive yeti monsters. So don\\'t tell me it\\'s not about monsters transporting people to hell when the show is literally titled HELLBOUND & it\\'s very much about the freaking monsters.3. It\\'s heartbreaking & upsetting. When I say this, I don\\'t mean that I can\\'t deal with sadness. SQUID GAME had some heartbreaking scenes. TRAIN TO BUSAN did as well. Those two were absolute masterpieces. Hellbound shouldn\\'t be compared to them at all. I\\'m surprised at how many people say this is superior to SQUID GAME. In my opinion, No, it doesn\\'t. I feel mentally exhausted after watching this series.4. Now, let\\'s talk about the last episode. How exactly did the baby manage to survive? I was relieved that it was still alive, but come on. These monsters have huge rods for claws & a variety of contraptions ready to attack humans. You\\'re saying that these ruthless monsters couldn\\'t tear apart two fragile tiny people? What a farce.Overall, I\\'ve seen some bad shows, but this is one of the very few that I regret watching. I believe it has passed its redeeming value, & they will no longer be able to adequately explain it. But I\\'d be delighted to be proven wrong. Was it frightening? Yes, & it\\'s upsetting. What\\'s scarier is that it has a perfect rating on Rotten Tomatoes.I\\'m done. I just had to say all this.,So, waiting for the newborn to get kicked around by damnations fraternity team, otherwise, this is a pretty stupid concept for a show.There\\'s no logic to the story.,This show is hell. The concept is bizarre and should never have been put on screen. Watching each painfully drawn episode is worse than being incinerated by the demons.,This show is boring and poorly acted. Netflix canceled a awesome show The last kingdom for crap like this. Netflix has lost their minds. They need to stop putting this crap out.,For Me Hell Bound is such different show, and yet another fantastic series from Korea. But this time it\\'s not as engaging as they made. Only 6 episodes but we can not connect with each & every character aside from that Lawyer. The way they present is all about God and the New Truth who is working for God who punished only bad people it\\'s okay but they stretched all this in every episode. There areany questions which are unanswerable that how the god choose the perticular person for punishment? Is there any way to fight with Monsters? I don\\'t know, I think it\\'s all will be revel in season 2. Yes there are many thrilling moments. 1st live demonstration and the last one which was in last 30 mins that was quite thrilling and it\\'s shocking. For me it\\'s good watch!,The first 3 eps were good, but when act two started I lost interest. I endured to watch, but at the end of the sixth eps, I realized that eps 4, 5, and 6 could have been cut down to one eps and save the audience some pain. I\\'m sure there will be a series two, but I pray that they make it with less filler.,I\\'m not a huge fan of Korean TV shows. I\\'ve taken a look at a couple before end passed on them. But Hellhound is a different show by any standards. I\\'ll give you a waring though it is stressful to watch, it goes to place and put is characters through experiences and forces them into decisions that are uncomfortable to watch. It\\'s compelling and fast moving, perplexing and exhausting. Very original and quite violent. The violence though bloody is more shocking because of who it is being visited on and how rather then the violence itself. You won\\'t see a show like this anywhere else.,The first episode, as in everything, tends to be slow as characters are introduced, but...\\r\\nThis requires an attention span and once given and applying critical thinking you can easily see that this is a searing black satire on the state of the world, the power of the internet, people\\'s disinterest in the suffering of others as shown when a man when being torn apart everyone is more interested in filming the event on their phone.Some characterisation is a bit flat but that\\'s not the end of the world for this series.A compelling, thoughtful series that deserves a watch.It does make you wonder if this based around the Orange Peril no longer in office. Vigilante groups whipped up by the internet....,The story of the film uses a subject that, although repetitive, can always be interesting, but the slow process of the story and deviating from the main path in many parts of the film causes the viewer to become frustrated with the series too soon and to be boring. The use of poor special effects and incomplete criminal process are other weaknesses of the film. In general, despite the good subject, the film has not been able to expand the subject well, and it is surprising why such a large amount of publicity has been done on such a low-quality series.,I loved Midnight Mass. Here the premise is same as Midnight Mass but there are no preachy monologues and horror setting. But Hellbound is more violent than the former and is surprisingly bingeworthy. Other than the average VFX, all other departments are a big plus. Don\\'t expect this to be a yet another Squid Game and watch it without any expectations. You\\'d definitely like it.,Watched four episodes and nearly went into a coma... Very slow boring show with very little \"hell\" action and it\\'s the same 3 bad CGI demons that appear... The image and trailers make it look very interesting and watchable! Don\\'t be fooled by this.,This show received some positive reviews, so I decided to watch. Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t go beyond episode 2. BORING!I admit that the show started off cool in the very beginning, with the monsters and the police who seek to investigate. But thereafter, the show starts swerving and weaving in so many directions: there is focus on some religion cult, there are random scenes of some weird guy with a goat-mask on his head, there is some material concerning a detective\\'s relationship with his daughter etc. The characters just start talking and talking and talking, and I found myself losing interest.I don\\'t know what the show was aiming for, and I have no interest in sticking around to find out. Avoid this show, trust me.,This show deaserves atleast 9 giving 10 to balance negative reviews everything in this show was thrilling and exciting dont know why people don\\'t like this.Just watch it and decide for yourself.,We all know it\\'s an interesting concept, but they failed to give us something to hold on to. Basically, you have no positive or good characters/deeds to carry our attention, nothing to care for. At episode 3 i am watching this show with zero attachments just to see if anything interesting happens . And It doesn\\'t! Sure, you see just how easy it is to scare people into submission when something they can\\'t explain appears. And they all go into stupid mode. But we see that every day now. And that\\'s something this show failed to deliver, a good positive balance to the story. This was just depressing throughout, with just a little bit of \"positive\" at the very end, but that wasn\\'t enough to save this series. I will not waste my time with season 2, at best, i am going to look for explanations online and be done with it, just satisfy my curiosity.,Despite some weak points, this show addresses many social, political, religious, media and moral issues quite brilliantly.The most obvious one is the religious theme - angels, demons, god, hell, etc. I thought some of the terminologies and concepts could be more abstract, otherwise it\\'s too close to some of the existing religions, as a result, it may confine people to think about issues such as existentialism and morality through the lens of this or that religion, instead of thinking about them in a more open manner. The show is also a study on the frequently recurring contradictions between what people believe they\\'re supposed to do and their ultimate deeds.I\\'m surprised few reviewers - even professional ones - mention references to the dictators in North Korea. Some nods to dictators - such as the giant murals in the New Truth building - are painfully obvious. Dictators and cult leaders are kind of two sides of the same coin, they bend the narrative, manipulate the public viewpoints, and filter what gets out to people. The show also reflects how some of the dictators could be immensely flawed - to say the least - and sometimes even dumb, yet they still have numerous followers, many of whom are intelligent, at their command. Human psychology is fascinating.Another interesting aspect of the show is about determinism and punishment. We often think we have free will, but how often do we have control over what happens to us, what we\\'re thinking, and how much our actions will influence what will unfold. And if we don\\'t have control over such matters, do we have free will? And who and how should someone gets be punished? Who gets to be the judge?The Arrowheads and social media are obvious reflections of our contemporary issues - addiction to screens, fake news, overconsumption, etc. I thought much more context could be given to the Arrowhead hooligans - how did they get to be so radicalized? It\\'s an opportunity to draw ideas from extreme nationalist/supremacist/far-right ideologies. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s a commentary on how our society has become passively complicit in crimes or just bad scriptwriting, but the scenes where bystanders are doing nothing when someone\\'s trying to harm a baby or beating up an old man are, sad yes, but also inexplicably bizarre.It\\'s my opinion that the artistic direction could be much less pedestrian, everything from when the snow falls, the soundtrack, how people interact with technology... could be much more imaginative. I know maybe they want the show to be rooted in realism, but when you already have CGI demons... you can veer away from exact carbon copy of our reality a little more.In short, Hellhound is one of the few mainstream shows that has the audacity to tackle many hard problems that plague our contemporary world head-on. However, I wish it would act more than just a mirror of our problems and present the underlying and often not-so-obvious causes. Also, alas, it suffers a little from overambition, there\\'s only that much you can show in 6 episodes. Any one of the themes that they touch on can be the basis of a whole separate series. But it\\'s perhaps great news for anyone with a short attention span - they can consume a maximum amount of materials within a minimum amount of time.,I really don\\'t understand the negative reviews about this.I thought it was a great series - visually impressive with good acting from the main cast. There were enough interesting concepts to keep up the intrigue and whilst the direction of some of the plot points were fairly obvious it was still done in an engaging way.Some people have mentioned characters and settings not being realistic, but apart from the suspense of disbelief that has to occur regarding the main premise of the show, I think that\\'s part of the style. Whether it\\'s representative of South Korean film making or not I am in no position to say - however, those saying it\\'s boring must have the attention span of a gnat.It was an interesting move splitting the story into two parts and overall I think it worked well. I particularly liked the link between the nutty Arrowhead guy who did the live streaming and the final episode.The ending suggests that there may be the potential for a second season. I hope so, as I\\'d like to see where this goes.,This series makes a hell of a lot of sense if you clearly open your eyes to the world we live in today. Religion and Government play a big part of lives as well as social media.Script was absolute genius to include so much of religious and political drama going on nowadays.To me, this is a masterpiece series and best in 2021.,This is a strange one. A philosophical \\'horror\\' series which takes enough time (slow burn) to give us fleshed out characters, a brilliant storyline with incredible brutal intermezzos (and hopefully a second season)Not for everyone. For some it could be too bloody (and I would definitely don\\'t recommend it for children !) , for some it could be too slow with not enough flashy things every single second, for some it will be not \\'diverse\\' and \\'woke\\' enough. But I loved it. A thought provoking horror.Another winner from Korea. Hollywoke has deserted us so other countries are filling the void and Korea is probably the frontrunner at the moment.,I\\'m not sure I would call this show a horror, unless you consider organised religion a horror. Actually, come to think of it, I kinda do.Anyway, this show wasn\\'t to my taste as it was about how religious zealots try to control people, rather than a supernatural horror. It was moderately interesting but just felt like a cheap network TV show. Oh, and the annoying YouTuber really grated. I literally had to mute the volume when he appeared and stick with subtitles only.,One of the mixed bag things about Korean dramas is that they often are a big allegory. While not necessarily a bad thing, sometimes, like in this one, it gets too caught up in the analogy and forgets it still needs a vessel in which to carry its message. This vessel unfortunately sprung a leak and ran dry. As a result, and perhaps because it has themes clearly not intended for a US audience it loses both relevance and impact. Basically, its boring. It\\'s hella boring. The first episode is ok. And frankly that\\'s all you really needed. Nothing else really meaningful happens. Like a lot of Netflix content, a movie would\\'ve worked better than a series. Brevity is the soul of wit. It\\'s not horrible, it\\'s well produced after all but it\\'s also a clear coat tail rider on the recent popularity of Korean dramas and one we absolutely could\\'ve done without.,For such a graphic and imaginative subject the script writers have managed to create absolutely no tension or characters with an degree of depth. Sorry I really wanted to enjoy another quality S Korean series but this is certainly not one of them.,My first Asian show. I watched it and I enjoyed it. You have to look at it as if you\\'re Korean, not American to enjoy it.The death angels were badass I was surprised at those who died.,Yeon Sang-ho had a good premis here from hies original webtoon that he created a while ago. And so many peoplw liled it to the idea of him making it into a full 6episodes show.But the thing is...the show didnt ...hit anything..its as if its aiming at 10 different targets and not hitting each one spot on...\\r\\nand in the end leaves more questions opned then answered and truthfully doesnt even answer any question...its like it has a tiny present of elements of suspense ...but nothing like train to bussan or other tv shoes where ur at the age of your seat...\\r\\nthe show is mostly.dialogs and the suspense moments are one or two short scenes an episodeits like it has horror elements..but really there is literely very littpe to none scarry monents here where i said i couldnt sleep after...it was suppose (based on webtoons video) to be this detective finding the \"truth\" about this beings...and sinners and whats actually going on...are they real ? Technology ? Is someone controlling them ?But no...no one is investigating that... no one is trying to answer that and even the show dont show any...\"real\" reason for all of thisfinally they could also go to direction of action packed like..how would they go ahead hunting this same three creatures appearing...\\r\\nand even though there is usualy a handfull of officers / guns... when they appear...literely no one is looking to how to destroy or kill them...lastly the thing korean shows have best is drama...\\r\\nthats the last strew that i said ok maybe its a drama show. But again\\r\\ni didnt care too much of any of this charechters enough..with all that cult / charechter / etc... you dont have enough time to invest enough in this charechters to have touching moments...\\r\\nno love theme between any of them...no emotions that is like...you sinply dont get attached..train to bussan also directed by same guy was a masterpiece...\\r\\nof emotions...drama..action..and suspensebut in here...mostly i think becaouse its hies project he was so excited he tried to hit 100 ideas that popped in hies headand in movies when you try to show too much stuff..ot never gives a good moviein the end episode there is some more open questions ..which i didnt care for really at that point ...\\r\\ni dont know if this will recieve a season twoi hope it will and in next season just focus more twards 2 or so targets...back to basics of story telling.,This is a great short series and done very well. Interesting characters and plot and well worth a look if you liked Squid Game. Reading some of the negative reviews in here, it would seem there are a lot of religious folk who have become very triggered by the series. The incredible irony is that they\\'ve completely missed the point of the entire show! 😂😂😂,I was truly looking forward to the latest work by director Yeon Sang-ho. I enjoyed Train to Busan very much and his drama \"The Cursed\" is one of my favorite from the past couple of years. Mr. Yeon certainly has his own world of zombies and the paranormal, and as with some of his work, many have been thrilled to go along with the ride. Unfortunately, this isn\\'t one of his best. The convoluted storyline, frenzied action scenes, and poorly developed character backgrounds make this a very turbulent ride. There\\'s no point in giving any summary of the story. Unlike some of his finer works, where you didn\\'t want to get off the train even after it had arrived at the final destination, this made you want to jump off the train midway through. There was no denying the feeling that I had gotten on the wrong train after the first couple of episodes. It\\'s a shame.,All the lead characters are miserable -- not bad actors, but miserable characters.The story, unlike most K-dramas, is utterly lacking in charm. It\\'s dismal, sanctimonious, preachy, melodramatic, and worst of all, extremely difficult to believe. Not the monsters -- if you\\'ve seen the previews, then you\\'ll know whether you like them or not. I thought they were fine. It\\'s the REST of the show that\\'s hard to believe. Everything is completely over the top: crowds of people suddenly turning on the main characters, main leads getting roped into the story in multiple ways, etc. It\\'s just bad, lazy writing.The monologues seem like they will never end. In four episodes, they never _did_ end. I assume the final two eps have more of the same.My wife and I really like Korean dramas. We\\'ve watched dozens of them, including crazy fantastical stuff like Strangers from Hell, Kingdom, Park Il DOH, and also more standard police procedurals like Beyond Evil. K-dramas are great. We love K-dramas.But we just couldn\\'t finish this. It wasn\\'t abysmally awful, but it was definitely a turn-off.,The trailer looked cool. Nervous guy is in a coffee shop, the time changes to 1:20 and three huge smoke monsters crash through the windows, chase this guy down, beat the crap out of him and send him to hell. Great special effects & acting, so what could go wrong? Well, for the first 4 episodes (which are all I made it through), the smoke monsters rarely make an appearance. Instead the focus is on this doomsday cult and it\\'s leader. Everybody just talks and talks and talks. The guy who said it picks up after episode 3, no it does not. I finally had enough of the boredom after episode 4. Maybe 5 and 6 are the best ever but good luck making it there.,Unique story , different taste to series universe.6no.s of eps first 4great going and the end of series 5&6eps story got Tangled. But one time okay to watch .Unearthly beings deliver condemnations, sending individuals to hell and giving rise to a religious group founded on the idea of divine justice.,The scariest aspect of this show is how terrible it is. The horror scenes are ludicrous and and the convoluted agenda makes no sense. There is absolutely no justification for how this movie received a 6.7 rating.,Although Christians, especially Catholics are one of the most persecuted groups throughout history, people still feel the need to demonize them and twist Christian belief. This has nothing to do with Christianity. If this were to happen we\\'d know this is now works of God. For Hell is not just physical damnation and hurt. Hell is the absence of God. The absence of anything good. Of love. No one can say for sure what it is really like, but we have an idea because it has been written throughout the ages. Nothing has waivered and all the prophecies of old have come true. We are told that we are not ones to judge others, unless we ourselves be judged first. To not cast a stone, unless we ourselves have never sinned. Christianity isn\\'t about damning others. It\\'s about loving others and forgiving. About true repentance of our own sins. Before acting like you know anything about Christianity and Theology, Apologetics, etc...Please try doing a little research. Please read St. Thomas Aquinas who is one of the worlds\\'s greatest philosophers and theologians. He was wrestling with the simple minded new Atheist movement\\'s dumb questions centuries ago. Please look up Jay Dyer on Youtube. You are some atheist who thinks your world view is locked and you know all the right answers, that shows how naive you are. You are not intelligent. You don\\'t know anything. You will someday though.The most ludicrous part of this show is the fact that they made the one woman character who is a lawyer just magically be able to start to beat up dozens of huge guys at a time. Like a super ninja. I find that more insane than the CGI and big creatures. She just throws around guys 3 times her size like nothing. It\\'s so stupid it hurts to even watch or think about. Feminism is a cancer. Look what it\\'s done to the West. Good job Korea in letting that cancer take hold in your country. Your fall will eventually come as well.,Excellent! The Korean film industry has proven once again that they far outstrip anywhere else for new and original stories. A bigger budget would have been nice. But frankly, it\\'s not necessary with good storey telling and excellent acting. The rest of the world could learn a thing or two from this rather than redoing the whole thing over again and pretending their version is the original. Loved the ensemble approach. It was absolutely necessary to tell this kind of storey.,Basically is a boring movie.. What Jinsu do when 20 years he can life.. make people become afraid.. Arrowhead clown very annoyed but he died haha.. hye jin mom die hmm.. police do nothing.. the detective see her daughter after seen jinsu death also hang story.. a priest become stupid at this drama.. at the end 1 of those rise from grave 😆,The premise was good and the effects of these so called monsters/demons were stunning. But then the plot just becomes far too over complicated and muddy and really let\\'s the series down. Could have been excellent but really let down by a complicated plot.,Hello guys I\\'m watched this full series all episodes and then I\\'m wrote the review this web series is full illogical nonsense do not acceptable. All things in this series is very badly present I\\'m unable understand what\\'s going on in every scene.,Boy, was this a miss for me. Even the concept was off. Three giant gorilla-looking monsters come and literally beat to death \\'sinners\\', incinerate their remains, then jump in the air or through a wall and just disappear. That\\'s it, episode after episode. You don\\'t even really know WHY these people are singled out for \\'hell\\'.Here we go with another recent Korean drama that\\'s bathed in violence (graphic, graphic violence) just for the sake of it. Korea puts out fabulous, well-written productions 9 times out of 10 so why this sudden penchant for over the top blood and gore Netflix programming eludes me.On top of it all, everything was badly done-the CGI monsters, the amateur acting, clunky dialogue, and repetitive storyline was so boring amid all that bashing and blood that I gave up after 3 episodes. I won\\'t watch violence just for the sake of it which is really what this series goal seems to be.,I don\\'t get the negativity for this show, I suspect the Squid Game effect is causing this as people are tuning in to expect more of the same.Hellbound probably shares the same DNA as the superb Midnight Mass without giving away too much spoilers.From the initial outset, as the show is from the director of Train to Busan, it might give the impression that it\\'s an action packed limited series. Once that\\'s over it\\'s replaced with a slow burn of a plot that\\'s never boring but I found to be highly engaging once I understood the subtext of it.I\\'ve watched many Korean drama\\'s prior to this, and this didn\\'t disappoint with it\\'s gory and often horrific scenes, and thought provoking plot that demands attention.,This series shows us how humans can be easily manipulated by religious leaders. What really got me excited for the next season is that shocking twist though. The plot thickens! You\\'d have to see it for yourself because I don\\'t want to spoil it.,After watching the best series of the year \"Squid game\", I gave this Korean show a chance since people were claiming that I would like this since I loved Squid game.NOT true. I regret that I spent so much time watching this show, even if it was just 6 episodes. It is so silly, irritating at times and boring at times.The \"monsters\" are so stupid looking that I don\\'t know who could think this is scary.There is no logic in the plot and the show is just a big waste of time. Do not bother to watch. There is so much out there to stream that is much more worth spending your time on.,I am on episode 4, and I am not sure I will finish. There is WAY too much violence. The computer guy with the glowing makeup is stupid and annoying. I have just watched where a newborn is prophesied to not only die in 3 days, but, will go to hell. A newborn. WTF?,At first I started it with eagerness , about the idea and to get to understand why it\\'s happening, but at the end there\\'s still something missing, after the episode 3 i started looking for answers but I ended up with nothing and the end confused me a little more.,I literally suffered through the hell this series was thinking it would amount to something- nope. Nothing. Slow, overdrawn dialog from very poorly acted and written scripts. Could\\'ve been a great premise if they actually focused on the \"hell\" aspect- but nope, just the same thing episode after episode. You will never find out what the demons are or what the angel is- i hung in there to find out- never found out. A big flat ZERO!,At no point does anyone in the entire series does anyone try and figure out what is going on. Everyone just accepts the events and the New Truth as if they have no minds of their own. In one episode, one character says half the world supports the New Truth. So 3.5 billion people don\\'t even question what\\'s going on? What about the other 3.5 billion? If you are hoping for a basic explanation of what\\'s going on, you are not going to get it this season. This season really is in 2 parts. The events that happen at the beginning and then what happens 4 years later.The effects are decent. The last episode of the season is perhaps the best episode which bumped up my rating from a 5 to a 6. The show is entertaining but the writing needs to be better. The events may be supernatural but human beings are naturally curious. We want to solve the mystery but no one on the show asks how is any of this possible. Plus, there are roving gangs of believers that just assault and kill people openly and the police do nothing. One annoying video blogger is all but calling for violence and yet the police don\\'t even investigate him. The roving gang even assaults the police and the cops don\\'t go after them. None of these are really spoilers of the main story but it just shows the problems with the show. The writers need to do a much better job in the second season.,It would have been better had the director handled character development better. Then again any character development entails reducing the pace of the narrative. Considering the number of reviews I read nowadays complaining of \"slow burn\", I guess makers traded off. It takes a chunk out of the series. There are virtually no characters you can root for, while the story provides no space for its actors to shine. So we are left with just one thing to keep us hooked: the premise. It is intriguing, no doubt. It is rich in its depth and vast in its scope. The first season ends with the series teetering on the edge. It could either go forth to claim greatness or retreat into the morass of also - rans.The Direction passable, while acting is competent. The production values are high, photography is good, and CGIs are good. The story moves forth in stops and starts. The script is riddled with plot-holes and takes far too many liberties with logic.But like I said, so much depends on here forth. A competent artist can take this and make something worthwhile, another .... well he would render it intolerable. After all even some of the best series had serious problems with their script but it was the man behind the scene who made us love them all.Watch it for the possibilities. Else wait for more episodes (if it gets a second season) to make your mind. It\\'s good enough but just barely.,Wow. At first I thought the show was trying to use monsters and religious gimmicks.to comment on the gullibility of humans.Amazingly, this show posed a series of questions that we don\\'t have answers for in real life.Is goodness still good if it was motivated by a fear of punishment/desire for rewards? Is the justice system providing justice or just judgement?The characters were rather flat, but it didn\\'t matter to me. The philosophical dilemma behind the storyline outshined everything. I highly recommend you to watch it but based on reviews I understand that it is not for everyone.,I\\'ll start with a question. Is it suidgame? No. Does that mean it is not as good? Also no. This is a different and unique genre of show. It almost plays out like an anime. The pace can be a little slow at times, but it is shrouded in mystery and I found myself watching all 6 episodes thanksgiving day. And can I just say; arrow head, to me is a completely realistic response to what would happen if such things as the \"angels\" were brought to the real world. Of course a crazy religious fanatic group would rise up and start targeting alleged sinners, would they live stream it to inspire fear but also to promote their group? Absolutely. Hell, (no pun intended) it happens now in the real world. We just don\\'t have the demons chasing after us in between. I like the acting, the special effects, the drama, and plot. I just wish some more questions could have been answered.,Like others have mentioned this just drags and drags. The idea was good, the effects were good, and the fight scenes were good too, but then you have the remaining 50 minutes of each episode and it just is soooo boring. I get that they are making a statement on society as is wont for Korean films to do, but at least make it interesting. I spent most of the time hitting the fast forward button.,I\\'m being generous with the five simply because in the first three episodes you sort of feel the plot fleshing out, characters being developed, story advancing in an excitingly dark manner. But, by episode four the series does a complete 180. It gets super boring, no character has any meaning at all, or impacts the story at all. Some characters are completely removed from the show without valid reasoning.You can tell the director used his same schtick from Train to Busan because no one does anything at all to protect themselves or to negatively impact the villain in anyway; simply just do the exact opposite of what a person with half a mind would do. In that case, it makes it hard to feel sympathy for these \"stupid supposed protagonists\".By episode four it turns into a religious nut job overly zealous overly righteous freak show and loses anything of value. Whatever of the story is left gets completely tossed aside as these freaks seemingly, and without resistance from anyone or anything existing, take control over everything, to the point their beliefs go exactly opposite of what the story is trying to portray.Nothing is explained, nothing is solved, nothing really happens at all that\\'s beneficial to the series. The CGI is atrocious, including the baby, and for the amount of time they show the baby, the producers should be ashamed.This isn\\'t a horror series, it\\'s a philosophical series about humans either succumbing to or defying god\\'s will. The director/writer must have had a mid life crisis coming up with this one, and the final twist at the end doesn\\'t help in the slightest, or make it interesting, since nothing was explained at all over six episodes.,I don\\'t understand the hatred and negative reviews this show is getting. I guess it\\'s not for everyone (in a good way). Give it a try, it\\'s definitely worth a while.,Whoa what a series.. Korean series will not disappoint you *#Hellbound* ending messeges though\\r\\ncan\\'t wait for Season 2\\r\\nWorth to watch many times. Go and watch it definitely ull like it.,Interesting watch. I liked the performances, premise and exploration of power. I also enjoyed the decision to not have a protagonist, it pulled the focus to the phenomenon rather than the characters.,Another excellent and original k-drama series. The only negative I have found is that it\\'s short! Hopefully there will be a second season as the ending of this season is the opening of a whole new era.!Of course the negative reviews are for those that came here to find another squid game...\\r\\nIf you liked Hellbound I recommend you \"Sweet Home\",I don\\'t understand the negative reviews on here at all. I thought this was gripping from start to finish, and raised some great questions about how it\\'s dangerous to follow without question. I really liked how it was split into 2 acts.I\\'m looking forward to see where they go with this in a season 2, because it has the potential to shape into something really exciting.,Well, I can\\'t seem to get those \"monsters\" out of my head. I am not a fan of fantasy, superpower stuff, or horror. However, as I got into it, I began to view them not as actual demons, but more as a metaphor for the unknown, for catastrophic events or metaphysical chaos (for lack of a better word), over which we have no control. Live one day, die the next. If you make it several episodes in, you\\'ll recognize the one where I drew this conclusion. I believe it\\'s humanity\\'s insufferable need to \"know\" that fuels religion, along with egotism, money and power. Stick with it and you\\'ll see what I mean. You have to watch beyond the first two episodes to get what\\'s going on. I would never let children watch, though. I am a grown adult, and it almost gave me nightmares.,This series is great, i watched all episodes on 2 days. It is also very well crafted and has a high-quality look. It is full of social criticism. Wanting something good can also turn out to be the opposite.,I binge watched this yesterday.Very good series. Seems to be two parts. 1-3 and 4-6. Kept me engaged.Very unique and engaging subject. Kept me intrigued as to where it could end up. Admittedly, come episode 4, by changing main characters, tended to lose the focus a touch.My ONLY issue was the child not being taken. There was absolutely no reason for this to not happen. Those demons would NOT leave the child, as their only task is to take it. The parents being tied together would not stop them.I loved the uniqueness of the story and the take on the righteous - moreso the fact that there was randomness to those selected - so the human perception of hell was incorrect all along.Cinematography, like most South Korean shows, was first class.Reading the \\'reviews\\' here - I need to state the following.1. CGI is bad. Then YOU go and create the CGI that YOU believe is acceptable.2. Story is bad. Then YOU become a screenwriter, get it funded, approved and make it workable in a series.3. Actors can\\'t act. Then YOU become an actor and see what sort of range you have.So many people here must be exceptional in their own lives to pick apart content so easier and readily. Go into the world, create something that is universally loved, not as easy as it sounds.,Started well but somewhere script derailed. As the name suggest nothing like hellbound. Same thing happening again and again.Missed opportunity from the director.,The concept of the supernatural punishing evildoers resulting in a massive cult and mass hysteria was amazing! The actual product... not so much. The creatures were corny and the story was a mess.,This is actually quite a surprising and good story. And, unlike Squid Game, it doesn\\'t rely solely on violence, but actually depicts a realistic painting of how the world reacts to a horrifying incident.In fact, the show is more about society and how humans react to something horrible, than about the violence itself.And for that alone the show deserves praise. Because it criticizes society and possibly even silently criticizes what is going on right now in the world.But there\\'s more.The show has good acting, characters boast a real development arch and the story has many surprising twists and turns that make you think. And, if that\\'s not enough for you yet, it is simply exciting and the CGI is great!After having watched Squid Game partially (and giving that piece of trash a 1 star rating) I was very very pleasantly surprised by how good \"Hellbound\" is, in fact.Sure, there are a few minor annoyances. The change in behavior of the female lawyer? Hm. Not very believable. But that\\'s about the only thing I have against it.Generall a very good show to watch, one of the best available on NEtflix currently.,No spoilers. Not what you\\'d expect. Worth watching. The show will make you think and is well done and we\\'ll acted. Watch with subtitles as the voice acting dub stinks. Most bad reviews here sound like people didn\\'t even watch the show.,This show is just awesome. All low ratings are here in imdb are fake. These ratings are by those people who thinks that this show is against Chrstinaty. But no this show is about spread fake propaganda using religion. Awesome show awesome details .,It starts off with cool yet compelling supernatural events.There is a cult leader, emotionally burdened police officer and it gets really good with twists.But then somehow everything goes awry and feels like a completely different show.Original cast and characters in the earlier episodes is great.Looking forward to season 2.,I watched the first episode for 10 minutes and thought the CG was poorly done and the premise was stupid. I stopped watching after that. A week later, a colleague told me that Hellbound is good and I should continue beyond the 10 minutes. I figured I can handle 6 episodes of this. And after the 6 eps, I thought this show is utter nonsense. Don\\'t waste your time with this show. Overrated, rushed narrative and a story that goes nowhere most of the time.,This series is definitely not what I was expecting when I saw the trailer. I was expecting a \"run for your lives\" kinda movies, but what I got was a damn weird family drama that doesn\\'t go anywhere. A LOT (and that is an understatement) of plot holes, and very stupid characters. If something like this happened in the real world, I would expect the governments, military and scientists were the forefront of defense. But NOOOOO, let\\'s turn our defense to the minor league religious cult. I know that some movies need to be watched from a certain perspective to make sense, but not this one. Not from a religion stand point, not from a scientific one, and not from a fantasy one either. So, what the heck is this crap ? I guess the title is befitting this series, as this one is hellbound. Do NOT waste you time on this one.,The CGI with the angels of death are very well done.The rest is just plain bad and stupid.The story is no good and there is 3/4 talking in every episode and the dialogues are not the best.The actors don\\'t pull it up anymore and only play mediocre.,In the end the first season of the series boils down to pretty much nothing. The whole plot feels like it was made up as it went on. Drawn out scenes add suspense but leave you hoping for more. Hardly anyone really tries to fight back and people\\'s response really makes no sense. You would think that when people know they can go to hell for their sins they wouldn\\'t start murdering in the name of God. I hoped for some explanation what the monsters are, maybe some mythology, but there was none of that.,Here we go....with the popularity of Squid Game we now have many new trendy viewers watching Korean media. These low reviews saying it\\'s \"boring\" after only watching 2 episodes is typical of the average viewer in 2021. If it doesn\\'t have grown men flying around in spandex, or some controversial woke topic at it\\'s heart people simply are not interested.,Interesting plot but I can\\'t describe how annoying, unnecessary and obnoxious is the colorful live streamer guy. I almost stopped watching the show because of this one character.,I had zero information about this story, never read the comic or webtoon, and i didn\\'t want to watch it at first (because of the bad reviews people gave) but I\\'m glad that i watched, it\\'s pretty good, a little slow at times, but shocking and great story. Don\\'t know why some people gave a low score, it\\'s not squid game.....,I dont understand what the hype is all about.The actors are good, their acting is superb.But the story...Why? What are they even trying to tell?Its like watching a movie trailer, but in episodes. Pieces of random scenes put together!The plot is unclear, i cant even call it a plot twist because theres no plot!!Its so unclear. Its full of surprise, a bad surprise , its keeps surprising me \"why they suddenly bring this up?is this necessary? How on earth this people suddenly stuck together?why?why?!!\"Its really is like watching a movie trailer!Watching this till the end makes me angry!,Enjoyed the series, Interesting concept ,I liked the pace and originality of the story. Couple twists in the plot. Looking forward to season 2.Still unanswered questions should be good when it comes out.,Don\\'t pay attention to those haters there. Is an excellent concept of religious cults and rise of authoritarianism in a fantasy fiction with a humanist view.Each episode gets better and better. After the second you\\'ll want to watch all episodes and the final is amazing.,Get past the slow 1st episode then it gets real\\r\\ngood right riveting watch special effects are very good not for the squeamish very violent as per Korean style.,That\\'s a definite 10 for me. I liked the idea so much, it\\'s really a howl new thing abd it was a big success 🔥🔥😍😍 kdrama are the best for me for the last few years, congrats for Korea end Netflix.,I decided to watch this because it\\'s the number 1 show on Netflix in my country and I saw articles it is the number 1 show globally right now and people are saying that it is as good as Squid Game. One thing\\'s for sure, it is not comparable to Squid Game. Nor is it any better than Kingdom.I completed all 6 episodes in one sitting. The first 3 episodes were good and I can say for episodes 4 to 6, you\\'ll only be watching it just for the sake of finishing the series. It gets a little slow, they could have cut some scenes out and probably the only motivation is to see whether the baby will eventually die or not. And that last scene in Episode 6 is a total WTF moment that will make you punch your hands because now you\\'ll have to wait for a whole year for season 2 to hopefully know why everything is happening.Giving it an 8/10 because it did keep me engaged and curious. And it gave me something to reflect on personally regarding religion and the concept of heaven and hell in some other religions. Some people say that this show is mocking Christianity but I don\\'t think so.Aside from that, I like how this show casted average looking people for most of the characters; even Yoo Ah In and Kim Hyun Joo looked like normal everyday people here, which is not typical of the usual Korean dramas where the main leads and supporting roles are super handsome or super beautiful or hot. The show is much more believable in this sense.CGI is acceptable, filmography is good and acting was decent. Just don\\'t watch this with high expectations or you\\'ll be disappointed. There\\'s many unanswered questions and hopefully they will address all of them in season 2.,The show has a progressive Rhythm , the first and the second episodes are little bit boring , but after that we gonna take a trip of mystery and thriller.The directing was good specially action scenes ,\\r\\nActing was good to , and i like how that any character can\\'t die there is no hero, and to many shocking moments . And the ending wasn\\'t expected.The show has a some mistakes,sgi and visual effect was bad, but still a good k show .,Leader 1 dies, the one that the whole world worships. Episode ends. Leader 2 is in place. Not a single second was dedicated how leader 2 ever got into place. Why!? I thought I missed an episode.And: Leader 2 and the TeenTok guy are amongst the most annoying and stupid characters ever in a show.,This was a good science fiction show. Had some great moral overtones, that contain cautionary notes about the intersections of group thinking and religion. I do not believe one religion was a target here, as the real crux was about the perversion of deeply held beliefs by the power-hungry. Indeed, a low-level antagonist even contrasts the show\\'s religious ideals to Christianity to differentiate the two.My biggest issue was the pacing. The plot conflicts in each episode felt way too repetitive in light of the fact that some of the series\\'s questions were left unanswered in the end. Nonetheless, because it is hard to find more original-than-not shows, and the suspense was present, I give it a 7/10. I did find the series entertaining, if not entirely binge worthy!,Perfect for people who have an extremely pessimistic view about humanity, replete with despicable, hateful and ugly characters. Maybe I\\'m watching the wrong shows, but this seems to be a hallmark of South Korean filmmaking. Appears to be a commentary about zealotry and the slide into fascism but the story is a sledgehammer with little finesse.,The CGI is a little goofy but once you accept the style of it the storytelling & world-building is very good quality. All the supporting actors, specifically the women, are incredible.I think this mostly worked because the creator of the webcomic was the main creator behind this project. It gives me Silent Hill vibes at times, and the cliffhanger for season 2 is really unique. Can\\'t wait for the next season!,Concept is OK unique but god, every episode is just watching random people getting beat up and burn alive. Makes 0 sense, the only reason I made it to the end is I was looking for an explanation of this but got 0, nothing makes sense. I\\'m not sure why people compare this show to squid game at all. It\\'s NOT even close! It\\'s boring, non sense, just gross and making you sick in the stomach for touring people and burning people alive.,Main elements of the series:Radical Group Arrowhead = QAnon-like with hardcore following influencing/controlling people through their messages and brutality. Dongwook, a true nutjob, is the social media personality of the group that preaches about the wrath of god, sins and living a righteous life in YouTube-like broadcasts while encouraging violence. The group go hand in hand with The New Truth.The New Truth = Religious organization, cultish and authoritative controlling people through using God, fear, sins, and a divine intervention. Gained power claiming the supernatural creatures are supposedly sending sinful people to hell and only they have the right on how \"this phenomenon should be interpreted\". Nobody knows, at this point, where these creatures come from or what they truly mean - (agree with one reviewer that probably they represent society\\'s judgements rather than god\\'s).Social Media/Media/instant uploads = It is quickly and drastically changing the mindsets and actions of people and not for the better. Facts/logical thinking are no longer given enough importance.The real horror of the show is not the hulk-like figures gruesomely sending sinful people to hell and the mysterious cult-like figure who started it all but the aftermath. That\\'s why the last three episodes are different from the first three. I saw complaints about that but actually that was a smart move by the director because its not about continuing with stories of all the characters from first episodes but about showing a drastic change (from episode 4 on) that most people are now controlled and living in a completely different world after only few years. I think the director wanted to show how fast lives can change through fear, misjudgments and blind following as there are many opportunists out there that take advantage to gain power.Lastly, If you are looking for another Squid Game type show, this is not it. Nor it is right and quite ludicrous to compare the two!! Also, if you are looking for constant action, blood, gore, CGIs that impress you and easy answers maybe this is not for you either because it\\'s all about the subject matter that is multilayered and philosophical. My only complaint about this series is that some of the acting needs improving in case of a second season so it doesn\\'t come off as pretentious & over the top. As for the undeserving low ratings, especially the many 1-2 star ratings, who knows what\\'s the thinking/motivation behind them (besides the Squid Game effect) but in this case really ignore them and draw your own conclusion.P. S. From the same director, highly recommend Train to Busan. A zombie horror movie with social commentary about classism & class warfare.,Im not gonna remember a lot about this show next week, but it was fun. The idea is brilliant, the execution quite poor. Those last seconds really shocked me tho; if there is a second season I really think it would be better, I hope what happens means something good and not some dramatig crap, it was really relieven when I saw that. The las episode is the best without a doubt, but it isn excellent neither. If that lady really resurrected then I hope is her and not something different like God incarnated or something like that, I want to see her with her children.,Outstanding series that focus on people style of life and it consequences that lead to doom. I\\'ve never thought that Korean culture has this kind of ideas.. Although the idea of the series is hard to believe when you compare it with different people religions. But this series make you afraid and think about your sins and where it\\'s going to lead you. I am really speechless....,The CGI is decent, the soundtrack works and the acting is good. It suffers from something I\\'m beginning to think is very common in Asian or Asian-inspired TV shows - filler. There\\'s a lot of it. Hellbound is an above average TV show that could\\'ve been a great 2.5 hour film. The fact it\\'s only 6 episodes rather than the more common 8 or 10 saves it somewhat.,Most of the low ratings for this series have the same comment on the \"slow pacing\" and \"lack of action\". I believe they were lured into series expecting a full-on action movie with lots of monster fighting sequences, and of course, they\\'d get disappointed.Instead, Hellbound is simply a think-piece on mob psychology and social morality. It\\'s about humans. Those demons are just decorative.Yoo Ah In delivers a strong performance as the cult leader Jung Ji Sung, but I wish he has more screen time.,A lesson in blind obedience and submission. Why aren\\'t anyone angry about the truly unjustful murders? Why aren\\'t anyone willing to pick up the fight, and try to make a difference? I was waiting the entire series for one such moment, but it never came. The best they could do was to deny DNT of being right.,I was too distressed until episode 5 especially with the newborn decree. To be honest I was confused where this was going but added a few more stars to the rating simply for saving the baby in the end. What a relief phew!I had tears when the innocent baby cried from within the burnt remains of its parents.,Firstly, people who have posted there reviews without watching the whole of first season please...just...Sit through the first episode and you will end up binge watching till the end. The first two episodes had there moments but they were necessary to set the universe and timeline in order for the people to understand whats about to happen.Overall the acting of all of the people was great and so many questions were left unanswered (in a good way) that i can\\'t actually wait for the next season.,This show is one big example of why audience reviews shouldn\\'t be taken seriously or they shouldn\\'t be allowed to leave reviews on sites like IMDB or RT because maximum people rating it low and complaining didn\\'t even finish the show they came from watching Squid game and expected every single Korean show to be similarly entertaining this show deals with human nature and superstitions that makes you think what you would do in that situation and it\\'s purposely slow paced because that\\'s the tone this show is going for not that it\\'s a flaw and the show succeeds in every aspect of it.Hellbound is emotional and mysterious it should receive as much hype as any other shows.,I hate myself for what I\\'m about to do, but it has to be done. I\\'m really, really failing to understand what it is people are failing to understand here. This is a blatant commentary on religious zealotry and why it isn\\'t a good thing. It should\\'ve also been patently obvious that it was about religious hypocrisy. And though it can\\'t be stated how annoying he is or how much I dislike him, I believe the painted freak that lives for condemning every one is basically the entire point of the show. I wish people would stick to what they actually like watching and stop leaving stupid reviews that aren\\'t fair.,Wots with all the hate I thought it was great can\\'t wait for a second season story was great acting was good funny in parts as well Netflix done will with this program.,Just replace it with Santa Claus and you know where this is going.Everybody in South Korea is depicted as a vacant, dogmatic imbecile.Santa Claus help us all!,Dark, moving and violently entertaining. Enjoyable and a little bit confusing at times but overall it has you hooked quickly enough for you to want to know more.,Tolerated three episodes of this sick, vile series then gave up. Hated every minute of it. The writers should be ashamed of themselves in creating this nasty product.,Meh.Before someone accuses me of being part of the \\'dumb\\' audience, lemme assure you I understood the metaphor of the show.The metaphor itself, however, is not enough on its own to make a compelling watch. The craftsmanship behind it is mediocre at best. The \\'hell-hounds\\' are borderline comical, the beatings are over the top and look like they were copy-pasted out of some teenage cartoon.While the meta is that the phenomenon is an un-explainable occurrence, I find it hard to believe that in-universe no one: not the government, not the military, not the police, not a single individual tried to figure out what was really happening and why? Why didn\\'t the rest of the world react? Why did no one try to fight back? Why are the good guys always so reluctant to kill even when their lives and those of their families are in danger?Overall, interesting premise, but executed worse than poorly.,Unfortunately this isn\\'t really a show about hell and demons, but rather a show about a cop and an insane cult leader who talk and talk and talk, but nothing happens except for about 1 minute per episode - they\\'re about 49 minutes too long. The worst part by far is some Tiktok reject in body paint who literally yells at you for minutes on end each episode. I can\\'t take any more of this garbage - my eyeballs can\\'t watch this trash, nor can my ears listen to anymore of it. Hard, hard pass.,Best one after a long time..new concept.. i could not had my eyes off. A must watch for fun, thrill and excitement knowing its fiction. I am Indian and beleive in Destiny and Karmas.,First two episodes were awesome and I was really invested.. Then at episode 3 it became too self indulging and not as authentic and that would continue till the end ... It really put me off I didn\\'t continue and stopped watching .. Bummer, I was hoping for the opposite.,After one episode, it\\'s getting too much boring story line and cover ups, also some unexpected plot where one part explain unexpected entry of actors and poor defination concept.,At first I wasn\\'t taken by this series at all. Between the terrible demon design and behaviour, as well as the early reaction to the fanatical church group I thought it was weak and lazy.But something kept niggling at me. So I decided to keep watching. By the end I changed my mind and decided I did really enjoy it.It\\'s not perfect, there are several things I would\\'ve done different (namely how the three demons work) but the human element of the story intrigued me enough to keep going and I enjoyed the build up and ending.,It may not be the worst but I find the script and the premise of the story pretty horrible. It does not happen often that you come across such a despicable plot. I guess they will find a way to make everything make sense in a second season. But I found this first season pretty gratuitous in its violence. I don\\'t think I will give any new season a try anyway.,6 episodes. 50 minutes each. A waste of time.Interesting concept but a nonsense development. They talk about \"the world\" and they just show a few cases in Seoul, so no scope.Bad characters and worse acting. Pointless show.,I liked the cinematography and style of shooting, and thought the actors did a good job with what they were given. But man did it drag.There is a hell of a lot of talking and not much happening in every episode, with quick bursts of interesting action. To echo other reviewers, I have to say I found the series incredibly boring for the most part and something of a chore to sit through. It was around episode 4 that I almost didn\\'t bother continuing, but forced myself to keep watching in the hopes of it improving.The last episode I found myself skipping forward just to get to the ending. The first 10mins and the last 10mins of this season are probably its strongest points. Everything else in the middle was downright boring.The CGI was alright, perfectly passable but aren\\'t going to win any awards put it that way. Except for the couples CGI baby, which looked incredibly weird in every scene it was in.,I missed the episode 7. This is why I rated low the last episode. Its feels like the story is just broken before climax.Recognized people acting like in the movie was really sad.The power of religion.,To watch this show, one has to suspend a lot of beliefs. To make the cult rise to power and human world as we know regress to the state of theocracy believable isn\\'t that easy. Unfortunately, the show doesn\\'t excute the concept well and most of time viewers have to accept the status quo as it is.There\\'s no other voice to counter the cult\\'s theory from the experts or the public. Police or military don\\'t seem to care to investigate the crime and supress the violent acts against the cult and Red arrow. The media, which is supposed to hold a great power to expose the truth, doesn\\'t do its job. And last but not the least, scientists don\\'t exist.This is like a half-baked project trying to get viewers discuss deep meaning of any of these scenarios, but with the reasons mentioned above, I can\\'t take this show seriously.,The story had real potential.The special effects were anything but special.The story had real potential, unfortunately the CGI ruined it. It would\\'ve been better if the demons were invisible, Anything would\\'ve been better than what they used.,The 1st 3min of episode 1 had me sold on the show. I was like DAMN the show looks crazy! I tried to get my gf to watch the show but she couldn\\'t because it was too bloody. Every time the demons showed up you knew things were about to get ugly.The actors did a good job. The story was okay. The slow parts are expected to build up characters, I can\\'t expect the whole show to be a rollercoaster and have good characters.The ONLY part I didn\\'t like... This is just a PERSONAL thing that gets my eyes rolling. The strong woman trope. This woman up to this point in the show as cool normal chick, but all of a sudden she turns into RAMBO. She beats up 20+ dudes with weapons at the same time with her bare hands, kneeing dudes in the head, 1 punching knocking dudes outs, flipping 200 pound dudes over her head. She falls off the 4th floor onto the ground below and gets up and just runs off like its nothing. She will have to walk down a hallway and 6 guys are in her way... no problem. She beats them all up and continues on her way to beat up more people and escape with dozens of more dudes behind her. This woman went from at the start of the show getting beat half to death by 5 guys while begging for her life on her knees, to RAMBO and James Bond put together. I\\'m cool with women kicking butt, but damn.,I love shows like this, and I am a Christian. Because... This has NOTHING to do with God or Christians. Just like Midnight Mass. It\\'s about people. People who want power and use a higher power to gain FEAR to gain power. This is an extreme over exaggeration of cults. Religion is just an easy door to show it through. And considering this is Korean doesn\\'t surprise me considering Asian culture try to prevent their people from Christianity. Cough cough China. This is a great way to gain control in showing \"those new truth freaks\" in a horrid light.But don\\'t you love seeing these reviews bashing Christians? Like... Somehow... This is real life. But.. what they don\\'t realize is they\\'re probably the same people screaming at some stranger for not getting the shot or wearing a mask...for the....greater good??? Hmm..... Thought provoking....,I guess.. \"they can go to hell\" if they don\\'t like it?Keep an open mind and watch it.Good acting, not what I thought it to be at the beginning but it still delivers quiet well the message about how dangerous religi0us fanatics and how easily they can believe in unfounded causes.,Apparently shows with a plot, that dont depend on explosions every 5 minutes and glib comments are boring? If you like shows that dive a little deeper and take time to build up the story then Hellbound is for you.,Some parts of this series were very well done, that need that we Humans have to find some meaning in the meaninglessness of the cruelty and death that unfortunately visits us all and how that need can expose us to the manipulation of the cynical is explored in a subtle and interesting way. As American and British TV offerings continue to descend into unwatchable woke nonsense I\\'m thankful that at least Asia is still producing good and interesting TV and Movies.,I still have no clue what I have watched. The show is a mess and doesn\\'t come with a Chinese dubbed track so the only choice for us is to enable Netflix Chinese subtitles which notoriously known as lenghty translation and often fading out in less than a second which make me hard to follow the plot.,Stop hate k-drama we are all same asian and this is another masterpiece from director as a korean he is really good critics about Koreans culture like you guys doing in online like a here\\'s arrowheads.,Not sure how this is somehow the new most watched show on Netflix, it\\'s ridiculously slow, the pay off is awful for the amount of time you spend watching it, honestly give this tripe a miss, Squid Game is so much better, it\\'s ridiculous.,It\\'s a very profound show. I don\\'t really know how to describe it, I loved it , for the message, for the screenplay, for the depth.+ it\\'s definitely more like a cinema masterpiece like Old Boy or all of the best cult coreans movies than a netflix show. Must watch if you like those movies, must watch if you miss great movies in general.Oh my, I just finished it, best thing I\\'ve seen in a long time. Corea is definitely the new eldorado for creativity. Keep this going please.,Anyone who would rate this series with less than 8 stars i\\'m sure that they haven\\'t understood the message of this series at all, it is a wonderful dark masterpiece.,The show starts with in promising way but then get very slow. I had to increase the speed 1.25 and then have to skip many scenes. After watching the whole show you will not understand where it ends and how it started. It is very confusing and doesn\\'t give any explanation....,The series is an analysis on religion, why it exists, the flaws, how different people cope with it. Often it harshly/clearly shines a light on reality of what actually is so obviously true when you think about it, which is interesting and deserves a high rating. Think widely misunderstood programme for thinking people.,Worth watching very good story and acting give it a try don\\'t trust ratings i find many great rated series absurd and boring go for it must watch thrilling series i did all eps in a day.,A finale that leaves more questions than answers. But yeah, it\\'s another good Korean show. Not as good as Squid Game, but it\\'s definitely entertaining! Some amazing fight scenes and CGI. Worth spend some time to check this out!,I was very excited to watch this series, as I read it took down the squid game on Netflix!! So I expected to watch an interesting idea!!The series was awful, and I decided to give it a try till the end, but unfortunately I wasted my day for nothing, it\\'s an idiot series and I do not recommend it at all.,It\\'s ok to watch it 1 time. But what I can\\'t stand I\\'d when a series give you more questions as answers. And if Netflix allow a second season is not sure.The storytelling is slow. The attack of the \"monsters\" is always the same.But it\\'s ok for one time watching. Don\\'t expect action or a fantasy overkill. It\\'s a drama with a small Fantasie setting.,Scenes were too slow, too much violence in every episode,Too much characters killed to prolong the season without any benefits, fed up from the dark scenes as it was so boring and slow , i feel like i wasted my time watching it, hope Netflix won\\'t renew for a second season.,Enjoyed the show immensely, found it well written. I would have given it a 10 but we never find out much about the reasons why people receive the decree, nor much about the \"demons\". Great, surprise ending for the baby and for Park Jungja, hoping season 2 will get the green light.,Take an interesting and complex plot line involving religion, occultism, paranormal occurrences and deaths, then make it as uninteresting and cartoonish as possible. That is what I have seen so far with this series. After 6 episodes that felt like a pain to get through as the story progressed, I will not be concerning my time with any sort of follow-up.Everything seems very forced and unnatural. Regarding the material I can see how that would possibly be the norm, but as things progressed o just felt like I was watching a bad cartoon.,I\\'m not one for jumping on hyped band wagons - I watched squid game and rate it a measly 5. Now this... this is entertainment.You need to go with the fantastical premise for the first 30 mins and let the story develop.I\\'m amazed by some reviews which score low but admit \\'switching off\\'. Eh?This show us philosophical issues and moral ones that vastly outweigh Squid Game and almost every other show.Stick with it to the finale and you\\'ll agree. Series 2 will be revealing. Resurrection anyone?,Outstanding movie\\r\\nsilently tell us our society truthonly humanity save us-religion is internal thing\\r\\n-we respect each other n solve each other prblms\\r\\n🌺 🌱\\r\\n🌴 🌺\\r\\n🌱 🌱\\r\\n🌷🌱\\r\\n🌱\\r\\n🍥🍥🍥🍥🍥\\r\\n🍥💞💕💞🍥\\r\\n🍥💞💖🍥\\r\\n🍥🍥🍥☁☁☁☁☁☁☁\\r\\n☀ 🐦 🐧\\r\\n🐤 🐦\\r\\n🐤\\r\\n🐧 🐦\\r\\n🐔 🐥\\r\\n🌻🌻🌹🌷🌷🌳🌳 🌺 🌱\\r\\n🌴 🌺\\r\\n🌱 🌱\\r\\n🌷🌱\\r\\n🌱\\r\\n🍥🍥🍥🍥🍥\\r\\n🍥💞💕💞🍥\\r\\n🍥💞💖🍥\\r\\n🍥🍥🍥,The idea behind it was great and that\\'s all. Didn\\'t even get through the fourth episode where the show gets a bit too stupid for my liking. A waste of my data is what it was.,I was expecting a lot for this series but underwhelming. What the hell is the ending?season 2? Ohhh and, it hurts me when youngjae hug his wife to save their child before the demonstration.,Another great Korean drama, well thought, well scripted of showing how humans are stupid, how can we be stripped out of basic sanity, how cruel we are. Leaves a lot of reckoning to do, but I am afraid, we are already in that state and there is no going back. Very sad.,Is this show perfect?NoBut damned It makes you think.It has mediocre acting and mediocre dialogues but the whole premise of the show Is so interesting.I guess all the negative reviews are due to the fact that this show has such a wasted potential.The writing could be a little bit better.There is one major plot hole which is very disturbing.This are not spoilers. It basic story.God is punishing people for their sins and the radical wing of the religion is beating and killing people.God is literally showing to the people that when you are sinner I kill you and you go to hell and people are still doing it.That\\'s just bad writing.But over all this show is a hidden gem.,All in all this show is pretty good another interesting tv show from Korea, the story and the pace is good, and interesting subject to work with. Suspens is here and you really feel for them when they go through judgement .. i\\'ll give this show a 7 but since many religious freaks put 1 i give it 9.Go see for yourself and make your oppinion, too many trolls who cannot comprehend SF ..,The show kept popping up on Netflix, and I decided to try it. It started slow, but it holds attention, especially since you have to read subs since I don\\'t speak Korean ;). As for the CGI, it is good, monsters look great, and I am happy that didn\\'t overdo it, always three, no more, no less. The first surprise I got is at the begging of the fourth episode, actors changed, the pace changed, it felt like almost the beginning of the next season. After a while, you see what\\'s going on, and it is worth it. This is the message for all of those who didn\\'t go past the third episode, there is a cherry on top at the end of the last, sixth, episode, and it\\'s a big cherry :D. Koreans are giving us better and better shows, I can\\'t wait for what will I find next.,After reading the mix of reviews I thought \"give it a go\".So glad I did.The story runs a lot deeper than at first glance.I thoroughly enjoyed every episode and cannot fathom the reviews that describe it as boring.Lots of on screen gore and an interesting theme run through this really good show.Give it a go and see for yourself.Korea can in all fairness make bloody good tv.,It\\'s funny usually on IMDB if a show or movie has great reviews I hate it. This show is absolutely nuts and I dig it! I felt terrible for the single mom that got smoked and it shows how twisted human nature is. Don\\'t listen to the negative Nancy reviews and give this a shot.,The creatures are a a metaphors for things humans can\\'t control like a natural disaster.It\\'s really a story is about how humans react to this phenomenon and eventually create hell on Earth.It makes you ask, who gets to decide what is right or wrong, who has the authority to interpret these events and how we should address them ethically as a society? With religion, politics, or an individual\\'s deranged thoughts?The moral here is to be sceptical of organisations that have a monopoly over interpreting information (ie. News organisations, certain religious groups, etc) that uses fear to manipulate us. Something that\\'s quite relevant to society right now with the disinformation panic.,Some interesting ideas, but tone, style and narrative arcs all over the place. Most disturbingly, it continues the recent Squid Game trend of glorifying violence under the guise of repudiating it.,I can tell this drama is same level with fan favorite Squid Game. I can believe Korean Drama are stepping to next level too quickly. This drama is not focused on supernatural powers and events. This drama spotlights the human nature changes when they face something they can\\'t imagine. I am sure you will have fun from this drama.,I started just thinking of watching one episode and perhaps leave the rest for a later time. Instead, I ended up binge watching the whole series. The story line, suspenses and gore are gripping and will leave you numb at times. Nevertheless, it\\'s a brilliant series and can\\'t wait for S2.,I\\'m sure those who gave it one or 2 star they didn\\'t watch it through and only watch it for a\\r\\nfew seconds, it\\'s an amazing art that simply explains how religion and religious manipulate our entire life.,This series sticks to it\\'s genre and definitely not for all. If you\\'re into Thriller+cult stuff with fantasy creatures then this might be just your thing. The pace could be slow for some but I get why that\\'s required especially in this kinda Korean series. The background score was spot on.The story was great too. Definitely a short series on Netflix that I really liked. This show was dark, voilent and emotional at times. Not sure why people say it\\'s not realistic but I think it\\'s definitely realistic since I\\'ve myself seen people making terrible/dumb decisions for the their love of religion!I really thought that the script was well implemented except that the CGI could have been alot better!Again we cannot compare Koreans to Hollywood yet although I\\'ve seen better Korean shows/movies with better CGI.However, the acting was on point! Yoo Ah in - this man can do all kinda roles!Unsure what people were expecting but this to me was definitely a great watch and worth recommending to people. There are alot of answered questions. However, it looks like there could be a season two so that explains the cliffhanger.For those of you who liked this show can watch strangers from hell/hell is other people.,The protagonists made way too many dumb decisions, which got me frustrated with the show many times throughout and made them unlikeable, antagonists were not likeable as well.There just was huge lack of likeable characters for most of the show, and the show left me with so many questions, but so little answers.Fortunately, character likeability picked up near the end so I\\'ll watch the next season, but if nothing gets answered, and characters don\\'t smarten up during season 2, I will likely stop watching.To be fair to my unhelpful review, I can and have suspended my disbelief to enjoy shows a lot, just look at my ratings, plenty of English or Korean shows I rated well with characters others would consider too dumb instead.Also, I notice with shows, Korean ones especially, imdb has too many haters that rate 1, or stans that rate 10 to offset the haters and to hopefully bring more Korean media around the world, but please it is better to be honest with you\\'re ratings, a lot of imdb review pages seem too artificial because of these false ratings, you are not helping.,Hellbound has a really solid start and a good concept. The opening scene is captivating, suspenseful and exciting. However, I feel like the whole execution could have been better.The 3 creatures that come to punish people really don\\'t look scary and are actually really funny looking. So it\\'s hard to take the scenes where they appear seriously. They probably tried to stay faithful to their original design but they should have thought of designing them differently given the CGI results.Also, it became a little too much when they showed that the creatures could bring back someone to life and beat them up if they ended their life before their execution date. I literally rolled my eyes.One thing that makes it hard for the show to really give you an immersive experience is that people really don\\'t seem that amazed by this strange phenomenon. I mean sure, we see people screaming and running but after that, it seems like no big deal? The world would literally be going mad in real life.Also it doesn\\'t make much sense for a group of people to be going around beating people up if they truly believe that they should live a super righteous life in order to be closer to God and be spared from those creatures.All in all, it\\'s entertaining and I would still recommend to watch. But there are definitely a lot of point to work on or that could have been better.,I was waiting untill last if there is any things secret behind all thise cgi things monsters where coming but no there was nothing and those whole 6 episodes was just a waste of time and nothing else maybe this would be my one of the worst series of kdrama I\\'ve ever watched.....,I watch it, as I watch every movie or show, in the original language. Just more fun that way, though having to read subtitles all the time can get annoying. Nonetheless I watched through the first 6 episodes in just one day.Tbh, after episode 3 I thought it was over. The story concept to me seemed like one of those \"What if?\" storylines that stop after telling a short story and leave the viewer wandering what the hell (ha) just happened. Having watched through the end of the season now, I\\'m happy it didn\\'t end there. I would not agree that it is boring or lengthy, that seems to me like quite the opposite of it, just sometimes the story-telling takes the form of Korean drama, I don\\'t mind that at all, but I do realize how that can seem boring to some viewers.I have no idea how well the translations to English (or my native language, German) are. Sometimes the subtitles are not quite correct (to translate a grunting noise with \"Yes, sir\" seems a little far-fetched to me), but it was always clear what\\'s meant.So I give it a 10, because it\\'s enjoyable, original, and quite capable in making the viewer - me - question his own values and how he would react in such a situation. Might not be everyone\\'s tea though. Thanks for reading.,I liked watching this. It was dubbed but that didnt seem to to detract. It was pretty violent when the hell creatures turned up. But what really detracted was the God awful acting of some of the characters. The arrowhead guy on the radio / podcast and the one who played the Chairman in the last 4 episodes. I know they were trying to be manic but it was too much. They need lessons from Nick Cage on how to do manic. Squid game had similar issue with over acting by some actors.,... because I dont want to make the actors cry. But this shameful peace of anti-cinema just goes nowhere and takes you like there is somewhere great youre going.Jigs up. Hard fail.,Interesting concepts explored in this series, but scenes were quite repetitive. Plot is interesting, but not fully developed. Same for the characters -- they do not seem well developed. This series has the potential to be much better. Hopefully, the cliffhanger at the end signals that there will be a second season. To be honest, the cliffhanger was probably the most exciting/climactic/interesting segment of the show, so I would rather the producers use this as the climax for the series.,I hesitated to watch the show due to low ratings on IMBD. I decided to watch it anyway and I absolutely love the show. Currently on Ep5 and can\\'t wait to see what happens next.Very intriguing storyline, great music, great characters. Excellent portrayal of human psyche and how people react when scared. Reminds me of life in the USSR and people ratting each other to the government. Very scary to see how human behaviour never changes.,I was looking forward to this one for a while and the special effects were great along with the idea for the series.... However the plot was almost non existent and made very little sense. Characters actions and events made little to no sense and in the end you have a series with a great concept and great special effects that fails to deliver anything compelling for the viewer that will keep them interested in watching!Give this one a miss!,This is a really good drama, the cast did a great job .. if you are into fictional themes yet realistic stories and plot this is a really good one that shows the darkness of humans.,SoumikBanerjee25 review is just spot on. When is hollywood going to learn that remake stuff is not the way to go; when is hollywood going to learn not to pander to some indiidual or ideologies. Second korean show that went to top on netflix, and I am sorry people don\\'t know about crashlanding on your or my mister among others that really good. All of them may deal with social issues BUT never really fist you in the face over and over and over.,I\\'ll just quote Queen Gorgo from 300;\\r\\nThis will not be over quickly. You will not enjoy this.Still, gave it a 4 since something made me watch this snorefest.,This show is great. I really don\\'t understand the negative comments 😕. Haters they must be, that\\'s the only logical explanation here 😂. Can\\'t wait for this crystal generation time to be over with. I hape the new generation won\\'t have balls made of glass.,Well we went into this with high hopes given the early media hype of huge viewing audiences but quickly realised this was pretty terrible. A very silly plot, terrible acting, awful dialog, and the monsters looked silly. Don\\'t bother.,The show made me think if the world that they had setup was an utopia or a dystopia. And that made me nervous. It made me keep wondering if I would want to live in that place or not.I don\\'t like the overdramatization that many Korean shows that I have watched tend to make. The actors are always hyperbolic with their dialogues. It\\'s probably just how Korean shows and movies are I guess.The music seemed haunting and the action scenes were high quality. Camera work seemed excellent as well. No issues with the CGI too.It\\'s a small show with only 6 or so episodes. But it was a thrilling ride end to end. The script seemed tight.I would definitely watch out for the next season.,I thoroughly enjoyed this. For me there aren\\'t that many series I have to watch, but this one I had to watch. Very compelling and original. Sometimes a bit violent, but I loved it!,I was hooked with the opening scene where they maul the guy at the cafe, but it just got really slow after that. There was a lot of unnecessary dialogue and scenes that it didn\\'t need. I watched the first three episodes and none of that needed to be almost 3 hours.If you have a short attention span, don\\'t bother, you\\'ll doze off at the acting.3/10 because the mauling was cool.,Not your ordinary drama, this is more like What if in real life, when divine reveals itself.So how do we define good or bad (actions)? It is simply a human expression or notion right? Have you ever thought about the insects you accidentally killed while walking at the pavement or just killing the annoying mosquitos from sucking your blood, causing you annoying itchy bump? Would these insect think they deserve to die, just because you\\'re passing-by or because you do not want to get itchy bumps? So are we the good or bad to these insects?Sorry for the long winded introduction but that is what i get from this drama, when the 3 monsters showed up and killed each with a definite time, we human assumed it is an act of god or devil? It is us human who loves justifying what is good or bad.Regardless if it\\'s good or bad, one thing for sure is human being will always seize opportunity to gain, let it be monetary or fame, that\\'s human!If you lived in this Hellbound world, what or where do you seek for peace?,Story is good, VFX and action scenes are also good but the worst thing I feel in this series is that it is very very fast and you can\\'t get time to connect characters of series.,The first 2 episodes blew my mind .The CGI,the acting, the setup everything was so on point. I couldn\\'t bring myself to even skip the intro and outro in between , it was that good . The pace slowed down after that since episode 3. The initial thrill to guess what might be the reason to whatever\\'s happening was high , but it died midway . The show failed to deliver the message it was trying to, it was very vague overall . Not worth the hype.,If you don\\'t sin, Jesus died in vain. Seriously, who cares about these religious films? What is the point in them? Authors, what do you do this for? I\\'m unable to understand.,First 3 chapters are gud and has some momentum, but it loses from 4th chapter onwards and drags a bit on 5th & 6th..certain things, need to closely see to understand the story flow, else can\\'t understand if you miss out a scene.,SLOW AND BORING. Unbelievably underwhelming. I was really excited but not what I was expecting. I was expecting more action and more rapid paced plot. Basically a slow final destination. I usually love Korean made shows and movies but this one was disappointing. Unfortunately not for me. Give it try though, maybe you\\'ll enjoy it more than I did.,I didn\\'t write any reviews before and the only reason I wrote here is due to the number of racists comments.This show is wonderfully written, great sequence of events with amazing acting and plot twist at the end of season 1WHAT DO YOU WANT MORE????,The film should have made a little more sense. It is impossible for a newborn and still pure to go to hell. What a fool...!!!!Even though when he grows up the baby will commit a great crime, it is impossible for humans to know when he is born, only the devil knows. Too glorify the devil and the devil in this film.,I made it through to the third episode and then gave up.The idea behind it is good but poorly executed, riddled with plot holes and tedious to watch due to poor acting.Don\\'t waste your time on this.,It was fresh and fun because the drama characters believed in it as a concept of religion and the process of society falling into chaos seemed to be expressed urgently and frighteningly in the notification and demonstration of hell that was mysterious and unknown.,I think it was a drama that shows how people accept and believe in unknown phenomena and fears, and how pseudo-religiousism occurs. The actors\\' acting and stories were really impressive and good. Well made drama.,Pacing is too slow (Even if i have already hit the fast forward). I tried to watch it but it is too agonizing, its like your being punished to watch this series. Cinematography is uninteresting. Mediocre acting. Boring dialogues. My eyes hurt when i see this neon character.,Korean web series best most expensive and after squid game is 1st number of web series watching\\r\\nPak ceractor is best actor and you Jun best Korean director most expensive web series.,Dumb People who are upset about not knowing detail about supernatural creatures,that\\'s what we suppose to know now with characters. I\\'m really looking forward to see season 2.,True, it has some interesting themes and concepts, but there\\'s one downside to this that makes its themes pointless. It\\'s boring, poorly written, and has zero interesting characters.Now, I firmly believe a show can succeed if it is fun and either well-written or contains interesting characters. \"Hellbound\" has none of those. It\\'s so painfully boring, that I only managed to make it halfway through episode two. It is poorly written, nothing that the people do in this series makes sense and are unrealistic. All of the characters are bland, with no defining trait or interesting characteristic; something that honestly shocks me, considering that the man who made this is the same man who made \"Train to Busan\".Honestly, the only reason I rated this 2/10 is that it has an interesting concept that not many shows or movies delve into. Unfortunately, that doesn\\'t matter if you can\\'t pay attention nor care for anything that happens in \"Hellbound\".,I watched this over a few weekends. I was lost as to what was going on until the final 2 episodes. If you stopped after a couple of episode you will not the final understanding of what is really happing to these people being \"demonstrated\". Even at the end of the series you still wonder what\\'s really happening. I like the series because it is really making me think about religion, doctrine and how it is used and how it can be used to control people.,Have to say after reading some of lukewarm reviews I was going to give this a miss. So glad I didn\\'t. I just think too many people want all action and have no patience for complex story lines and plot development. Yes the plot leaves allot to be answered and you get a feeling series 1 is just setting out the premise but I was hooked from episode 1 to the end. The story and plot take time to build out the characters and so much so I watched all 6 episodes back to back. Can\\'t wait for series 2.,Wow... Wat a roller coaster season it was.... mixed feelings of emotion,belief and superstition....start a bit slow but then... it was a roller coaster ride. Everyone was crazy about the trailer with first scene.. But the last scene was beyond this world, wat an ending, I literary crying in the end. Eagerly waiting for 2nd season..... I don\\'t know why people is giving low rating in imdb, I think they don\\'t understand the real reason behind all this. Sad to see low rating... Go for it guys.,Not sure why with the bad reviews here but it seems mostly on watched the first 2 eps. The story picked up starting from the 3rd eps. To me it is worth watching.,Reveling the time and date of death by unexplained phenomena is a great idea that could build a lot for the story and the drama. But this series took it to the most boring, shallow way.The rise of religious waves based on that phenomena without a proper explanation, in addition to unprofessional actors gave the worst impression and watching experience was so boring.The dramatic change in the community behaviour according to these religious waves was unbelievable.,I\\'m not Korean and I\\'ve been watching American TV shows for more than 10 years and this is the first south Korean TV series I\\'ve watched recently. I don\\'t know why it\\'s rating is 6.7 in IMDb, Because I believe it deserves far more! Acting is really good, Music is beyond fantastic and really fits the position in which it\\'s being played. They did a really good job on special effects. It tells us a really unique and exciting story that draws your attention from the beginning to the end! Maybe those who\\'ve watched the show should give it a second chance!,By far this show is ok for me until this webcam guy shows up. Besides his weird neon makeup, His charactor is so annoying as hell. All he does is shouting about his conspiracy thought which i can\\'t believe there is someone stupid enough to believe that bullsh** As we can see many followers attacking people like they didnt scare that this will led them to be beaten up by the three black mud gorillas that will ask them to pay for thier sins too.,Idk how ppl rate this less then 5\\r\\nInteresting, intense had me on the edge.I think people that rate this show low are the people that only watch Hollywood production\\'s.I watch alot of movies and shows , never seen this concept. Worth a watch in my book .,I think I am masochist cause I have watched all the six episodes and it was boring, really boring. In the end no explanation and all the characters were really dumb and very predictive in their stupidity.,Superb after watching all 6 episodes.and after you watching all episodes please watch all episodes without skipping and then you like this series 👍.........................\\r\\n...................,**Vague summary spoilers- nothing to ruin the story**I gave it a 10 to try to help with the low score, but honestly, Hellbound is a solid 8. It\\'s not perfect, but so few show are.I don\\'t understand the people saying it\\'s slow or boring. The first 3 episodes they establish a world learning about a terrifying supernatural phenomenon. It focuses on the religious interpretations people are creating from this and the cultism surrounding that.Then the last 3 episodes are taking place when everything that was set up in the beginning is \\'accepted\\' and common place.The story doesn\\'t move slow at all, and it does well to set up the main premise. It\\'s purposefully uncomfortable and drawn out in parts but that helps with the tension and frustration (in a good way). Plus there are several twists that really push the story. Also, some pretty great fight scenes in eps 4-6.The only thing I think people could have a problem with is the brutal and emotional violence scattered throughout every episode. It\\'s quite intense and it might not be comfortable for everyone, so defiantly for a mature audience only.,What could have been a powerful critical painting of fascism, sectarism, human violence, greed and stupidity, with this powerful description of a society becoming the passively terrified slave to a mix of Taliban-Moonish (we\\'re in Korea, not Afghanistan) cult born from horrific (and never expained) monster manifestations and giving birth to a pervert Christian schism peppered with all the bells and whistles of modern consumerism, TV, media, social network, videos and nerdy hooliganish followers, this clever (and philosophically provocative) master script is (sadly) absolutely ruined in the last five minutes by a cheesy Disneyian redemptive happy ending (there\\'s even some snow to add a touch of Xmassy nativity): the infant meant to die burnt alive in public and then bear proof of the naked absurditiy of the notion of sin and more generally of all divine \"law\" is finally spared (in total contradiction with the previously almost existentialist original tone) to become de facto a sort of new Messiah... Cherry on the cake, an ultimate twist (obvious teaser for a second season) reveals the ressuscitation of one of the first victims of those ceremonial pyres. Sort of heavy cliffhanger a la Supernatural...,A movie name called Aparichitudu telugu movie or Anyan tamil movie , Hindu book of Hell called Garuda Purina, hero has multisplit issue, man one of those 3 slpits is deadly, called as AParatichitudu or anyan. Kills sinners as per the book of hell.,Seriously question sanity of people who enjoy this its 6 hours of innocent people getting savagely beaten by wanna be christian zealots and cult members where you are left questioning the behavior of the everyone. Like how do you storm a police station and not get shot? Or knowing you condemn the world to hysteria by not recording the cult leaders sin death because your daughter committed murder? When you know she probably gotten off due to brain washing. No real resistance to the cult. And seriously no spokes man for saying that freaky face is a demon? Just stupid brutality for sick people too enjoy hell green lantern had better story structure and graphics. Point is if you have time to waste and like watching car crashes, slaughter and train wrecks. This is for you.,I very much enjoy many Korean dramas and films; I have been watching them for well over a decade (also many Japanese and some Taiwanese selections, and started with now older HK films). Netflix somehow manages to select the worst (this is not their first poor choice) -- no doubt catering cynically to a faction of the US audience who have little cultural taste, no apparent appreciation for good character dramas or depth and variety in human-oriented stories, and who love hyperviolence (such as in recent video games and lots of US films that feature endless tedious action, violence, sometimes sex, and little compelling or meaningful plot). I won\\'t waste too much time here. Made it through three episodes of this series (won\\'t bother with the rest), and though I like the main actors/actresses (and have seen them in other shows), this show is one of the worst and most undeserving of praise that I have seen amid many, many good to excellent shows (series and films) from Korea. I can like simple entertainment such as Train to Busan, but not this nightmare. Sad choice, Netflix. You really could do much better, and you could use your choices to advertise numerous demonstrations of storytelling excellence that have driven Korean TV, cable, and film entertainment to its current heights of praise. This is not a watchable example (it is in fact nauseating on many levels and may even be insulting as a representation of typical K-Dramas); it ought to be trashed; and this is (again) why I do not subscribe to your service. I can find and have found many far better Asian shows (by all measures) on my own, and will continue to do so.,After watching first episode, thought its going to be incredible. But, with more episodes it becomes very slow and boring. I really had to increase frame speed to 1.5 times to complete the final episode. It\\'s no where close to Squid games.,I\\'m suprised by the amount of negativity in the reviews of people giving it up after 2 episodes.Yes it\\'s slow at start, but it just gets better and better with each episode and starts to really all nit together from episode 3+. The characters and actors are fantastic, the human nature and the whole story explanation of why things are happening is great and somewhat thought provoking, gets you a bit out of your comfort zone thinking how you might act/feel.I rather have sth like this instead of the common trend of great 1-3 episodes with meh dragging out stories with no point.So yea I\\'m not gonna say much to what\\'s actully happening, because it\\'s easy to spoiler since it all ties together, but it\\'s one of the few series I genuinely really enjoyed in the last months.,Vfx are good...story is completely on point....and i am totally waiting for season 2Idk what people here are typing that acting\\r\\nwas bad..clearly the don\\'t know what acting is...actors did a fantastic job especially the arrowhead stream guy...the energy with which he captivated retention it was brilliant...way more better than any other actor who played some psychotic teen streamerInfact i\\'d say its even better than squid game when it comes to story , visuals ,lines and directionsYES,i said it.,The start is slow but the story build up & suspense are too good. Just ignore the negative review & watch the full season with patience. Season 02 will be juicy if the team crack it right.,Awful acting, terrible script, too many flaws, stupid story which leaves you with nothing at the end! I don\\'t understand how people gave a higher rating than 2 ? For what ? Intro music ? Such a boring and was painful to go thru with it hoping it would give me something at the end....... Nothing!,Hella good. Loved the actors. Good storyline. Good show to binge watch. I am super excited to see more of these actors. I am sll for this. Super great.,When I saw the CG monsters in the trailer, I thought, \"Director Yeon has come up with something strange again\" and I didn\\'t have much expectations for this show. Fortunately, the focus of this show was not on the supernatural phenomenon itself, but on the human reaction to it, and the overwhelming insight and originality of the work offsets other technical shortcomings.While \"Squid Game\" by Hwang Dong-hyuk or \"Train to Busan\"(2016) by Yeon himself were entertainers for many people, this show seems to be a work for the audience who put more weight on the subject matter of the work. In terms of originality, it can be compared to \"The Wailing\"(2016) by Na Hong-jin, and the ending of the last eposode is reminiscent of \"Children of Men\"(2006) by Alfonso Cuarón.As a Korean director, Yeon Sang-ho is not yet at the level of masters like Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho. But he has proven within the mainstream that he is an original storyteller that will continue to be noticed.,First episode was so-so, but after is just a nonsense. If we were living during Spanish Inquisition it will have some meaning, but in XXI century to produce such a pseudo-religious garbage doesn\\'t speak good for Netflix.,This series is very very slow. This makes it difficult to watch. I felt like I was screaming at the TV most of the time, as no one seemed to have a backbone in the series. The acting was a bit touch and go with some characters. The ending was frustrating as now we clearly need to wait forever to get any answers.,This show is extremely slow in moving the plot. From Episode 2 to 5 it\\'s the same thing over and over again. Episode 6 is good just because of the cliffhanger.Bad acting by side cast. The only good actor was Kim Hyun-joo who plays a character of a lawyer. I watched this show just because of her believable acting throughout the show.This show would\\'ve been better if it was a 4 episode series.Personally i would suggest that if you\\'ve time watch it or wait to see if it gets renewed for season 2 because if it doesn\\'t it\\'s a pure time passer/waster.,This is no where near squid game ( which is awesome and more realistic).Maybe the idea was good, but when it came into making, it has lost all the gist...I didn\\'t feel like continuing after 3rd episode.,A series starts with a lot of question that was difficult to bind later I was so wonder how ? By reach third episodes I was ensure the will be bad , I was right (unfortunately) Just plot twist for second season, another thing was focused on but then they just skip it !!! One of them was when police manager said \"it is not organic \" for honest I expect more .,Some dumb people watched this with English dubbing and posted poor reviews. Always watch foreign language movies or series in original language with subtitles of your native language. English dubbing of Hellbound is pathetic, voices and dialogues (way different from intended) sucks. Just watch it it is slow at start but picks up well in the end. Deep messages given as usual by Korean cinema.,Although it has been touted as \"dystopian\", I believe Hellbound is a amplified depiction of modern day Korean life, as seen from the perspective of the writer (and probably many of its citizens). The younger generations call Korea \"Hell Joseon\" because of the deep caste system which prevents many from advancing or achieving, where some of the wealthy look down harshly on the middle-class and poor, where things much of the world sees as nothing, many Koreans have been raised to see as \"flaws\"- from where you live, where you went to school, to what your parents do, to not having living parents... anything that can be used to put one down is used. Art imitates life, and the writer expounded on it.In this series, I believe the \"New Truth\" represents certain media outlets and corporations who distort truth, cover up, spread unverified rumors, and manipulate public opinion to their advantage. Godly living is clearly not their mission, so I\\'m not sure why so many people didn\\'t get that.The \"Arrowheads\" represent Korea\\'s toxic cancel culture. For years, individuals who live to bring down others have taken to the internet on seek and destroy missions as soon as some \"scandal\" breaks out. They often cite they are \"upholding the country\\'s conservative values\" as their excuse- while mercilessly harassing and bullying and threatening others into submission, even encouraging suicides. (The irony being that these behaviors are not valuable or conservative) The message here: Lies spread like a disease, words have the power to kill.The monsters are NOT sent by God; they represent peoples\\' unjustified judging of others; hence the fact that no one knew how the hellbound had \"sinned\" or how a nicu newborn was \"judged\" as a sinner. When the original leader killed the man who had murdered the girls mother, it served to confirm that the \"hellbound\" were just people who had been judged indiscriminately, something that happens daily in our world.The lawyer, Song So Hyun, represents the average citizen, taking on and fighting back against these evils. In Korean culture and others, a man who is sent to prison can also see his wife, children, and family persecuted for his crime. She not only seeks to expose the cult, but to protect families from that condemnation.I believe it speaks to several social, political, and religious ills that plague this country and the world at large. I think it makes a powerful statement, and one that most will only really understand if they understand where the writer was writing from. It could be possible that some reject, put down, and ridicule this piece because they see their own behaviors in one of these entities. This work is too thought provoking to be subjected to unjustified judgement.I however, am looking forward to the next installment.,First of all, I would say to ignore the people who have given this show low ratings because this was never made for them. They probably watched it assuming it was one type of show, and it turned out to be a different show, and they are bitter about it. I don\\'t like drama period pieces, but you don\\'t see me going on the Bridgerton\\'s page and giving it low ratings just because the show wasn\\'t for me.I would highly recommend watching this show if you like animes like Death Note. It is quite different from Death Note, but does have the same flavor in the whole supernatural judgement against sinners thing. Overall, the show was fast paced and intriguing enough for me to be hooked. They had nice cliff hangers at the end of the episodes which made you want to watch the next episode right away. I do think the first 3 episodes were better than the last 3 episodes because the pacing was faster in the first 3 episodes. The CGI for the monsters wasn\\'t the greatest. It was good enough, and frankly wasn\\'t the main focus of the show. The monster scenes were merely catalysts for the rest of the show\\'s plot. That being said, I do believe they will dive deeper into the supernatural phenomenon and the monsters\\' origins if they come out with a 2nd season.The show wasn\\'t perfect. I thought the characters did stupid things sometimes that made no sense. There was a vigilante group that would go around kidnapping and beating people up in name of God, made of mostly young kids. The fact they could do that with the police almost never catching them was quite ludicrous, especially since these were low level thugs, not smart enough to hide or escape effectively. And it was just plain stupid that the good guys who were opposing the bad guys did the bare minimum to protect themselves or fight back. I mean these vigilantes were beating people with bats and pipes; maybe get some weapons of your own to fight back? Or gather with a group of like-minded people who may have been victims of the vigilantes before and band together to fight back? Just felt the good guys were portrayed as lame ducks and let the bad guys just wail on them, barely fighting back.If you like drama stories with supernatural elements, then watch this show. If you are looking for a straight horror show, then this is not that show. I love horror shows, but this is not a straight horror show. The supernatural element is only there to push the drama along.,Get ready to give that fast-forward button a workout unless you\\'re a fan of boring dialogues and a stupid story. The only reason to watch this is maybe some innate curiosity as to what the three monsters are all about and where they come from, but you should just do yourself a favor and google the answer instead of sitting through this \"watching paint dry-simulator\".,Concept Kafi uniqe H 1st season se pata chalta h ki andhvishwas Kese kam karta h or log kese isse paisa or khoff paida karte h\\r\\nLike Islamic Terrorism\\r\\nBut jo iski high light chij h Ye sab naraz jane wali chij q or kisne khene p kam karti h kese suru hui iska jawab season 2 m cahiye.,I watched all 6 episodes something would apart from those beings killing humans on some prophecy. There is absolutely no story line in the series apart from random killings. It made no sense.,I was exited to watch this show but now I am regretting about my decision. The show is completely boring and the plot is very confusing. I mean why the three demonic creatures or whatever those were from hell killed those people and sent them to hell. I mean only God has the power to do it. But it was unclear as innocent people were also punished. And also in the end one of the people( Park Jeong-ja) was sent back to the world as her body was regenerating. So mystery is totally unsolved. I got the message that the new truth was misleading people about it and it maybe similar to some of the religious group and other groups in the real world but again the origin of those creatures is unrevealed so it\\'s so confusing. Maybe they\\'ll solve the mystery in the next season but overall it was disappointing to watch season one. I was way to boring. I watched the total six episodes very patiently thinking when it\\'ll end.So am very disappointed.,Perhaps its my age (mid 50s) I don\\'t know but recently movies and series coming ot of South Korea are becoming exceptional. I likes Squid games even though I didn\\'t think I would. The plot even though a bit thin at first grew in my opinion. Like most movies these days has political and religious undercurrents and morals. Cut under the thin ice of all that tatt.it is quite enjoyable. It still leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I want to know where the hell pardon the pun these things come from. So I hope they make a second series.,Hellbound is a new type of dark fantasy. Director Yeon Sang-ho of \"Train to Busan Final Express\" has succeeded in drawing the ultimate human drama by mixing religious themes and violence in a well-balanced manner.It\\'s an abstract story that doesn\\'t solve the mystery, so it\\'s a drama where you can clearly see what you like and dislike, but the idea is novel. The tempo is good and there are unexpected events, so I never get bored from episodes 1 to 6.This time it was Season 1, but I\\'m looking forward to the sequel to be made on Webtoon in 2022 and Season 2 will be released in a few years.,To the people who are giving it lower then a 4. You aernt a movie critic. Stop acting like one. Good show overall and I liked the mystery\\'s that were being uncovered each episode. Really left us with something to ponder in the final episode though so that\\'s why I\\'ll be coming back to season 2.,This show can\\'t simply live out to the topic at hand, but must important of all, their characters are incredibly forgettable as well, as the creatures seen as angels.Poor designs overall, some good convos, too fast-paced and boring sometimes, unnecesary long beatings and action, many undeveloped situations.There are a few good thoughtful payoffs, but as a show is kinda bad, works better on book, if there\\'s one.,Ep 1, good start, intense, big plot, lots to explore\\r\\nEp 2 eh?Ep 3, what?Ep 4 ridiculous\\r\\nEP.5 quit ? Or maybe some miracle to savage this drama\\r\\nEp 6 nothing but garbage, 6 hours totally wasted\\r\\nnot only wasted, so regret watching it.,Very boring and worst series ever. It showcases wrong and negative about God but in reality it\\'s exactly the opposite. Believing in the name of Jesus closes the doors to hell. It\\'s that simple. Salvation is free, repentance done in the name of Jesus opens doors to heaven. God never want to throw people to hell. It\\'s for Satan and this series portray exactly the opposite of what God wants. Stop making such series!,The webseries is basically all about existence of god or not the episodes show some unusual things which people commit as message of god. We can\\'t deny to the fact that even at today\\'s world this question is extremely arguably so, a movie creating a impact to the people negatively or positively on god should not be recommended to the people maintaining health lifestyle.,Don\\'t waste your time, I\\'m a big fan of KDrama but this series isn\\'t even close to good. I recommend you to watch Save Me to save your time.I heard it will be a second season!!!! Netflix are crazy but they know a lot of teenagers and some of the crazy KDrama fans will watch it no matter how the plot and the graphics are bad.,A partially slightly bit stereotypical content, and from time to time rigid characters. In principle it makes you ask outright contemporary questions beyond kdrama, cultures, and time. The authors give you some answers, and a preview for new questions.,Netflix should cut of relationship with this director who keeps making terrible show. Its absolutely terrible direction, poor editing. Show like this will ruin korean production reputation so I hope netflix korea just cut relationship with this director.,Starts slow and builds fast up to the end, a series haven\\'t made me feel this anxious in awhile. Humanity is scary and brutal as are the monsters.Had to write something for countering the low reviews. Deffinetly not under 5 star show.If you want a show that explodes in a big bang first of episode one, this is not for you.,I am not sure why so many people are upset at this show for not fully exploring where these creatures come from or why they\\'re here. The ending is clearly a cliffhanger for another season. We don\\'t know YET. That doesn\\'t mean we never will - be patient!I thought this series was great - I binged it, so that says something. I, like others, also like that it shows how religion or any belief system can be radicalized so that it is dangerous. You would think we\\'re out of the Middle Ages, but so many of us still hold superstitions and mythical thinking. Angels and devils? Really? You think? Or maybe some very primitive humans tried to find meaning to something they couldn\\'t at the time?Remember Arthur C. Clarke\\'s own words? \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\",This isn\\'t worth your time in my opinion! It\\'s absurdly confusing, laggy, and the plot is like Swiss cheese: full of holes. The first couple episodes intrigued me and then it totally runs out of gas and sputters out of control. I don\\'t even care that it\\'s violent and gory, I\\'m not a wimp but I just want a competent storyline that makes sense and something that grips me and this show has none of that. The one redeeming quality is that the acting is mostly good, but that can\\'t save the flailing plot.,WHAT I LIKED:\\r\\nPretty much everything. Despite the fantastical nature of events depicted in the show, one can easily draw a parallel between those events and reality. Pretty much every authoritarian system out there, which includes religion and the current environment of shoving everything down your throat for \"your safety\" because \"they\" know better, is succinctly and brutally demonstrated in the show. To me, the show is about death and the randomness of it, and how certain despicable opportunists have taken advantage of that phenomenon and contorted it to suit their mythical narrative and amass untold influence and wealth.However, the best part of the show was the end. It\\'s the most beautiful thing I\\'ve seen in a show/movie in a very very long time. That one thing balances out the nihilism and overall bleakness of human nature the show is spilling over with.It\\'s just six episodes long, as opposed to the meandering and repetitive 16 episodes that most Korean shows tend to be. I suppose we have Netflix to thank for it, as they impose that condition, and have managed to get some really good shows produced, e.g., Squid Game, D. P., and the entertaining My Name.There\\'s no point talking about the making of the show and other technical accomplishments. And those don\\'t matter to me much. If a show can pull me in into its world. Regardless of the nature of that world, and keep me invested in the characters and the events, then that show has done pretty much everything right. So was the case with this one as well.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:\\r\\nThe show suggests there will be another season. In and of itself, the show is complete. It reaches its conclusion, and there are plenty of answers one can extract from it. The last-minute \"twist\" was unwarranted and made me go, \"Oh, come on. Not you, too\", a reaction identical to the one I had after watching another amazing show, \"Squid Game\". To me, the \"twist\" just overcomplicates the narrative, which clearly wasn\\'t required. I guess the financials took precedence over art here, yet again. Or, maybe, the story was conceived this way from the beginning. Regardless, I don\\'t like it. Too many shows and their impacts have been ruined because of this stupidity.Another complaint, although this is just me nitpicking, is that one of the main characters in the first half of the show is abruptly dropped, never to be seen again in the latter part. He was a prominent character, and no reference was made of him in the second half. That just stuck out like a sore thumb for me.BOTTOMLINE:\\r\\nAfter a bit of world-building, the show gets going, and is relentless in its bleakness and just the overall human a$$holery. As mentioned, the beautiful end is the only moment you get some respite from all the doom and gloom. If you can digest all of this, then the show should be an unforgettable experience for me, just as it was for me.,This series got terrible reviews then somehow there was a rash of 9s and 10s. How strange!The first 6 minutes and 30 seconds was good. Then all downhill! The acting is terrible. The script is worse. I usually only write reviews for exceptionally great movies or series. The bad ones I don\\'t want to waste any more time even thinking about it. But this was so extremely bad, I had to warn people: Stay Away!,The tree monsters look ridiculous and unbelievable, despite that, the show turns out to be very interesting in the way it explores the human reaction and plot twist along the way. It\\'s a good show with a slow start (episode 2 was very boring), but after that, you could become invested in the story. Looking forward for season 2 and the web comic it\\'s based on.,I would love to have given it 6 or 7 stars but the fact that there was literally no ending really sucks. They are obviously setting up for a season two but these shows have got to learn how to close out one season before moving onto the next one. I feel like I just wasted six hours of my life.,Its beginning is unrealistic. But all the things come after are very real. All the religious frenzies reflect the dark side of South Korea. On religious issues, director Yeon may be none to next (at least in South Korea).,Such and enticing and very in the now show to watch, please don\\'t let others reviews spoil your open mind.2 episodes in and I\\'m really into it! You should be excited about the story as well as I am!(I actually applauded on the couch at the end of the second episode, with cheering and all),I was expecting a horror fantasy kinda series from such a director. But this is utterly waste show ever created by korean with no sense or logic or story itself.Don\\'t waste your time on this.,I\\'ve thought a few days about this show and come to the conclusion that apart from some relatively good 3D animation and after effects it is just pointless. The story does simply not unfold to the viewer, there are not even clues to why humanity is facing such unjustified raw violence. To all that point towards the next season and argument with a standard (or major) cliffhanger I just can\\'t agree. As the show does not even give a single explanation or at least a hint to why all of this is happening it just feels like a random sequence of mediocre dialogues and raw violence. Maybe I\\'ll give a second season another try but the first season was a waste of time.,The people giving one star reviews to this seem to lack any kind of perspective beyond a binary system. I thought it was absolutely amazing, and it is unquestionably original. But I can understand if others found it a bit slow or dark for their liking and gave it a 5 star rating or similar. A one star rating on something that isn\\'t a complete and utter screw-up of a production is just people trying to leverage the ratings down for their own agendas and should be ignored. Give it a go.,Not sure what Netflix is thinking pushing these new Korean shows. Between this and squid games over-hype with pretty CGI, horrible character development, and lackluster resolution maybe they should go back to renting out DVD\\'s.,I didnt have high hopes for this show, I actually stopped for a couple weeks after the first episode. The first scene was great, then it goes into the slow part, finding out what is what and why it\\'s happening.But as I stated it again, it was just nonstop craziness. It\\'s you\\'d get emotionally attached to a character, something will happen. I\\'ve shed some tears, it\\'s actually a bit of a frightening concept of the show. Religious or not. I haven\\'t even finished it completely yet, but, as much as I\\'ve seen, it a greatly written show and the actors were amazing. They acted their parts better than expected.I loved the different rolls you\\'ll follow. It is a more complex story line so I can see why people Do get lost, but it didn\\'t hinder the show, it made it more addicting for me. Just because soe people Couldn\\'t follow it, doesnt make this show boring or bad, they just have small brains.,Anything with subtitles has to be exceptional. I understand that we get the benefit of watching movies, series, from around the world but it had to be great to keep someone interested long enough to want to read to be able to follow a show.,Pros\\r\\ni personally think the acting is good. Premise is unique it could lead to a very interesting series\\r\\nthis 1st season focus more on human\\'s selfishness, the 1st chairman of the real truth, after receiving his decree, wants everyone to live in fear as he does.Yet its human\\'s greed and selfishneed to exploit the situation and use religion to gain power.It shows the viewers blind faith could lead to being deceived.Which was tbh a good touch.Cons\\r\\nhowever, none of the supernatural phenomenon was explained up to the end of season1. At the end of it, the only revelation was that obvious throughout the series. Who will be sent to hell wasn\\'t based on sins. Thanks captain obvious. If it was sins, all those violent arrowheads would be long gone by then. What are these angels? Sending a newborn to hell? Really?In the end i was left perplexed and with more questions than answers, leaving me quite dissatisfied.,I have no idea how I managed to finish this one, it took me 2 weeks to do so. This is great show to watch before sleep if you have insomnia. You\\'ll sleep like a baby in matter of minutes. At least I haven\\'t managed to go through one episode without falling asleep twice.It just makes no sense and it\\'s absurdely boring. Where are those giants coming from? Why are they killing people? Major plotholes all around and so many unanswered questions.As major korean production fan, this was a huge dissapointment for me.,I am so sick cause medium have the good review on this drama! It\\'s fake! They got the money to cheat the audience. Every pieces of this drama is extremely terrible, too waste of my time for watching it!,I usually never make a review, but i choose to make my wasted time on this mini-series to have a purpose. So here we go..and i try to make it short as possible.Hellbound introduce itselfs with a young guy, suddenly being attacked, molested and killed by some hulk-alike monsters/demons from hell, in open daylight and in front of audiences. Then after this ritual, which this boys soul is being pulled down to the underground/underworld, the monsters quickly disappears again as they showed up.A shockwave is now started and everyone starts asking; \"who are they and where are they from etc.\", and now they got your attention and you start asking for coffee and telling your girlfriend \"Hey baby, come and check this out\".Hopefully she doesn\\'t care, but if she unfortunately comes and sits by you, then she will fall asleep very quickly...and that saturday night is gone forever m8, so keep that in mind :-)Cuz Hellound is very tricky, it catches your attention, but offers nothing valuable in return. Its all about dialog between uninteresting people, who dies, which you don\\'t care about. The story itself is moving nowhere. Some (dull)demons are molesting, obviously only sinners, before they go to hell. Thats it. The story make you believe there is something interesting going on. Bu there isn\\'t.All this mainplot entrance is just an excuse to put you into a sideplot story about cultists who are against each other. You start getting bored because everyone and everything is getting more and more careless. You want to get back to the mainplot and want more explanation. Instead your being pulled into part 4 by force and manipulation and just when the company realizes your about to shut down on everything, they come up with a \"BANG\" shock-effect...and there you go, now they got your attention again. Oh boy. Now you have to watch another 3 parts until the grand-finale...that must be something, you think.But instead you get the finger again, sorry to say dude. You have to wait to season 2.Thats what Hellbound is all about. Something you will not return to, not after this insultment.Its dull, boring, a global evolution that matters all religions but moves only around a handfull of these same people, like they where the only men or women around. This is how stupid it is. No media, coverage, no politics, no science. No answers. And the road to the finale can ONLY disappoint even further. You would never recognize the actors on the streets if you saw them afterwards, trust me.So avoid it, and save your time for your girlfriend...before she becomes your ex by seeing this s... :-)),Don\\'t even know what they want to talk about. But also dont want to know what is happening. The only interesting episode was first episode. 3 bully monsters came down to punch a person. Lol. What do they even need 3? One would\\'ve been enough. And their plot twist is cringe.As a korean review, 1 star is only for 3d designers.,Poor plot lines, tedious, boring, main character changes all of sudden, it only has 6 episodes but you will feel bored from episode 3. In short, do not watch or you will regret.,It\\'s a sad indictment on society. It stimulates violence and aggression. To top it all off, It\\'s too stupid for words. It cannot be categorized as horror or even crime. It is prejudice against humanity and all religions.,I finished this tv shows season, and for me its ok, not amazing and strong pshycological story telling, first 3 episode was good, and 4/5/6 episode was mediocre, not telling about this creators, not showing hell, and just people\\'s phanatism side shows and dat\\'s all...,I really wanted to give this a go, but in the middle of episode 3 I could not watch any more. There are stuff that are so bland and things happening just for the sake of chaos with no realistic motive or reason.At least try to paint the show and the random humans there in a way in may happen. Not just because of chaos. It seems like the answer for so many actions was: \"Ahhh yes, chaos\".,So, how to start i really don\\'t know cos i really loved this web series, this web series is really sooo good i swear to god. The character of min, bae and his wife including others was so awesome i really had goosebumps in my whole body while watching. K-dramas is lovesss mayn. The cgi, concept of this series was so nice too as we had witnessed everything. Its like all in one pack. Till the end we never got to know who the real villains was. This web series has pure content and everyone\\'s gonna love this for sure. Also, I\\'m happy for the part where a baby became the super hero to the world as he saved other ppl for committing further sins so that they won\\'t get the decree. O God! I must mention this too when the bae and his wife protected the baby and saved him risking their life mom and dad are the real superheroes and i love the character of bae. In future i will be like him for my family too. Now, I\\'m waiting for the hellbound season 2 where the baby will grow big and strong with the training and help of her new guardian Min. O wait the ppl who got burned by the hell monsters got their lives back too. So, bae and his wife can take care of the baby now. Oh mayn! Finally I\\'m totally happy.Lastly, I\\'m concluding by saying please hellbound productions release the season 2 asap.,I like the concept Of this Overall Drama.I don\\'t know who gives them these Ideas to the S.koreans.They are just awesome at making new stuff.But it still needs Improvement.I am Giving Full stars for the Idea.,When I first watch the trailer, I thought the plot will be like the monsters were some kind of robots controlled by the cult in order to gain attraction from the world. But when I start watching this, the director doesn\\'t even try to let us know where does them came from, but It doesn\\'t even matters anymore. What matters is, is how scary this series is. It is scary not because of how scary those monster or execution scenes, but how realistic it is.For the first 3 episodes, the only thing that carved inside my mind is how realistic it describes about the modern world: How internet can make a crazy and dangerous idea spread out like a virus, nibbling our mind with horror. But no one realized how absurd is this and no one tried to stop it at all, instead, they use this theory giving mental pressures to the ones that doesn\\'t believe this. Soon, media and internet became a dystopian world that doesn\\'t allow any one to speak out their ideas.In the end of the series, it seems like we have a \"happy ending\" to show the wake of the freedom mind in people. But how many \"happy endings\" for those people with autonomy mind will happen in the world?Somebody, just want to watch the world burns.But most of the people, just want to believe to the fire that burns down the world and prohibited any one to save it.,At first I was hesitant to watch it because of the negative comments about the series. But I still tried to watch and I didn\\'t regret it.New and Strange concept, if you\\'ll compare it to other series Netflix produces. When you the 6 episodes, You will have a questions that are not answered and you will really want to know what\\'s next and have a part 2.CG is not that good but you will be taken to the acting of the artists. Special mention to the actress who acted as a lawyer. I must say this is one of the best female actress \" in korea \" doing action genre in a korean series.( I loved watching foreign movie/series and this is one of a hundred that a female Korean actress can portray an action scene well),I felt everything as it was real, it gave me the chills every time ,I have read some of the reviews and people says it was boring I don\\'t think that\\'s true , because with every episode something else it\\'s revealed. The final episode made me want more ... because it\\'s becoming more and more interesting ... at specialty the ending. Yeah it\\'s pretty hard to watch it because of the sever violence ... but the extrem violence that people do in this series is very realistic ... in a true way... if this was true (not S. F.), this violence would be exactly the same in real life. The extreme violence meaby will make a lot of people to stop watching the whole 6 episodes.But as I said, the ending will make u want to see another 6 episodes.,It\\'s just boring and too much violence. I strongly prefer Netflix should not encourage this kind of shows. It should encourage one can sit with his family and enjoy the show. The story line poorly written and contains strong violence.,Waste of time, it only shows how stupid the people are in the show.So people are just watching and being panic when there\\'re monsters killing people?Nobody is trying to figure out where those monsters come from and why they do it?Government is not even trying to protect the people from the monsters?Why the citizens are so stupid that could get brainwashed so easily? Seriously?And the Korean gangstas don\\'t even use a gun?And wtf is the last scene?This show is just ridiculous and stupid, a waste of time even there are some good actors, most of the parts are just not making sense!,Madly waiting for next season. I had expected more better end and i think this lackness will be fulfilled by next season.😅👿😈 Really good storyline and character and of course mother father love is beyond all.,Disappointing waste of time......\\r\\nI couldn\\'t wait for this nonsense to end.Pathetic point and very bad image and impression for the younger audience.I can\\'t understand how this can be even mantioned as \"worth seeing\" tv series....,Ugly, dumb & poorly written plot. I\\'ve strong doubts that the writer & the entire team members doesn\\'t even know what they want to tell!!! Such a watse of my eyesight🙄,Don\\'t wait for a horror movie of a blood-filled kind, it\\'s actually a psychological film.Tells us about unconditional imitation and without people\\'s thoughts\\r\\nThe power of the media and the power of lies and fear are far more terrifying than those three giants and hell.I loved the end of the story so much, what it shows us, never to judge too soon.,So this isn\\'t a show you are going to like if you think this is an action show. The first EP makes you feel like that but it isn\\'t.This is somewhat of what I would call a philosophical/drama show with 5 minutes of action.So don\\'t watch it with the mindset that this one is seat gripping, you will be bored some times but overall it is good. Also the story makes you think what is the future of the story because the situation is plainly helpless.,A must watch series. Acting is up to the mark...this season has lots of cliffhanger. I\\'m eagerly waiting for the next season !! Episode 4, 5, and 6 better than 2nd and third.,This show is a must watch! Action, the suspense, and the storyline is great. There is plot twists and I loved it. Not a single episode disappointed. Korean shows are on the rise!,It will be watched because of netflix korean series are new trend of the world.. It is using deep wawe of the Squid Game, nothing more.. I wont recommend it .Dont make your self sufferer. Use your time on better things.cya.Aga izleme agah.,The concept is really fresh, the plot always keeps you on edge as it\\'s very unpredictable what\\'s going to happen next, and the VFX is like never seen before.,I don\\'t give a shiiiit what people say, for me this is great. CGI is good, story line is good. I just complain how short it is because is just 6 episode, so i hope Season 2 will be have more episode.,I personally ask people to watch K-dramas because it is justified & entertaining. But after watching this I will never suggest anyone to watch it rather I will tell them not to waste their time and disturb mental peace by watching this.,Here I am at 5am hooked on this show. I don\\'t want to turn it off!!! The storyline, gore, everything is exactly what I needed. Very entertaining. Imagine knowing when your gonna die. And how. Just wow. Lol.,Really great in every way\\r\\nIn terms of story, filming and ...\\r\\nEspecially the last part which was great.I hope that the next seasons will be made and aired soon.,Not sure why there are so many bad reviews but I found the show really interesting. I\\'d been waiting for this since the trailer dropped and I was not dissapointed at all!There might be some plot holes but nothing that takes away from the show. The acting and storytelling and leading up to the scenes is all fantastic.,Just finished watching Hellbound, and wow, loved it, brutal and original, interesting deployment of the narrative like the split in 2x3 episodes, the twist at the end, great paranormal thriller ambiance, worth trying if you were hesitating!,This show will only like by immature audience (mentally).It is very unrealistic and disturbing!There is so much non scene things in this series and very hurtful to watch, there is so much violence that will effect your brain.Production is good but concept is stupid.,Such a boring show.The story is meaningless and complete waste of time.I started to watch Korean series recently but this one is changing the concept.,South Korean streaming television series directed by Yeon Sang-ho, based on his own webtoon of the same title. The first work in the Jiok was an 11 minutes short animation directed by Yeon Sang-ho in 2002.,I\\'ve never seen a genre before. It was very fresh.I watched it with excitement, and although part 3 may be boring, part 4 is very fun.The squid game was more fun than the hellbound, but I think it\\'ll be a hit.,Stopped watching after they included \"VIP\\'s\" like they did in squid games.They stole from midnight mass, used koreans as a trend and ripped from squid games.This is entertainment in 2021. Humans vs humans, nihilistic violence and greed.,So serials... looking forward to season 2.Why did the child survive?Does hell really exist in the worldview?What is the conclusion of Saejinri Church?There are still too many questions leftLooking forward to the next episode.The action scenes are a bit lacking.I think Yoo Ah-in will also come out in season 2If you\\'re a religious person, it\\'s fun enough.However, this drama is not recommended for non-religious people.,I didn\\'t expect it, but I think it\\'s a work with a sense of immersion and depth than I thought. It is a different genre from squid game. I don\\'t think I\\'ll enjoy this work just for killing time, but I think it\\'s a new genre and has revealed a new quality of work.,Especially in the last episode, I felt thrilled.I wonder how the ordinary public will accept it,but people who know how to think will raise their thumbs.,I coudn\\'t understand when talking streamer.And why this drama has dark mood?I don\\'t like this dramaplease make good drama like Squid game.I coudn\\'t understand when talking streamer.And why this drama has dark mood?I don\\'t like this dramaplease make good drama like Squid game.,This movie is a karma, even a helpless baby couldn\\'t escape it. Very dark, gore, violent, cult with black mirror style. Really question about humanity. Can\\'t wait for season 2. 10/10.,I am seeing many comments and reviews making some kind of comparison to \\'Train to Busan\\'. This is a very different story telling.There are some people making connection to other films such as final destinations and midnight mass (which is bonkers given this series is based on a webtoon series which began in 2019). This is based on a misunderstanding of the premise of this film.A lot of people are finding trouble how to interpret this series and are frustrated with character arcs that seem to end nowhere.Well that\\'s the point. All the characters are completely mediocre, selfish, boring, and don\\'t really have amazing character growth that people are used to in a character propelled story. This is not that and if you want to watch something like that, steer clear of this one.If you want the characters to discover the source of the angels and rules behind the burning/sending to hell? Don\\'t bother watching the series because you will not get satisfaction.This is about how do mundane public react to extraprdinary circumstances that cannot be explained by anything we\\'ve normally used to explain things. People are at a loss. Nobody knows what in the hell is going on. And there seems to be absolutely no way to fix the situation and the whole world knows about it (Not like final destinations where it\\'s a journey of few individuals to attempt to escape their fate while everybody else lives not knowing a thing about it). How will the world react? What choices will be made and how do those choices change when more information is revealed which contradicts the earlier choices. It\\'s about us. What will you do?We don\\'t know what\\'s behind the angels/god. And we likely will never know but it\\'s not something we can easily ignore as people are being burned alive by monsters on a daily basis. What do we do? What would you do? The final scene in the taxi, that\\'s the message the author throws at your face in case you didn\\'t bother to give it a thought.,Whoever watched the whole episodes and was able to catch the messages would rate it high.People who just want to chill and watch TV without digesting deep messages would rate it low.It was a great movie as I liked the sarcasm on human beliefs and those twists, but I was sad that there are some places that could make many people turn off the show.,Having been an avid fan of Korean dramas for a while now, I can safely say this is a great little series. Reading the other reviews, there\\'s a notable theme going on, and it seems that most of the people rating it very low are also the people that stopped watching after 2 or 3 episodes. I mean, if you\\'re going to rate a show, at least watch the full thing.Very much enjoyed this show, because of course the trailer sucked me straight into wanting to watch it. It\\'s Korean, it has supernatural elements, it\\'s dark, it\\'s gritty and yes it\\'s brutal. I went into it thinking I knew what to expect, where it was going to go and assumed it was going to be action packed with monsters running around tearing people to shreds. It very much delivers A LOT more than that, so expect a bit more of a slow burner bit with good character story development.However, when it\\'s time and the hellbound monsters do show up, the scenes deliver the anticipation, fear and bloody gore you\\'ve been waiting for.I\\'m not really sure why some people have rated it so low, either you haven\\'t invested in the full 6 epsiodes, or you just assumed it was going to be lots of bloody monster killings like Sweet Home. I\\'d say, give it a watch regardless of the reviews your read, because if you invest into the story AND actually watch it to the very end, you\\'ll probably understand a lot more of what story they are trying to tell....plus the last episode is awesome!,If you do not want to watch confusing and mysterious shows, don\\'t watch it. This is for people who likes slow phase and well written stories. Gotta read the webtoon just to get a glimpse on what will happen on season 2.,The story is fantastic, if someone says they saw the plot coming or that is similar to something else, they are lying. True, it was made to have a second season, but this is not a series to watch and forget, specially in the world we are currently living, for anyone thinking a bit about how humans are reacting and polarizing now a days, how crazy cults, politics and beliefs are \"the thing\" today, this drama is absolutely a masterpiece, no laughs, no lightness, is just a mirror to the absolute disgusting behavior of humans. I question all those who hated it and said is was boring which side they will be if the events of the series happened in real life? It\\'s perfect to start a conversation and see with someone else, to question our beliefs and what makes us good or bad... and how we justify our actions. Simply beautiful.,I thought this is gonna be fun and thrilling but the stupid show ever. Please don\\'t waste your valuable time on this stupid show. Some People have vote 10/10 I can\\'t believe them. Ewww... i am about to vomit after seen this show.,I love series plot awesome storytelling unbeatable i like so much all the camera angles and screenshot fabulous acting to the all actors very beautiful Hindi dubbing.,With Season 1 only being 6 Episodes - there was alot to cram in and alot to share with us the viewers. All I can say is, I enjoyed EVERY Episode and hope that there is a Season 2! Absolutely Loved ALL the characters. Well worth binge watching! It gets 2 Thumps Up from me!!,What\\'s the point about this movie? Uncleared ending. So wasting my valuable time. Very bad story line not make sense 👎🏻\\r\\nI prefer watch other korean movie. This one is very sucks.,This series is on a different path from the squid game, which led the story with rich narrative and attractions every time.The Hellbound is slow but persistent and profound.In the reality of hell, we fight the hell of human beings.,This is one of the best Neflix series I ever seen.This movie is reflecting our society.I believe we are living it the hell.Hell is not far from us.God save us.Oh, We save us, not god.That\\'s all.,I will keep this short and simple.All these bad reviews come from people that did no finish more than half the show, are not used to this pace (Came thinking it would be a fast pace action movie because of the trailer) or, maybe, are very religious.The show gets better and better as it goes on till it reaches an insane climax making you beg for another season.With that in mind, make the decision to watch it fully or skip it.,I watched all six episodes over the weekend.After watching it all, I was still left with lingering feelings. It\\'s rare for season 2 to be successful but it makes me look forward season 2.,First off all, anybody rating this at 4 or less has a small mind and no intelligence, fact. It\\'s an original idea which makes you question life after death, the concept of sin and the balance between good and evil. Some people complain it\\'s slow and depressing which is stupid as it\\'s a horror show so it\\'s not likely to have sunshine, lollipops and tap dancing featuring in it. Its not slow, it\\'s bringing out the narrative. If you want fast, watch a film, not a 6 part TV series. As a true fan of horror my entire life, it\\'s great to see an original Horror Concept amid the same old formulas of most new horror films. Looking forward to season 2.,It\\'s a move that all religious will hate. The movie has everything any religious hates. So I don\\'t like this movie although I was shocked about the idea and the flow. Do not expect high ratings, the movie shows they work harder than we think.,At first I thought the story will be interesting, but damn...I am dissapointed. Is just a sad movie with some exaggerate parts. Life for real...at some point I was really pissed off. I\\'m just sorry for anyone who will waste time on this.,To start off, Hellbound is nothing like Squid Game. And that\\'s a good thing because it\\'s \\'insanely\\' brilliant in its own way. I just finished watching it, and needless to say, I am completely shaken up. Overwhelmingly riveting, had me questioning my entire life and the world by the end of Ep 2. I literally *cannot* wait for S2, and pretty sure this show is going to be a huge huge hit on Netflix.The way this show delivers its message about society, and the mentality of people, is fantastic. Look deeply, and you\\'ll find the scariest parts are actually the ones with people, not the demons. Talks about many of today\\'s problems including religious fanaticism, manipulation of the masses by religious authorities, preying on the fragile mindset and innate fear of most of the world\\'s population.A true must-watch, if you\\'re okay with some blood and semi-graphic violence.,Yes indeed I hate the lack of creativity and imagination its ok for those that do not watch anime however if u do go watch death note is why better...,Rough watch... how society conforms to these self proclaiming prophets is completely unbelievable. I found myself rolling my eyes more than anything. This looks like a show that will continue to leave more loose ends and end up being cancelled before there are any answers.The finale doesn\\'t leave any satisfaction and made me scoff at actually wasting my time with it.,I am currently 4 episodes in and the acting is bad, dialogue is super bad in general everything about this series is bad. Weak story, weak actor performance. I quite like korean movies and series but this here is boring bad one just ridning the \"korean wave\" we currently are undergoing. Some people say it has deeper mening etc, but theese \"subtle\" messages have been spun off in so many different ways in so many much better series and movies allredy. YAAAWN.,This show is amazing, I think people are hell-bound on the religious aspect of it. This show portrays the morality and philosphical ways of man explored in the concept of fear. I personally enjoyed it, to the extent it got me questioning life. The show uses religion as a factor which could be subtitiuted with anything else, but because there are people out there who still have faith of high begin it has a impact on them. The show develops quite late but express a need of change within society.,I felt compelled to write a review based on the negative comments. I watched this over the course of a day and a half and thought it was very good. Now I understand that not everyone will enjoy the same types of shows but in no sane world is this show a 1-4.For the reviewers that only made it through 2-3 episodes you missed the jump in the timeline. For the reviewers complaining about a lack of closure after six episodes, well thats because there will be a second season. It\\'s a cliffhanger pretty standard.I would recommend giving it a go. In my opinion it is better than most of what Hollywood has been putting out for years.,This movie story is not just completely disjointed, it is also completely unrespectful for people sensitivity without any reason of story. It is for sure the result of a movie business espionage, it try to steal some characters and distopia from the successful Squid game, like the VIPs and some other pipelines, in perfect Chinese business style \"copy and paste\" or like the American action movies, overall this is what is made of South Korea, it\\'s a copy of something which is not, always researching its own personality after the destruction of too many colonies, last USA. But let\\'s be back on the movie, not just the story is a complete mess, the Special effects are worth of a 90\\'s low budget movie, the gorillas sucks, and the shooting... It seems to be a school work made by a bad taste and low score student.I\\'m sorry for who paid to make this movie.,I gave it a high 9 because it is a type of series that will let you think and might want to absorb the message more. As you progress with it, you will slowly realize how the storyline will is almost always true for most countries that are led by fanatics of religious groups. You will realize how religion play in societal problems and how they can manipulate facts and tailor them according to their OWN standards.I really like how factual some of the scenes are and how it reflects humans while experiencing crisis. The story reflects despair, agony, and hardships and how a certain belief can be unfair for some. Again don\\'t watch this if you are not a type of cinephile who doesn\\'t want to think and loves to consume the message of a series/movie in a silver platter.Lastly, I gave this a 9 because although I love the plot, some of it, I think was patterned in a pre-existing movie/series and then constructed together. CGI wise, I think they could\\'ve done better and that goes the same with the fighting scenes.I personally believe that a season 2 will give more it more justice.,The idea is greatI am still looking where this series will lead toIt can be a great show if they can provide some logical background.If not then i just waste my time.,Okay, I\\'ve never reviewed movies/series here. But I can\\'t resist this one.*very mild spoilers beneath but it\\'s worth saving your time*1. It doesn\\'t make sense.I have watched bad series, horrible ones. But they all had an explanation, some story, whether that was sensible or not. Hellbound does not have that. Till the end, we have no freaking clue as to what these monsters are and why they send people to hell.It was implied that a lot of the people who were hellbound did not majorly \"sin\". What even is \"sin\" here? Why are these poor people thrashed around and tortured? Even if they come back at the end, it doesn\\'t get rid of the fact that they suffered badly. So it\\'s clear that the supernatural force behind this is not righteous itself.2. It\\'s all about social commentary?People keep commenting that this is not about the monsters, but about society and human nature. I\\'m sorry, are we supposed to be blown away by this revelation that humans can be terrible?? *gasp* I never considered that.WE ALREADY KNOW. We\\'ve seen this repeated in countless TV series, movies, and everyday life. The only new concept here is these big yeti monsters and they couldn\\'t explain them. So, don\\'t tell me it\\'s not about the monsters taking people to hell when the show is literally named HellBound and it very much is about the freaking monsters.Was I horrified by the actions of the Arrowhead folks and the cult? Yes. Surprised? No. That\\'s what mobs are like and it is highly likely something like that would happen.Does that mean you skimp on the storyline and pass it off as some clever angle??3. It is deeply saddening and disturbing.Now, when I say this, I don\\'t mean I can\\'t handle sadness. Squid Game had heartbreaking moments. So did Train to Busan. But those two were absolute masterpieces. Hellbound should not even be compared with them. I\\'m surprised at how many people are saying this is better than Squid Game. In my opinion, no. No it is not.This series may leave you feeling mentally exhausted.My overall review- I\\'ve watched some pretty bad series but this is one of the very few that I actually regret watching. I think it is past the redeeming point and they won\\'t be able to explain it properly anymore. But I\\'d be happy to be proved wrong.Was it scary? Yes, and disturbing. But what\\'s scarier is that it\\'s rated 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.The acting was stellar, it was a little entertaining, it was like a wreck that I watched till the end just to find out why this was happening. I got no answers.-MAJOR SPOILER ALERT-Don\\'t read beyond this if you\\'re yet to watch the series^^^^^^Let\\'s talk about that last episode.How could the baby have survived? Seriously, how? I was glad that it was alive, but come on. These monsters have huge rods as claws and they have all sorts of contraptions ready to tackle humans. You\\'re telling me that these ruthless monsters could not take apart two fragile tiny(relatively) people. What a joke.Keep in mind that they scorch bones and organs to ashes, but they couldn\\'t scorch a little extra and get to the baby? No sense.Oh, the big bad monsters suddenly got confused? I have no idea. The supernatural force was wrong? Yea, about LITERALLY EVERYTHING.~~~~~~I\\'m done. I just had to say all this at freaking 3 AM.,A pretty good series, super fast paced and mingled with lots of plot twists.However the show really didn\\'t have a proper explanation for a lot of things that were happening especially since it dealt with the concept of hell and angels of death but also condemned cults and concept of A Just God. There are talks about the second season so I\\'m assuming a lot of answers will be revealed then.Would suggest watching it if you\\'re looking for something offbeat and fast paced.,The stark number of critical user reviews here explains why there is still such a high demand for superficial cgi infested American action shows with absolutely no innovation or meaningful message except the completely oversaturated \\'hero always prevails\\' along with \\'superstar actor-wreslters?\\' like The Rock.,I watched this movie on the request of my wife , she told me that its review is great on netflix. When i saw a movie i dont like like this story. Whole move based on one thing that three giant black creatures came and destroy the sinner. The concept of angel ,hell ,God are all twisted. The angel appearing and telling the date of death , the angel appearing and taking the lives and then God make mistakes ??? I wasted more than 120 minutes on this series ! A big No to Series.,I have watched the whole thing out of curiosity, ending was bad, many things were left unexplained, I thought it would have more of an interesting storyline, vfx was great but i wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone.,This one seemed to be another promising Korean series after Squid Game with decent trialers and 1st episode. However, the story gradually became illogical and frustrating over time, such as the minimal interfering of authority over such disastrous events happening in the country, Arrowhead acted like a terrorism organisation while they should also be afraid of committing crime/sin, the stupid actions and reasoning of characters and society, slow and repetitive dialogues, etc.In short, it was a disappointment although last plot can lead to a more interesting story if the show continues.,The first episodes, I thought I was wasting my time, but after watching episode six, I was eager to see the new season of this series. I would like to know what is the reason for these monsters to send humans to hell and bring them back?,Not a regular storyline. Clearly I don\\'t understand why a lot of people hate this series. Hellbound is great about a lot of things. It\\'s very scary! Especially when the monsters are about to come. There is a lot of blood and gore which I think is appropriate if a demon is about to drag you to hell. Well, that\\'s definitely not for everyone but for me its very well done. Look how many haters on the review because they think it\\'s too much.,Very slow and boring. It is not good. I gave up 20 minutes in. Scenes last long. Not good scenes. Slow, boring - working my way up to 150 characters now.,\"I don\\'t know much about God and I don\\'t even care. But I know one thing and that is that the world belongs to us humans and we should settle our matters ourselves. Don\\'t you agree Miss Min\"\" Upholding justice and righteousness in fear of damnation. Is it truly righteous and just?\"\" We don\\'t know if it is God, it is the interpretation of some for what they think that God has said\"What I thought of, in the first ten minutes, to be a silly horror show turned out to be a remarkable dissection of organized religion. It just shredded the religious dogmas to pieces. From the concept of original sin to Messiah complex to false or for that matter any prophethood, gullibility of common men, bigotry, exploitation, papacy, religious texts and their reality, and even specific incidents in religious history like Abrahamic Sacrifise and the crucifixion and one so called miracle after the other, all were put to sword. It addresses the extremism, fundamentalism and cult mentality in a new fashion. Once you peel the superficial violence and look deeper, don\\'t be surprised to see your own image.And all of this is done subtlety but not so subtlety with a supernatural theme. It left clues along with some unanswered questions but made sure for the audience to know that an unexplained phenomena does not mean only one answer.The show has layers and layers and then some. It is portrayed as horror/sci Fi but it\\'s pure philosophy. Watch it for deeper meanings and you will love it, if your mind is still open; well, I know that being a rarity these days.A brilliant show with a last minute twist to make room for a sequel. After the horribly idiotic Squid Games, this was just a breath of fresh air. See, no matter what you believe in. It is bound to make you think, if nothing else. What could be better than that.,This series took so many twists and turns I hadn\\'t expected. I was on the edge of my seat, especially towards the end. There better be a season 2! Hellbound explores so many elements of human nature. If you enjoy cult or religious thrillers, watch this now. You won\\'t be disappointed.,I love this series so muchhh. I\\'m happy its not like a kid movie (marvel ) ,great concept with this series .Bae youngjae was sssoooooo goodddd we need him backkkkk.,I\\'m so glad netflix invest in korean series much more thrilling than hollywood kid shows and also im laughing at people who are complaining about it .Like yall know what thriller is ? We are supposed to feel the characters but guess what you can go back and watch your marvel movies .We needdd bae youngjae and chairman back together in season 2.,Let me tell you when i tell you i am addicted to series ,that\\'s mean i can\\'t stop thinking about this . Glad i find korean series its the besttt. Yall have done great job.,I watched the trailer and thought this would be a good show but instead it\\'s not. The whole cult theory is to not be a sinner and be a better person so you don\\'t go to hell but the extremist arrowheads are literally killing people and harassing them for not having the same beliefs... how tf are you going to condemn people for sinning when you\\'re dinner as well. It\\'s just a show that shows how dumb people are and how easily they get pursued.,Where do I even begin?Pointless? Yes.Acting? Forgettable.Draggy? Absolutely.CGI? Laughable.I desperately would like the time back that I spent watching this show.,I love the series interesting story many reviews are racist because of some of the people are based on Hollywood movies but thought I\\'m not an American nor Korean but the story is very interesting I loved the idea of the religion and the formation of cults in the series that can lead a society mob and how the writer hasn\\'t pour all details to makes us feel of needing the season 2.,Ok, I really enjoyed the Squid Game. However, I still tried to watch the 1st episode as objectively as I can. All I can say is that the first season made up of only 6 episodes was a 🎢 ride. There were some really unnecessary slow moments, with too much character building, etc. Overall, however, I thought the 1st season was very entertaining. On a separate note, why do the South Korean police officers only carry revolvers?!? For a country that gave us Samsung, Hyundai, LG, and Kimchi, you\\'d think they would have some pretty cool guns by now... Looking forward to the 2nd season soon!,Hellbound is a unique show that takes a lot of risks - and for me they pay off. It\\'s only 6 episodes, but spans 5 years and follows two distinct sets of characters. While the individual characters aren\\'t quite as fleshed out as they could be because of this, it\\'s the only way to tell a story this big, and they manage to pack a ton of plot into a really tight 6-episode run by focusing the story around two pivotal moments. Each episode further complicates the narrative and subverts expectations in an exciting way, all while remaining true to the characters and the decisions they have to make.The first episode isn\\'t designed to \"hook\" you with huge cliffhangers and the truth and scope of what\\'s going on is revealed slowly - the show really takes some risks here and trusts it\\'s audience a lot to not lose interest in this age of short attention spans, but stick with it and you\\'ll be rewarded.I should also note that Hellbound explores questions of faith and examines how different people choose to find meaning in the supernatural. These are complicated things to discuss in subtitles and some of the shorthand and idioms used in these conversations doesn\\'t translate 1:1. Also, some of the social issues the show is interested in are uniquely Korean - it\\'s hard to imagine police behaving the way they do in the show here in America.If you\\'re looking for a challenging show that\\'s well-written though, it\\'d be hard to do better than Hellbound. If you\\'re the kind of person who doesn\\'t want to think about religion and its role in society, you probably shouldn\\'t watch this show, as you\\'ll likely find it too challenging, like many of the reviewers here.I\\'m sorry it doesn\\'t have enough explosions or car chases for you Chad, but it\\'s weird that you feel so triggered that you have to go online and tell everyone how much you don\\'t care.,I watched this cause it\\'s highly overrated, but it turns out very disappointing, not like what I expected. The plot is too slow until it becomes BoRiNg! I gave 2 star to appreciate Yoo Ah In\\'s role, he\\'s the only one cast that played well. Sadly, he played only half of the season. None of the cases amazed me, yet it\\'s just confusing. All the questions that\\'ve been on my mind got no answer as the film goes by. I love watching fantasy thriller, but this is just too much of a dissapointment.,A tired policeman Jin Kenghun gets into the center of a mysterious religious phenomenon. He not only begins to be interested in the activities of the dangerous sect \"New Truth\", which is gaining weight and gradually driving the public crazy, but also puts up with the fact that his daughter is involved in communication with the charismatic leader of the movement. The hero investigates the cases of \"sinners\" and understands that it is pointless to fight media hysteria and collective anathema, and law enforcement agencies are unable to do anything - members of the growing sect are taking root in social networks and media platforms, turning their sermons into radical anti-social actions.,Literally made an account to say how frustrating this show was, and it\\'s so sad because it\\'s an original concept with incredible potential but horrible execution. My largest gripe is the lack of good people in the show, and how it makes people look like a bunch of lunatics with the IQ of a brick.,Oldboy is human nature this is social nature. What is difference between jejus\\'s miracle and hellbound show to make people trust god. I agree with jeung jinsu\\'s saying.,Each episode of boring 50 minutes which has complete nonsense concept.You need to wait till the end of the whole series to see something should happen but at the end nothing happens.,This is just a clusterfuck of everything and nothing. Netflix needs to up its game. What a horrible storyline which makes no sense whatsoever.I feel I wasted 6 hours just to be like tf just happened..,Great show, compelling drama mixed with brutal violence that may turn some viewers away. But for those willing to see this through it pays off emotionally and cinematically. The twists and turns keep you glued to the screen.,As an antheist, everything looked liked medieval fantasy, with whimsical, sick, twisted God of old testament doing whatever the f God wants to do like, taking life whenever God wants.Don\\'t give a f if some crooked religious leader is abusing his power, but would happily beat and tore the life out of ordinary single mom who raises two kids by herself.Don\\'t give a f if large gang beats and kills people, but have no problem telling a teenage girl that she will go to hell within few seconds and again beat and tore the life out of her.It is twisted show, showing the sick face of God (or supernatural being), and also those living in society who would use that God or supernatural situation for their advantage.Loved it, and cannot wait for second season.,Very slow and dragged on without any substance. Couldn\\'t get past episode 3. Why are people comparing this to squid game? Weird plot, bad acting and none of the motives made sense.,You can really tell the reviewers who didn\\'t actually finish the series... It\\'s told in 2 acts of 3 episodes each. So there\\'s a sort of reset at episode 4 in the format of a time jump. All of the \"slowness\" or \"boring dialogue\" is part of the story that leads into what was to me a very good finale. This isn\\'t a non stop action or horror thriller. Think more religious event drama like The Leftovers, but with more violence. Can\\'t wait for season 2.,First the show.Well paced, slow start and creating a base for the narrative, so it has Dept something many people are not used to any more, and after that is goes in to a crescendo of violence, emotions, doubt and mystery.Watch pass the first couple of episodes, which are undoubtably slow.Second, the reviews.If you are a religious fanatic, don\\'t watch it. If you are a \"marvel\" fanatic, don\\'t watch it. If you are neither, give it a try it\\'s a great show.,The one clunky part of this is the CGI demons, which are almost laughably bad, but the acting is decent, there are some twists in the plot, and I\\'m hoping to see a second season.,I really enjoyed the show. Although it is a bit slow-paced, but the way the team built up the story is amazing. The show is overall entertaining. Many reviewers gave it 1 star, which is humiliating. I respect their opinion but don\\'t mislead others. The concept is new. It is highly recommended.,Summary::\\r\\nPhenomenon: An apparition face appears suddenly, and tells a person that he/she will die in after X time(Here X could be as low as 10 seconds to as high as 20 years).After X time passes, three monsters appear, brutally beatdown, burn the person and disappear. Happens publicly; can be recorded, played on TV and the monsters are pretty much invincible.Suicide doesn\\'t change anything, at set time monsters appear, pull the soul out of dead body and do the same.The series focuses mainly on the repercussions of said phenomenon, with characters being sort of disposable assets for forwarding the events. Is there a main character? Not absolutely sure even after season end.Series explores religious opportunism, weakness of human law, morality, character, psyche and the helplessness of the individual to stand up for personal rights and freedom.The series is boring though.You never get to know a character deeply enough to find them relatable.Certain aspects are never explored.Is the phenomenon global? How are governments tackling this issue.Any alternative theories to what is happening and why?How many people face this everyday? Are the no. Of cases rising or stable?No one has tried to take an experiment based approach to avoid the monsters? Go underground, go sky diving, go high speed biking. How far long has one been able to avoid getting killed by running, How invulnerable are the monsters? High caliber guns, bombs, missiles, Acid, Lava, Poison gas, holy water. Anything works?For a series this slow and long. The number of questions avoided makes the slow pace increasingly frustrating.The cliffhanger ending of season 1 will bring me back for season 2, but this series figures near the bottom of the list of series that I have watched so far.,It\\'s a different concept ,,perfect way to describe, superstition of religion and motivate to develop critical thinking of thoughts . In first few episodes it may seems boring but at end you will enjoy it . Waiting for second season kudo\\'s to team.,I\\'ve just finished the series and come for the review section. I\\'m shocked but not surprised with the negative reaction towards this series.Of course the audience that live in secular countries might can\\'t relate for what happen through the story. In most of Asian countries that a lot of them still devoted with religions and any superstitious occurence. When majority of the has been really skeptical with law enforcer, whose made really poor publicity with their arrogance and injustice. While the skepticism grows, they turned their believes with God\\'s and capital punishment. Everything\\'s just get into grey area, where blind fanaticism just getting tense. This series is actually hard to watch, bleak and depressing. And what makes me feel unsettled that this most likely happen in my country. This series has really multi-layered social commentary that are really happening in our society.Hellbound is just not another Final Destination, One Missed Call or Death Note as most reviewer compared. This is brutal, satire and saddening.,A lot of nonsense characters. Waste time to watch. Seems like try to make an interesting plot with out any reason. Feeling like watch Grade B movie. Okay to watch if no serious.,I must admit the first few episodes did put me off but I went in a little deeper and I was quite happy what I came out with. I\\'d say from the 4th episode it gets a lot better. Unfortunately ends on the 6th. The first three episodes will pull out of people off with it\\'s poor acting chops and really shoddy CG. But if you like fantastical stories like youd find in animes or comics, you\\'ll feel right at home with this.,This is underrated. Should be 8 and above. The series picks up pretty quickly, tries to expose the bad parts of humanity and keeps you equally interesting with unexpected scenes and outcomes. Waiting for season 2.,Apart from the question, what is really going on? The rest of the show is outright bad and I\\'m someone who loves this genre. The acting is ok but I\\'ve seen much better. There is some cgi effects that come in the form of the monsters but that\\'s also kinda basic for today\\'s standards. The major issue however is the plot which is totally and completely boring for me. You just watch and watch and watch expecting something cool and amazing to happen but that\\'s unfortunately never comes to pass. 1/10.,I think negative ratings comes from offended white christians (who also happens to be racists for some reason, and treat Asian cinema as something subpar) or from people that expected plain action and offended by drama and feelings.Its great series, very brutal too, it is based on webtoon and you can see it. Some moments were even too brutal for me even though I used to it.,The story is about broadening your outlook about things that can\\'t be explained scientifically and considered supernatural. Instead of labelling every supernatural event as an act of God or an act of cleansing the sins of humans ,we should consider alternate versions as well , instead of suppressing the voice of people who try to decipher it. Asking questions doesn\\'t make anyone against any religion . The story is about not having blind faith in the name of God .,The worst TV series I\\'ve ever watched... The story was bad, and twisted. I thought it would be entertaining when watched the trailer but at the end I just fast forward most of scenes.,I don\\'t get all the bad reviews to be honest, I was engaged from scene one, and I couldn\\'t keep myself from watching all of it at once, an amazing show and I advise all sci-fi fans to watch it, you will enjoy it a lot kept me feeling bad for sometime though.,It is NOT a sci-fi thriler, it is NOT a ghost story, it is NOT a horror movieIt is an allegory of modern organized religion.The story goes like this. There is an explained magical phenomenon happening in a modern society. Nobody can explain it. People are dying. People get panicked. Then some self-proclaimed deacons enter the scene and assure that they are the God\\'s messenger. This is exactly how religion is formed.Now lets go back 2000 years ago. People then thought that they were the most modern society. They saw a new unexplained phenomenon that then-science could not explain (consider plague, consider some guy went into a coma and came to life 3 days later). Some self proclaimed deacons told everyone to follow their orders because God told them so. Does it sound familiar? This is the story of all organized religions in every era of human history in every corner of the earth.Please, please, do not watch this masterpiece as a horror/thriller/sci-fi movie. You will be disappointed. Rather consider the monsters as an unexplained phenomenon that the science of a modern society can\\'t explain. Rest of the story is self-evident. Initially, people saw that sinners were dying. Then some followers started dying. Then a baby died. Clearly, past/present sins had nothing to do with it. On the other hand, the deacons were quite clearly conspiring to keep themselves in power without thinking of sins. What does the situation resemble? Religion.I doubt if the creators will ever confess to it, because the religious fanatics still exist.,I wanna take my time back and have a big question, how can it be on top??? Bad plot, ridiculous situations. The \"angels\" are more like evils. All of messages you can conclude are negative.Avoid this film!!!!!!!!!,This one is so annoying and disturbing. No cohesion, random things, stupid characters. Mainly I felt so disturbed about the existence of this masked guy yelling at tv. Worst thing I have ever seen.,I usually don\\'t leave reviews here, but I had to for this one. There is so much injustice in this show with very little to no resolution at all that will leave you angry and frustrated by the end of it. Every character on this show is stupid and make decisions that make no sense. Don\\'t waste your time and go watch something else.,People complaining about having no explanation on why the supernatural events are happening just don\\'t understand what the show is about. The show is way more a critic of human behaviors and philosophical dilemmas than a serie about supernatural stuff or an action serie.Just like The Squid Game, it is NOT a serie for everyone. Don\\'t watch it because you see it in the Top 10 or because it\\'s trendy. You need to have the stomach for it, and it could make you very depressed so if you are not in an happy place in your life, my advice would be to wait before you get better before watching this. Watch it because you want and/or love something that is not like other american series and movies. If despite that you watch it then come on IMDb to give it a low score because \"it\\'s boring\", \"dialogue are stupid /acting is bad\" (but not watching it in original language), \"CGI is just average\" (yeah, they MIGHT not have the budget of a Marvel movie; it was still fine IMO), or because they dont tell enough about what\\'s going on (it\\'s just season 1, and again, not the main point the creators are trying to make there).People in a nutshell: \"we want different movies/series, not the rehashed remakes or dumb action stuff\". Filmmaker creates try to make new IPs, with fresher ideas, Netflix export int\\'l series so we can discover more styles. Same people: \"wth is going on! Boring! Confusing! Gimme back my remakes\".,I am giving 1 star because they show waste my 6 hours of time. First 2 episodes were OK but after episode 2 i thought i was watching another show. No story line.,God, intention, interpretation, salvation, human world.Unrealistic, All too unrealistic events\\r\\nPhilosophical, All too philosophical stories\\r\\nRealistic, All too realistically articulated masterpiece!!!,I really enjoyed watching the full 6 episodes. I felt this TV Show deserves better reviews than Squid Game. The first 2-3 episodes could be a bit boring, but be patient and watch till the end.,If you expected a time killing series from trailer, I warn you that this is a much heavier series to digest.The series is divided into two sections. You may find first episode of each section a little slow, but if you are immersed into the story, you won\\'t notice that too much.Story-wise, never seen anything like this and it keeps on driving. Great acting from main characters.,Concept is good but it failed in overall execution and turn out to be a slow and boring !! Even the characters are so bored to act !! Not at all recommended.,The plot is highly illogical, people\\'s actions are illogical, elite team of fighters losing to a delusional man with a knife. Baby not getting incinerated. The show just doesn\\'t make any sense.,You can watch this if you haven\\'t watched the trailer I guess, wish I hadn\\'t as it revealed alot of the series. Wasn\\'t too impressed with this one. Almost all episodes are kind of similar with an unexplained ending.,Honest review. Its an extremely intriguing drama. It does get a little tedious at some parts bt i feel that the level of kdramas has jz been increasing. First squid games nd then this. Plus the actors have done an excellent job.

It\\'s based on a \\'web toon\\', whatever that is, and I went into it with a few reservations that were quickly blown away from the end of the first instalment. This ten-episode, hour long series explores the lives of a group of residents at a tower block who wake up one day to find the world destroyed and rampaging mutated monsters killing anyone who ventures out of doors. Even worse, some of their own are infected and in the process of becoming monsters themselves!Handsomely shot and mounted, this possesses all of the quality acting you expect from Korean cinema and television, and the realistically-drawn character portraits of people you don\\'t always like or love but who ring true to life: the conflicted, suicidal teenager; the stroppy guitarist; the masculine firefighter; the scarred gangster with a talent for torture. Interesting character development is interspersed with outlandish action and fight scenes every episode as the dwindling characters encounter one nightmarish creation after another. The CGI effects aren\\'t meant to be photorealistic but I grew to love them anyway as they fit the show\\'s fantastic landscape. Twisty, turning, surprising and grisly, with a consistent quality from beginning to end, this might well be the TV show of the year.,The story rushes into assorted monster attacks too quickly without establishing an emotional connection with the characters or background story. Not scary or exciting if you don\\'t care for the characters. Unusual for a Korean series to lack an emotional connection. This series has a one dimensional story with less depth than usual. Only later in flashbacks do you get to know the characters but it\\'s too late by then. The viewer is plunged into a post apocalyptic gory mess quite quickly without enough explanation and the attacks feel repetitive and monotonous. And the gratuitous violence is out of place in a Korean series.\\r\\nVisually the monsters and effects look good. The cast is good and likeable with 18 Again\\'s Lee Do Hyun, Love Alarm\\'s Song Kang, Lee Jin Wook surprisingly good as a tough guy and Park Kyu Yung of It\\'s Okay.\\r\\nI prefer Kingdom or the excellent Odd Family Zombie for Sale to Sweet Home.,Sweet Home (2020) is a Korean horror television series available on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a virus outbreak that turns people into monsters. The storyline evolves around a group of survivors inside a residential high rise building while chaos takes place outside.The writing for this is very inconsistent. The first four episodes were out of this world A+ action and horror scenes. It was so fun. I thought this show was Amazing out of the gate. However, the storyline quickly shifts from the cool monsters to the humans hybrids and their conflicting feelings about the surviving humans. Overall this series had a lot of potential and falls apart halfway through. The series was a 10/10 through 4-5 episodes and then 3/10 the last 5 so I\\'d give this a 5.5/10.,Korean Drama \\'Sweet Home\\' has awful CGI, but it makes up with the on-point atmosphere. The settings, the costumes, the music, the performances, everything is and feels perfect, as the group of residence is trying to survive. However, this season felt more like the introduction, as we start to get to know each character and bond with them, without, nevertheless, getting too deep into the mystery of what is happening and why and how to move forward. Still, this season sets strong foundations for those to come.In addition, everything is well constructed, with enough screen time for each character and each storyline. The pace is also perfect for the action element of the story. Finally, the performances were all quite emotional.So, overall, 7 out of 10.,Sweet Home: South-Korean TV series, mostly set in an apartment block. There is a conspiracy at work here, some state actors new things were wrong before the outbreak. People transform into different types of monsters, zombies, giant spiders, gel creatures, shape-shifters. A motley crew try to survive in the block, infighting, suspicion are rife but people also co-operate. Dark in more ways than one with the tower block interiors. Some of the back stories are a bit soapish but others contain elements of existential terror. Some great fight scenes with the mnsters but there are also tangles with marauders and soldiers. Great fun. Multipe directors and writers based on the Naver webtoon of the same name by Kim Kan-bi and Hwang Young-chan. On Netflix. 8/10.,This show feels like the same kind of surreal nightmares I have after eating pepperoni and sausage pizza too late before bed. surreal, even for horror.,After watching Squid Game and Alice in Borderland I thought this would be something similarly great.But when I heard the line \"Go commit suicide somewhere else\" I was like wow, this is introducing garbage characters from episode one. And of course, the main character just takes it.And that\\'s just it, the entire thing relies too heavily on the characters, but most of them are forgettable trash, and nothing too interesting happens to get you invested.It\\'s all confusing too, I had to search online for explanations as to what happened exactly, since even after watching the final episode I was confused.So yeah, surprisingly disappointing.,Enjoyable, but somewhat odd. The creatures are great, not always realistic looking. That\\'s not what\\'s odd. What\\'s odd is overly long shots of people just looking or staring with no expression on their faces.Maybe it\\'s a cultural thing but no one really seems to react to anything with fear, even curiosity. Things just happen in front of them and they just stand there staring at it. A 10-ft tall thing with elongated legs and arms and everyone just stands there going, what is that? And then as it approaches them, nobody moves they just stand there. Its it\\'s bizarre.A lot of characters are introduced, but you start to be able to distinguish who\\'s who and what they\\'re doing and who\\'s brave, who\\'s a coward, who probably needs to be killed by the monsters, and who you\\'re going to enjoy being killed by the one of the monsters.Another strange aspect to this series is Marlboro Man. the dude in the suits what\\'s up with him is he infected, is he not infected, or did he just happen to be caught up in this when he was robbing somebody???I\\'m three episodes in and I can\\'t tell yet. Stuck in the house during the pandemic you could do worse.,\"It\\'s not a disease; it\\'s a curse.\" And the series is not a horror story, though it is, but an allegory. And it is beautiful, frightening, tragic, compassionate.......and brilliant.,In a building besieged by humans who have turned into monsters which take the form of their hidden desires a group of people join forces to survive. Well acted and a good storyline which is based on a web toon which is apparent in the direction which focuses on reaction and shock in short stints. You might want to view it with the lights on as the monsters are pretty scary.,The story is addicting enough to make you want to know what happens at the end. There are some attempts at character development to provide some reasoning for the motivations. It is Return of the Living Dead, X-Men and the Mist.\\r\\nThere are many comments about the horrible CGI and it is true. The CGI was almost at a level of a talented teenager with a laptop and Adobe. Since the series has certain level of dark comedy, I was able to look past that. I was not able to look past that this 10-hour series could have very easily been a very good 2.5 hour movie. There was extremely amount of filler that did not provide any additional context to the move.Other big problem was editing which is the reasoning for my 4 stars. It is disjointed to say the least. It is almost like they taped entire scenes and then cut out the bloopers or mistakes and stitched together what was left with reshooting anything. There are many jumps, skips and entire characters appearing and not appearing and darkness that makes it hard to know what is going on(think Game of Thrones White Walker battle in Season 8). A five second action scene can have 15+ edits and you end up confused. Other big issue....the ending, I have no idea what happened in the last 15 minutes.For some people this may be a 7 or 8 star while for most \\'adults\\' it will be 6 at best.,If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic themes, monsters, and gore, then this series probably got your attention. It got mine.Sweet Home (2020) is heavy on gore, suspense, and drama. The gore is self-explanatory. The other two need in-depth details.The suspense is what kept me going. Not only because of the thrilling moments but also the curiosity to know what will happen next. Every episode does a great job of raising a question, a concern, and leaving answers for later. This kept my attention and gave me the motivation to keep watching until the end.Finally, the drama. This series is great about portraying the drama involved in this whole situation. And the character acting is outstanding. You care for people, you hate some people, you cheer for the heroes. In the end, I think this is all about humans, even though the main problem is the monsters.As for the monsters, I have to mention the cheap CGI. It definitely breaks your immersion. You need to numb your mind to this and watch it for the plot. In contrast, the practical effects are well done.I would definitely recommend it to everyone, but I know this is not for everyone. Casual watchers will not like this series. Gore and monster lovers will like it, maybe.,If this was an American series it would get torn apart and all you have to do is look at the ratings of any of similar shows that have been on TV other than WD or AHS and even those are have lower overall ratings. An anti American bias by Americans taints every bit of pop culture this gets a boost it deserves simply by it not coming from the US. I love this show it\\'s not only a great horror show it\\'s also an excellent mystery and has spots of comic relief. The story the acting the pace and its presentation are all excellent and while the CGI is not the best it\\'s good enough that it\\'s not unintentionally funny.,This Human - Monster related series is fun to watch. Only drawback was that some scenes felt dragged on or else, this show is good enough.,9/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean science fiction, horror drama with 10, 44-59 minute episodes.An introvert after extreme bullying, teenager Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kant) loses his entire family in a car accident.

The group supper gives her the strength to stand up to him.Cha Jin-ok (Kim Hee-jung) continued attempts to open the door and escape in order to locate and save her teen daughter repeatedly puts the group in jeopardy.Kim Su-yeongm ((HeoYool) is a small child (9 Years Old) who along with her brother Kim Yeong-su (Choi Go; 6-year-old) lost their father when he was attacked by a monster while attempting to repel down the side of the building to get them food.Son Hye-in (Kim Gook-hee) considers her Pomerania; Bom, like her child and continually carries it.Im Myung-sook (Lee Bong-ryun) devastated since losing her child when the baby\\'s stroller got loose and rolled into traffic.Choi Yoon-jae (Go Geon-Han) pretends to be kind to hide among the group from Sang-wook. But he is a human monster of another sort, a Child Predator.If Movies in the horror genre are your thing then this will likely fit the bill. The monsters were definitely scary and horrific and the fact that the people turn into monsters was in and of itself frightening . That type of transformation was reminiscent of the American movie \"The Thing\" though only vaguely so. It was interesting the way the people both had to work together while not completely trusting each other to be able to make it through. I liked that there was that central character, the teenage boy, and that he was unique and that he had the monster in him yet was largely able to control it. The series was well paced throughout most of it until towards the end when it got a little chaotic and felt like a lot of people were dying very rapidly. There were also aspects that were not well explained such as why the fire fighter character was suddenly with the military at the very end. The fact that she was working with them had been revealed earlier but it did not seem like she had given them what they wanted enough that she would\\'ve been able to join them completely. The gangster guy was very different in the television series than in the webtoon where he was more of a goofy character and much more likable. For the most part they stuck to the webtoon enough that it was clear that it was made based on it and yet deviated enough to make it work in the television format. They left it open for more seasons as everything was not wrapped up and in the fact there is additional story line in the webtoon indicates that there is story left for more episodes to the series or another season. I\\'m not sure why they decided to only do 10 episodes, 16 or more episodes would have allowed for a more complete telling of the story.,So bad that you will fall asleep. Is so slow, bad cgi, bad korean show. All the korean show are over acting. And i don\\'t know why imdb now is forcing to write a review longer. It sucks.,Imagine the most miserable, unlikeable people on earth stuck in a residential building while random monsters go around with zero explanation.The monsters are pretty cool but the characters kill it. There is zero reason to give a flying crap about a single one of them. Every one is nasty for no reason. The stupid dancer runt, the crazy lady, the incel loser. Who wants to look at these imbeciles.Pass.,The trailer had me hooked, and I was looking forward to this. The show is visually great, IMO. There\\'s a decent amount of CGI that\\'s hit/miss but various practical visual effects were done really well. The show is very colorful for almost 10 episodes of scenes trapped inside a building. The music was good too, minus the repetitive Imagine Dragons song. So if you like to enjoy stuff like that, give this a shot.\\r\\nOne of things that\\'s a plus about Korean movies and shows in general is that they easily blend genres. They make you get so invested into the characters in thrillers/horrors that the genre also becomes emotional - in a good way. Sweet Home has A LOT of characters but it takes time to get invested. But since it\\'s a tv show and since there were so many people, i think it\\'s okay to consume that much time.\\r\\nThe monsters too, are very different from each other, unlike what we\\'d have seen in most zombie-type movies, they too had different personalities.\\r\\nThe story though, was a slight let-down for me, I personally found that there were inconsistencies which breaks the suspense/tension/sense of urgency. I felt that there were several questions that were left unanswered towards the end of the show, which was also a let down, but maybe that\\'s just me. Will there be an S2? Will they answer all those questions? I don\\'t know, and the show doesn\\'t end in a way that would make me wait in anticipation for S2 and for those answers. I might not even watch it, answers or not.\\r\\nBut overall, something slightly different to watch. I thought that it was visually really good, great music/sound too! Watch this if you\\'re bored and have nothing else to watch. 10 hours is a lot of commitment.,Some of the actors were great but this fell short of my expectations. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'ve watched several shows with a similar premise, but this just didn\\'t capture my attention. And I can tell that this was adapted from a webtoon because most shows adapted from webtoons end up lacking in some way.,The idea of this series is great. Instead of zombies you get people turning into these crazy monsters. First seven episodes are survival horror and the last 3 are straight up Game of Thrones/Walking Dead if you know what I mean. It just gets dark, gruesome and sad really quick.What I liked the most about this series is that it isn\\'t the usual stuff. It\\'s like a mix of 21 days later, meets resident evil, meets the last of us meets Marvel comics. It has a lot of good themes going for it that makes it worth watching if any of the above appeal to you.I will say that watching this it seemed like a single season was good enough. I\\'m not sure how adding a season 2 would go with so many good characters now gone. At least for me everybody I liked was dead at the end so there was no point to watching the story further. I guess it really did hit a walking dead point.,So this is definitely one of those shows that people will either love or hate. I feel like you get a pretty good idea of the tone, atmosphere, and direction right from the very first episode, so if you dislike the first episode then I would not continue watching.\\r\\nYes, the CGI isn\\'t the best, but it\\'s also not the worst I\\'ve seen either.\\r\\nThe core of this show is this group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing.All that being said, I really and unexpectedly loved this show. The weirdness of it intrigued me in the first episode, and by episode 3 I was fully hooked. The characters are really, really great and you can\\'t help but root for them to survive. I loved the soundtrack, especially the use of Imagine Dragons \"Warrior.\" I can\\'t really explain why I loved this show so much, it was just this perfect combination of weird and exciting and gory that kept me completely immersed until the very last second. I really hope they give this a second season because there was a lot left unexplained!,I think it\\'s well done and looks interesting but after 3 episodes I just don\\'t find myself caring to watch anymore. It\\'s not bad, it just doesn\\'t really seem to be anything I haven\\'t seen before. Perhaps it\\'s got a little more \"column A\" and a little less \"column B\" but it doesn\\'t feel fresh or novel, which isn\\'t in and off itself a bad thing, and I\\'ve seen enough of this ilk to not need to see more at this point.,Katana oppar is daddy af. But seriously, The concept is actually pretty strong, mutated monsters with unique skills is interesting, but the story is just bleh and the sfx is passable. It\\'s pretty obvious they want to make this into a long run series so everything just feels dragged so bad, you can skip five episodes and still pretty much gets it. The characters? Omfg the characters are just god awful, the main characters are overly edgy, the supporting characters are overly lame, both have anime logic and sensibility and overall unbearably annoying.If you don\\'t like edgy manhwa you won\\'t like this. Also i LOLed every time a wild \\'imagine dragons\\' appear.,During lockdown and due to COVID, there is a real shortage of video entertainment coming out of Hollywood these days; as such, I have started watching foreign tv shows that still seem to be coming out. I am extremely glad that I found this gem of a tv show to watch! It is literally top notch! Beyond some of the foreign cultural items in this show, I literally had no problem understanding most aspects of this show. In fact it\\'s better than a lot of the stuff coming out of Hollywood these days!The acting is decent. There are many supporting actors in this show and they all did fairly well also. The cinematography was really top notch with beautiful snow scenery and post apocalyptic city scapes.\\r\\nA good part of this show included cgi monsters and while these were clearly not realistic, they were realistic enough for me to look beyond this small failing. If the cgi were done in the west using the best cgi we have it still would have been difficult to achieve realism in this film as it is filled with so many monsters.This is definitely worth the watch and I watched the entire series binge style over a two day period. 8/10 is a great rating for a non western show! See this!,Just finished watching this show. I must say , at first I was thinking hmm should I actually watch this. Then I gave it a go and didn\\'t regret at all. Loved the characters, music, the gore element, tonnes of blood thrown in ,with a great story and some over the top monster action.\\r\\nI am sure they have to come up with Season 2 now. Watch this you won\\'t regret, something different on TV rather than the usual boring PC stuff.,I can give max 6.5/10 only because the idea of different monster types are only copies from many movies and dramas. The story is just average, nothing to brag on and similar stories to all same types of dramas and movies.They should make better dramas from new stories and not just copied from others.I dont suggest to pay for this dramas because they are so many other better dramas.,The story arc and plot are random and chaotic. Whatever seems to fit at the moment. The scene cuts were spasmodic. But it was engaging enough for me to watch to the end, even though I was debating whether to continue a few episodes in. Once I got use to the whatever-goes mentality, I could enjoy it.,Quite truthful to the original story. They didn\\'t wrapped thing so much, so that\\'s good too.\\r\\nCGI are ok, acting is good, filming is really good.,It\\'s good, but forgettable. Some much exciting parts, but there\\'s much filler and long flashbacks that is not really necessary. Not anxious for a second season, but I\\'d watch.,I really love this series so far the monsters are creepy and very frightening in the whole plot is just awesome. You have to check it out you have to see it to believe it. Best Asian horror series I\\'ve seen in a long long time.,This is better than most English language horror/monster shows by far the characters might not be incredible but the production value and monster design is incredible I\\'ve not seen anything this good looking outside of American cinema even the monsters in stranger things look terrible compared to this.\\r\\nEven if you hate reading subtitles or whatever this rises above the rest it doesn\\'t drag there\\'s not too much talking so give it a go.,The ideas and premise shown in Sweet Home aren\\'t new. You have people turn into monsters and basically causing the end of the world as we knew it. I like the idea of how the humans are turning and being affected in different ways by this I guess you may call it possession.Unfortunately the execution makes it all feel completely fake. It\\'s not just the CGI that makes it look fake. It\\'s also how the transformation happens, how people act and even the changes themselves.Just to give a quick example on why this feels fake. Even though it isn\\'t said when exactly it\\'s happening towards the end of the first season we can see it starting to snow. So it plays around late autumn and early winter. This means usually it\\'s rather cold outside. Except for one comment made by a kid no one ever refers to it being cold outside or how winter and snow may affect them. Winter in an apocalyptical event is usually a pretty serious issue. Here it\\'s not even considered.In general food and water seem to be just some minor inconvenience that are also only mentioned once and then never again.The show is focused on human interaction and drama and unfortunately fails there too as the characters aren\\'t feeling real for the most part and I\\'d call them one-dimensional.Towards the end of season one they also go for a very big cliché which is often found in zombie movies and honestly it\\'s just not believable. In addition early on the monsters are established as a considerable threat. However the show shifts the focus away from the threat of the monsters and suddenly they barely make any appearances and are only a nuisance instead of an actual threat. You got to have your human drama...One more thing that really bothered me, was that throughout the whole season we stay in that one big apartment building. I still know nothing about how that building is even structured. We\\'re jumping around between places within the building and often (especially in later episodes) it\\'s not clear where the characters actually are within the building. And btw. with all the destruction going on there apparently was no real issue with getting electricity and that especially is not really believable.Honestly I wanted to like the show and I watched through season one within one week. Throughout it my rating was constantly going up and down between 3/10 and 7/10 because it has a few good scenes. Unfortunately looking at the overall result and also considering the poor choice and placement of the soundtrack at times I can\\'t rate it higher.,Netflix will probably ruin this like all of it\\'s good shows by canceling it too soon. Like literally anything worthwhile is cancelled and they renew crap.\\r\\nBut highly recommend this,Got me hooked from episode 1!\\r\\nGreat weekend binge. Tension and action packed series. It\\'s a crazy ride!\\r\\nAfter 4 episodes it shifts focus on the drama of surviving rather than fighting the monsters (which rarely appear anymore). Overal it was a good show, with good acting and the best was the music and the action sequences.,I was really impressed by the first few episodes, but series start to go down very quickly after that. It seemed like they\\'ve spent most of their budget on the first few episodes, because after that it\\'s almost nothing but people sitting around, talking and crying. Lots and lots of crying. Newly introduced monster designs were crappy and sub part, in comparison to the beginning.I just hope, that if this show gets the second season, they\\'ll get more money to bring in some new cool looking monster designs, rather than focusing on people fighting people, like they did as the season progressed.,Just the way a horror series should be with that jump and yell out factors, I love it!!!,Terrible CGI\\r\\nBoring drab lifeless acting\\r\\nNo emotion in the characters\\r\\nAnd just terrible bad ugly fake cgi.The quality is just too poor to enjoy on my nice tv.,Its cringy as can be and I\\'ve had friends getting me to watch redo of healer. If you don\\'t know what it is don\\'t go looking seriously. I couldn\\'t care less about any of these characters other then the gangster and maybe the man building things.Every single time there is an action scene they start playing Imagine Dragons - Warriors in the background and it doesn\\'t fit at all, its like they signed a contract to get rights to play it for free but they had to play it 10 times so every episode.The entire message it looks like is willpower and not giving into desire.Its definitely not a 6 or higher, anyone who thinks this is a masterpiece is high on kpop bands probably. I like Korean films like Train to Busan and Alive but this is garbage.,This would have made a good three hour movie, but it had too much time to get lost in itself. By the seventh episode or so I was losing interest, but stayed with it until the end, which provided no resolution at all.,First of all, watch it with subtitles because dubbing is terrible and original language is always best. I watched the first episode because I got bored and love these types of shows, then found myself 5 episodes in and really liking it. I would rate the first half of this show a high 8/10 even with some sketchy CGI and over acting. The second half starts to go down hill and gets very long winded with far less monsters and gore and more long, drawn out drama. By the end, it\\'s more drama than anything. So I would rate the second half more of a 5 or 6/10. The premise is that people are turning into all sorts of monsters....no monster ever the same and at first there is no known cause for it. This show follows the survivors and monsters stuck in a very large apartment building. As the show moves on, you realize it\\'s not an infectious disease like with zombies, but I won\\'t say more. The CGI is sometimes great, then goes totally flat and looks absolutely horrible. Overall, this is a very enjoyable show to watch with a very unique premise behind it. I look forward to season 2 should they make one.,Please do not pay attention to the people who read the webtoon. This series is perfect and I can see it getting way better in the upcoming seasons. The writer did not shy from providing the most authentic realistic flow of events possible even when it hurt. I enjoyed the lead in this series. His state of mind fits the mood. Overall, an incredible work. I can\\'t wait for season 2.,By far one of the best show Netflix put out in a minute.Was a bit sceptical at first and didn\\'t know what to expect but then when everything unfolds this show really takes off. Can\\'t wait for season 2.,This is definitely worth a watch . It\\'s entertaining and good fun! I like the fact as it\\'s dubbed into English so I don\\'t have to read those pesky subtitles . Some people state that they prefer the subtitles but the translation isn\\'t very good anyway ( as often it doesn\\'t make sense ) so imo it\\'s better to have the dubbing .( You also miss people\\'s expressions and the action because you\\'re too busy reading the subs!)\\r\\nApart from that , it\\'s a good watch!,Another shameful project of worst content maker, NETFLIX.,There is room for improvement and the story is a bit lacking, but the original Idea works and the zombie variety adds a fun twist. More fun than scary, but good fun.,It wasn\\'t bad and it wasn\\'t good. For anyone out there who has ever taken anti-depressants in your life, you know how they don\\'t really make you feel happy or sad? ... how they just kind of create a lack of emotion entirely? That\\'s pretty much exactly how this show makes you feel.. like you don\\'t know whether to keep watching or turn it off or why they even bothered in the first place.There was zero heart and soul put into this. Reminded me of a project where nobody really cared about it and they were more focused on getting it done rather than take the time to connect the story to their audience.This is the show equivalent to eating cold 2-day old leftovers from Olive Garden. Like.. sure it still tastes good I guess.. sort of... I mean I think? Let\\'s just say it\\'s passable but I certainly need to have something better tomorrow to make up for it.,Probably worst Korean series ever watched.\\r\\nFinished it in 2 days fast forwarded after 1st episode . totally not worth to watch ..all girls look like same ..few male characters look like same hardluto recognise them.plus whole serie in one building make it worst ..save your time don\\'t start else u will watch till end to find some this lol,Nessa analise me baseei em 5 importantes pontos: Enredo, desenvolvimento, personagens, estética e entretenimento.Enredo: 2/2.Desenvolvimento: 2/2.Estética: 2/2.Personagens: 2/2.Entretenimento: 2/2.,This Kdrama series which is adapted from webtoon comics. A survival monster apocalypse series where the plot isn\\'t very deep, But I still enjoyed since the drama has its own unique side.Monsters had good designs but the cgi made them look really fake.It wasn\\'t that bad though.,The story is all over the place. I don\\'t see how this show is getting such good reviews. I really wanted to like it but gave up after 5 episodes. Has some pretty cool visual effects but that\\'s about it.,The only thing worse than this show is that it should never have had an episode 2,Wow what a pilot . Thrilling from episode 1 . A love the video game visuals although sometimes its just bad and that monster from episode 1 was terrifying. One more bad thing is the music selection . The first and second episodes were the best so far . The third and fourth were slower,Tldr; It was more of a suspense and teary eyed jerker. Everyone waiting on Season 2 before really giving it a \"Yay\" or \"Nay.\" If anything, at least watch for Lee Si-Young\\'s amazing back abs, which I didn\\'t even know was possible. I had to rewind that part to make sure I wasn\\'t hallucinating-lol.If you looking for something that has great Action? This isn\\'t it, you be better off watching a Shonen Anime or John Wick.You want some Romance? It is almost non-existent even though love is thick in the air, they don\\'t try to progress further than that.Scary? It definitely have its\\' horror elements, but I can think of scarier things like the 13 ghost or Exorcist. Out of the 3 categories I mentioned so far, it does this the best; while mixing in drama and sadness. If anything, what hooks u from episode to episode, is to uncover the mystery as into why everything is so screwed up.It reminds me a lot of #Alive except, instead of Zombies you have people turning into different types of Monsters; and there is a MUCH bigger cast of characters. With the main protagonist giving you Kaneki vibes from Tokyo Ghoul.Lastly, be prepared to be left on a cliffhanger, if Netflix doesn\\'t give it a Season Two, we are screwed. Overall I think it is average at best, but I still enjoyed watching it and would watch Season Two. To see if it gets better, before dropping it. I think it could have just done better in several other categories, like the ACTION! That was the biggest let down and the 2nd was Romance. I\\'m like screaming at the screen, \"Just freaking kiss already,\" at multiple moments, even up to the very end.,I found this series through the manhua based on it and was shocked when I found out that it was produced and created, I didn\\'t expect something like Sweet Home to get a Live Action release when not even an animation of it had been done.And I like it, shockingly enough.Usually Live Action adaptions of works in manga/manhua/comic/book form these days I have a visceral dislike for as they\\'re usually terrible, but this adapts part of the story well.Lets get to the deets tho, the actors are fine, they\\'re usually as believable as possible for what they are playing though some of it comes across as a little hammy to my uncultured Western ears, it might be decent for Korean TV/Movies but I wouldn\\'t know, this is literally the first piece of Live Action Korean cinema I\\'ve seen and like I said I like it. (well except for some of the portrayals, that woman clearly going crazy with the virus at the start giving the poor guard the rotten fish annoyed me to no end)Now we get to a little bit of the problems though.The series doesn\\'t give time to let things breathe, the way things go in the series it\\'s a VERY fast ride through the plot from beginning to end and in that quickness, there\\'s a lack of needed connection for certain characters, leaving emotional deaths to be less than thrilling and the eventual end to be kind of anticlimactic.I would love to see more of this universe even though the manhua as (as far as I know) finished.In itself, it\\'s a fun little zombie movie with some original ideas, while they\\'re zombies they are also strange monsters too depending on who/what they were before they were infected. That\\'s what drew me to the series in the first place and it\\'s a fantastic story to see more of.All in all the only reason this isn\\'t 10/10 is that quick rush to the end. If they\\'d let the story build a bit more, have the heroes at a half way point and let this move into a season 2 I think it would be a perfect series.But aside from that, it\\'s fantastic.As always (without very few notable exceptions) the netflix dub is atrocious and I suggest watching this on original language with subs if you don\\'t speak Korean, the VA\\'s in it are terrible in English and like most things these days dubbed into English, I avoid that like the plague.,Despite the all over the place story & occasionally terrible special effects, this is yet another fab Korean series. They really have got the horror market sewn up!,One of the worst things I have ever seen. Horrible characters, annoying to the core, terrible soundtrack and special effects. This was definitely the stuff of nightmares... production nightmares. I don\\'t understand how anyone could watch more than one episode, the opening scene alone is just awful. This is just a weird show that has no real reason for existing and is all over the place. Couldn\\'t even make to episode three. Hated this, its just loud and ugly and random. Tried to sit and give it another try, nope... its not happening.,The show is actually very good oh, and goes much deeper than you would expect. Visually good and well written. Sure on the outside it looks like a monster flick but it\\'s what\\'s on the inside. Everybody has monsters living inside them screaming out. Would you like to be your monster, yes.....no. Would you kill? Can you survive?,I really enjoyed this series. The mix of horror, drama, and cinematography are well done. In regards to the cinematography, it\\'s not about great vistas and scenery. It\\'s the way the actors are filmed. The acting is very good, many of the actors are really quite good looking. While I rarely like Action or horror productions that dwell overly on human relationships, because the writing is often not very good and melodramatic. I found myself reasonably invested in the fortunes of the various characters and the group as a whole. The CGI is professional, but much of the series is not about monsters, but about people trying to survive. Threats come from different and unexpected sources, which kept me involved. I would be very happy to see a second season if they decide to produce one.,This is a pretty solid horror show and an interesting premise at that. Rather than just a straight up infection turning people into monsters, the nature of what is turning people into monsters is left intentionally vague, though it is affected by the type of person. There is a lot of human drama and issues dealing with surviving in an enclosed area with limited resources. The actors/actresses are good for the most part, though there is a disconnect where some characters are super emotive and over the top and others and barely responsive given the situation. The one thing that I thought could have been better were the effects. While I understand that it is a lower-budget show, it\\'s just that a lot of the CG, especially the monsters, felt out of place. Some of the CG looks pretty good, other CG not so much, but it just doesn\\'t really mesh well together. If all the CG was low-budget but had a more consistent art style and direction I think it would have been alot better. Still, a pretty good show.,\"Sweet Home\" is a South Korean fantasy horror directed by masterful Lee Eung Bok. This show is about a group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing, so this is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it category. Monsters are unique and extremely hard to kill with some pretty terrifying cosmetics and fairly basic CGI. The series overall is visually stunning with many disturbing scenes akin to the Evil Dead franchise. The narrative is very disjointed, difficult to follow, and not very engaging, but the show is addictive and a bloody feast to watch.,So it seems that the show kind of let down the manga fans who complain about the adaptation. Well, who cares.This was a fun, bingeworthy show with an excellent ensemble cast and more character development than in 30 episodes series. You just need a manga lens to get used to the silliness of some of the monsters, but as the show progresses we get less of that and more of human interactions.Still, a potential viewer must be warned that there\\'s no explanation why that plague has befallen Seoul (and probably the world), there\\'s no clear ending and probably no season 2. Just so you know.,I totally love South Korean films and cinematography, always technically innovative and unique. The series is visually stunning unfortunately the script is very disjointed almost difficult to follow and not very engaging. But it is a feast to watch.,With some pretty terrifying cosmetics and fairly basic CGI, it does create some disturbing scenes akin to Evil Dead. But the plot is sadly ruined by a lot of nonsensical moments actions & reactions that are clearly only there to create tension. It\\'s also oddly like every actor went to the same acting school and acquired an annoying prolonged lifeless gaze look as their reaction to basically everything.... Wondering what to have for dinner? ( Stare longingly into the fridge). Watching your neighbour get devoured by a hideous demon (stare longingly into neighbours intestines). Saving your friends from certain death by simply closing a door ( stare longingly at door handle) it\\'s relentlessly like this from start to finish.,As a Webtoon long time fan, I just had to watch this, and I can say, I am not disappointed. Characters are just amazing, great representation of human interaction in specific horrifying circumstances, lovely depiction of fight from average, normal people you could likely meet anywhere, great action, fun, there is also a lot of humor, and the story is just amazing. It has horror, sf and comedy elements, but it also has deeper meaning, much more than surface deep horror, it makes you think. There is no some superficial glamour, no model like characters, but humans you can relate to and like. Story is quite interesting and has deeper layers than it looks on first sight. Granted, CGI effects are not much, as production does not seem expensive, but I still loved it, because all CGI is in function of the story, not just to shock you.Also, soundtrack is getting great along with the story.I would recommend it, and I am waiting for second season!,Yes, I\\'ve read the comic to completion. I was thoroughly enjoying the first three episodes of the show, but then the fourth episode happened and it just kept getting worse from there, I was so put off half way through episode six that I just stopped watching and I haven\\'t gone back since.The show drops some of the character development seen in the comic books and suffers for it, the CGI is spotty, but it\\'s a show so you\\'ve got to give it a break. Overall, the shows just not that engaging, I think it\\'ll work for the 16-24 crowd, but if you\\'re outside that demo you may struggle to get over some of the rushed pacing and bland storytelling.The editor was most certainly on crack because some of the editing in this is just confused as all hell! OMG The usage of Imagine Dragons is so confusing and inappropriate to the scenes it\\'s being used for I often wondered if the music supervisor was held at gunpoint by the Imagine Dragons lead singer.I don\\'t want another season of this show, I just wish it were an anime, but here we are I guess. I Don\\'t think it\\'ll grip the audience necessary to warrant a second season. However, due to COVID more people may watch this than if everything was operating normally. I guess Netflix will play the wait and see game and let the viewership numbers dictate a renewal. Personally I hope it\\'s cancelled so they can invest in something good/original.,Awesome bit of fun, if your looking for some kinda bonkers weird horror series to do with these demon-like monsters, this would be something to check out. The characters are enjoyable, fun, and silly. The story is much in the same vain, it\\'s enjoyable, silly, fun, great horror, very reminiscent of Tokyo Gore Police. Soundtrack did make me chuckle, I wander how much \"Warriors\" by imagine dragon costed, we had a fun little bet going as to when it was going to be played. I can\\'t wait for a second season!!!,The show\\'s first few episodes were terrific. Great monsters and special effects. About midway the nihilism and the convoluted plot derail what could have been an Awesome series. The ending makes no sense and is clearly a half assed set up for a second season. Also, the MC is quite frankly a sad sack from beginning to end - so don\\'t expect any redemptive character arc. Every episode is filled with people emoting and crying constantly - which works in the first few episodes but becomes numbingly tedious as the show continues to its conclusion. The actors are all uniformly good and are given some space to really shine. However, even the character standouts are eventually left stranded by the nonsensical script. Worth watching though but don\\'t expect to leave the table satisfied.,I wish they either waited for better funding to the project or split the script in two seasons to tell the whole story. They tried to cram in the whole story along with heavy changes into 10 episodes. The problem with this is:Everyones character arc is watered down along with Cha Hyun-Su.The epic finale from the comics is reworked into some kind of military crap which is the default of every pandemic movie.The dark tone of the comic is reworked into the lines of an action movie rather than horror. Everytime something happens they spam Warriors by Imagine Dragons.Also whats up with the wierd camera cuts/jumps that happens all the time. It\\'s like they skip 5 seconds forward during action scenes and you lose track of what\\'s going on.,A good wholesome Korean horror flick that is fun for the whole family! 😁,I would give the show am 8 but it is slightly hindered by its odd musical choices and bad cgi (the practical effects are wonderfully done however). I can forgive the bad cgi since I imagine this was not the biggest budget show, however the odd sometimes inane musical choices really throw the feeling off and sound design (which encompasses music)is essential in film and television.,Stick with it. Great acting, great story line, amazing monstars and soundtrack!,It was hard to continue to watch till the end while plot\\'s joints and man\\'s operations are typically stupid.It looks many that reactions & acting s are too fake to the incidents.Graphic is good. Ost is good. But it\\'s very unfortunate they made it as inadequate finally because of plot\\'s arrangement, fake or overplayed actings & some unnecessary slow scenes.Plus, really didn\\'t like main actress choice. It would be better if different actress are played. She shows some retarded acting like trynna being cool. She really doesn\\'t fit in. Sorry.The only reason watched till the end is didn\\'t want to make a deficient conclusion without watching.,I really like the monsters in this show, they are weird, creepy and very creative. The story line really pulled me in and keeps me watching as well. I just wish the characters weren\\'t so one dimensional and the acting wasn\\'t a bit cheesey. I think they overdid the cliche stoicism too. And the guy with the sword makes me cringe sometimes lol. But overall it\\'s a dent show to binge on.,Read and listen.... I can understand people who freaked out in the first 3 episodes, bad cg, cut scenes, blah blah. After the first 3 episodes it gets better. It\\'s different and fresh. It gets better and better when all the characters develop. I understand it, I get it. Bypass the mediocre graphics and understand the overall tv show. It\\'s brilliant, it\\'s different. I do like all the characters, and I love the acting, they have some of my favorite supporting characters in other Korean shows. It develops and it changes. It\\'s not your typically survive from monsters tv show, it brings a different element to it. I really hope it has a second season and this is higher than a 7.5 in my opinion. I think it has potential to 7.8-8.3 overall. Each character have their own story and there is more story to come. I wish people would leave reviews after watching a few episodes instead of jumping to conclusion. I agree, I did not like it at first and I thought about it like a dark comedy but it develop into something serious, especially when you like all the characters. People, please, chill out and give it a try. Support new ideas instead of bashing on it with weak reviews. I think it\\'s a 8.3 but I\\'ll rate it a 10 to help with the ratings because it will turn away people, it\\'s not bad of a tv show as how some people made it to be. I already binged 9 episodes in 2 days. Good stuff, chill out please.,So the premise is interesting. It has the look of a manga if you like that sort of thing and some moments are really cool. However the story is all over the place, so I agree with everyone who says it starts well but gets boring because of slow pacing and disjointed story telling. It\\'s hard to follow also cause the characters all look the same and the korean names dont help, everyone is like Jun Jin Jon, Kwon bun bam, cin ciun lan, who the hell remembers that. And yes the CGI is that of a low budget straight to dvd movie, but if they paid a bit more attention to crafting a better structured story I would have excused it. In the end disappointing.,With netflix\\'s budget its shocking to see bad the CGI is, maybe they were inspired by sharknado. editing is pretty weak, u often get confused by its unnecessary random timeline jumping. playback at 1.5x speed & its still kinda slow. overall quite entertaining & has its touching moments.,Nothing I can say, its just Excellent!\\r\\nFirst the Kingdom and this Sweet Home! I have another reason to subscribe at netflix hhaha,Just finished episode 5 and I don\\'t know whether to continue, how this show is even getting at least 6 star rating from some people surprises me or does it get better after episode 6?\\r\\nthe plot line is such a bore and the monsters! my God the monsters are so awful, who ever designed them is such an idiot, none of the monsters make sense to me! then there\\'s the action scenes where its like it\\'s skipping, pathetic! you barely know what happened and too many characters to keep up with, it\\'s like every episode has a new character introduced. so much cringe in this show.\\r\\nI would rather watch romance kdrama than this bore fest and that says a lot,Just brilliant, great filming, good characters, old fashioned monsters. Definitely worth a watch.,I wonder if the people who rated this poorly gave up too early. I was one of them, I gave it 5 stars and moved on. But something about it was intriguing, so I came back. Ep 1 was promising, then it went downhill, I dropped it after Ep 3, but when I came back and I didn\\'t regret it. I\\'m now rating it with a solid 8. The characters were annoying, yes, but they grew on me. Many dialogues and reactions seemed rather stupid, but they leaded to some great scenes. This series has a nice atmosphere, beautiful actors with lots of charisma. I liked the soundtrack and the CGI (yes, I do!). My biggest issue was the storytelling. They told too many stories at the same time. You want to know what happens to a certain character, but you have to wait, because other stories get in the way. I would have preferred it, if they finished one story arc and then moved on. I wasn\\'t bothered by this kind of storytelling that much later on, when the series progressed. Most likely because the characters grew on me, and I was equally invested in everyone of them. To make it short: interesting survival/zombie/monster plot with annoying characters who became less annoying the more you know about them, decent CGI, decent music, some very good coloring and atmosphere. Some very good directing, some very bad directing and yeah ... Could have been better, but they did a good job most of the time. Some scenes were really bad, some were brilliant. Sometimes the action was incredible, sometimes it looked cheap or they just skipped a scene so you didn\\'t even know what happened. It is, what it is. And it was a nice watch and an emotional ride.,Got something a about it. Shame the budget, is around 10p. Annoying characters, weird decisions. Nothing really makes any sense. But for some reason I kept watching. I guess hoping it would get better.,I\\'m 5 episodes in, I started watching last night and I\\'m hooked. The story is basically people are turning into random monsters and follow a group of survivors in a apartment building. I would say it falls under horror but there is some light humour thrown in as well. There is good deal of drama in the mix, a couple of times I did actually cry something I don\\'t do often. It is very well acted the story is great so far and there is a good balance of action and character building. I recommend watching with the original Korean voice with English subtitles, I tried to watch it with English voice overs but it just wasn\\'t as good. The one negative i have is on the most part the effects are good but the CGI is great in places and then terrible in others. But I can\\'t recommend this enough, Especially if you like horror.,The episode Im currently watching is full of asian steriotypes roles and catch phrases. Storyline... welll will see If one will apear. it feels like more like a computer game, but most computer games have a deeper story... Up to now not impressed...,This series is amazing... Needs season 2...\\r\\nThis is just a different type of horror show. There are know comparisons.\\r\\nI\\'m in the UK... It was dubbed but the dubbing was done so well I actually forgot it was dubbed.. Worth a watch right to the end..,An entertainment masterpiece. From the acting, to the special effects. Don\\'t miss this amazing show. It\\'s a gem.,4/10 for the horrible cgi monsters which brings the whole drama down, esp since the show is based on these monsters. Oh ya, the building is also a horrible cgi.it was made in 2020, and this is the cgi? ugh!\\r\\nHm what else? let\\'s see, the plot is alright so far. I was scared a lot. It has a quite few heart stopping moments.\\r\\nHowever, I\\'m already seeing some of the korean specific trope, namely, the mother whose daughter is outside and wants to open the gate. I just hated how the other characters didn\\'t let her go the 2nd time. Like hey man, personal choice/decision, the mother has a functional mind; she can consent. She wants to go outside and die? Let her try and die. Stop keeping her and endanger the rest of group. Alright, the first time I understood why they couldn\\'t open the door. Heck, even I wouldn\\'t let her. I\\'d fight her tooth and nails and override her reckless decision to endanger not only herself, but others too. But bish when she did it again secretly and opened the freakin door, it\\'s time to cut some losses and kick her out of the door. She wants to go that badly to save her daughter? LET. HER. The door was open and they held her back???( I could see that plotline a mile away because THIS is KDRAMA. This is train to busan all over again when the grandma opened the door. ) I can\\'t believe they had literally noone to keep an eye on her after her 1st attempt. Who\\'s stupid enough to let her off completely without 2nd thought? Oh another thing, the bish was not punished for her action. Instead, they had characters be like \"oh, no her daughter\\'s dead.\" Ya, well, what about the solider who died unnecessarily trying to save her? (ya, they don\\'t talk about it.) Tbh, they should have the mother try to rescue her daughter to give her some closure. and wth was her daughter doing outside anyway with all those mosnters? how did she make it that far? makes no sense.\\r\\noh last thing, i hate seeing that actor in the wheelchair. he\\'s everywhereeeeeeeee. i\\'m tired so seeing the same face again and again.,Acting is very bad. A bunch of people staring at others or at nothing, vacantly, for too long. Conversations are stupid. Reactions are even more stupid or non-existent. The first episode is probably the best since it has interesting u-turns, but it fast goes downhill from there. Monsters are very badly made later on, to the point that it\\'s embarassing to watch. I\\'ve stopped watching after second episode. Go and watch Alice in Wonderland instead.,It\\'s Korean. So you kind of know what your going to be getting when it comes to the main characters. You always have the \"comedy rolls\" and there is no exception here. I can find these characters annoying, but in Sweet Home, there is definitely enough crazy monster stuff going on to take your mind of them.\\r\\nThis is not perfect but very enjoyable. The story does start to fade to the end, maybe two episode to long.,I like this so much. i just want to protect hyun su at all cost... i love all the characters and it was so sad when they were gone one by one. the whole turning into a monster things is a bit confusing but it\\'s also interesting how one would turn into something they desire the most... i can\\'t wait for the season 2!!,Although full of ridiculous creatures like Hulk ultra pro max, sticky Chewbacca, snakey tongue and a skinny guy with half his head cut off- it has a good message. It\\'s about survival. And it has 2 cute guys, I personally love Lee Jinwook.,I really enjoyed Sweet Home. It\\'s an urban disaster series which you\\'ll think is initially going to be zombie-esque, but the producers take zombie apocalypses to a new level with a monster brand. It\\'s frightening, funny and there\\'s never a dull moment.,What a fantastic show. It made me realize that Hollywood stopped making monster movies long time ago... it\\'s all zombies, vampires and ghosts and nothing else now. This was so refreshing. I binged on it for a few nights.What was even more refreshing is the Korean cast... it was so nice to take a break from American \"culture\" and actually see good people, just plain simple, good, nice, all likeable people without typical annoying American \"baggage\". Nobody in this show was annoying. It was like taking a breath of clean mountain air.Very original, great atmosphere, great characters, great cinematography, great pace, great action, dialogue, I have nothing to complain about at all... it was much more enjoyable than anything Hollywood made in recent years.I will definitely be looking for more Korean movies/TV shows now.,Someone wrote, don\\'t give up after the first episode. I feel exactly the opposite, the first 3-4 episodes were excellent. After that it became more soap opera with every episode. Probably Koreans will say this is not that Korean, that it is a westernized version. I\\'m Hungarian so viewing this series it seemed very Asian to me. The interaction, the greetings, the politeness and manner, relationships between characters are very Asian. For example the relationship between the guy with the sword and the bass player girl (I\\'m sorry but the names were really difficult to me to know) is just a platonic love and then the guy dies. In a western film there would have been at least kissing but more likely sex. Or the long takes on the meaningful gazes of the characters.In the first couple episodes the monsters are excellent, but around the 7-8 th episode it dies down the story becomes more drama driven. The music was mixed, it tried to have classical and modern pieces alike. They seem to have bought the Warriors Imagine Dragons song (which I\\'m sure was pretty expensive) so they overplayed it.\\r\\nYeah I get it, the real monsters are the humans losing their humanity in this series, but that took away the horror part too fast.There are some illogical parts or plot holes like monsters don\\'t die. But the first one (the women that wants to kill Hyun-Su) dies directly after being her faced kicked into pulp and after that several monsters are killed of.Overall a really good experience and it kept me watching but to be honest it was getting more predictable and flat nearing the end.,The whole series feels pretty much as a generic B category zombie thingy and then... I do not know when but it turned out to be one of the best series in the genre.,A single question between the lines.Effective.And please, Kim Kap-Su, enormous !,The show is \"ok\" but not on the level of Squid Game or Hellbound. Some interesting characters, some not, some good scenes and parts of a good story but it just drags way to far long. This should have been a ~6 episode season. I think it just tried too hard in the middle to try and be cleaver but just never reached that point. They could have cut so much junk out and done a much better job in far less episodes.,I really liked this new take on Zombie films. To link the metamorphosis to a monster with trauma in the past is a great image of depression and trauma in the real world. Really great. I wished they would have done a little more with that. Unfortunately they had some silly decision-making, a lot of tell-don\\'t show and sometimes a little over-the-top acting. Also some of the deaths (in some cases they might come back) of characters were just unnecessary and not logical at all. Also when the gang showed up they were a way over-the-top evil as well. I would rather liked to have seen more of trauma and how monsters are the image of everybody dealing with this. But I complain too much. It is well shot and acted most of the time, there is a good score and the CGI is mostly well, sometimes a little cheap, but it is a TV-show. It does not bother me. Also the kid actors were good as far as I can tell, not being a native speaker. What is sometimes bothering me a little bit is the rules of this world. Apparently you cannot kill the monsters but they still attack them with fire and so on. Why? They should rather trap them somewhere or something. People don\\'t have to die fighting a thing they can\\'t kill (the elevator-fire scene). But as I said, overall a good watch. Let\\'s hope there is more of psychology and less of bang-bang kill (probably not).,I\\'m so confused why this isn\\'t t rated higher this drama was really good I enjoyed every moment.. sometimes ratings don\\'t actually don\\'t reflect well on a show or people don\\'t go further than episode one then rate it low but this is definitely one you should watch I loved it.. definitely a 10/10 for me.,Inventive twists every time you turn around! Dialogue (dubbed) is a little strained, but, hey, it\\'s Korean. Lots of blood and gore, and they are reincarnating monsters instead of zombies. A few characters transition back and forth, making one constantly guess about loyalties and potential betrayals.Currently finished episode three and eager for more.,Aswell as great Monsters, makes this a Netflix Korean Hit not to be missed.The ending was a tad confusing, however I am sure I get it.\\r\\nThe only real critism I have is That the writers literally killed off every amazing character, which I was kinda bummed about.\\r\\nI will also say, if you like the other Korean TV show \"Kingdom\" You will love this.\\r\\n8/10 Can\\'t wait for S02,Too many gimmicks. Movie is not serious. See zombie still can joke around. Waste time.,Thats right, the only enjoyable way to watch this is, by keep endlessly pressing the forward button towards the key points in the movie.,This is one of those shows that you watch the first episode of and don\\'t feel a connection to it, but with patience it could become your favorite Netflix Original. You will fall in LOVE with the cast and the extremely original story. I would literally pay money to witness this again for the first time.,Im sure it looses something in translation, but the acting in this is horrible.,I found the concept brilliant. Many monsters of all sizes and shapes with different abilities. I also loved the characters or loved to hate some of them. My only problem was that around the middle the story became slower. There were some interesting background stories which made up for it, but still, I think maybe some more monsters could have appeared in order to fill the space. I didn\\'t like that some scenes were just cut off. For example: two characters were struggling with a monster, one of them was willing to sacrifice himself (if necessary), so the other character could go and help the others. The camera goes with the 2nd guy and the other one is left alone with the monster. The 2nd guy then does, what he has to do and later on the first guy joins the group. As if nothing had happened before. I would have expected to see some details about how he managed to get away and get rid of the monster he was fighting against. I have the same problem with the end. The main character gets shot at and he is badly injured, then all of the sudden he is in a back of a car. I would have liked to see how he managed to get into the car. Despite of these it was a refreshing little tale and hope to get a second season - with a plenty more monsters.,It\\'s well worth watching, it\\'s a good show, as expected from korean horror cinematography the characters are charismatic and the show is exciting and addictive, and full of emotion, but don\\'t expect the storyline to make much sense. It\\'s the kind of show you\\'ll shout to the screen expecting characters to be smarter; but they won\\'t.I hope there\\'s gonna be a second season, there\\'s still many questions with no answer, but for the looks of it this may be it; and that\\'s fine.,CGI is garbage, story is all over the place, choppy editing and the characters are either annoying or moronic. How this series is getting more than a 5 rating is beyond me,In a word - EPIC! And yes, watch it to the end. Can\\'t wait for Season 2...,A mix of terribly bad CGI, good special effects and bad special effects and a story line that makes zero sense. I managed to work myself through a few episodes but still have absolutely no clue what it\\'s about.I don\\'t understand the many good reviews... What am I missing?,Stay for the story and be wowed by the visuals along the way. Incredible art design.,I love monster stuff. I love doomsday stuff. I just love this gory, entertaining, eye candy of a show. Can\\'t wait for more!,It\\'s real good. If it was an anime it would\\'ve gotten an 8.5 rating. Everything about it screams anime, even the way the characters look, it\\'s a solid story line, with great SFX. Give it a chance it may just grow on you.,I was so disappointed with an episode 7 everything was so good and great until It added the bad cgi and random monster battle\\'s and what not the acting was good atmosphere is amazing like the costuming and the placement is perfect and stirring the I read this before I watched this on Netflix but the CGI oh my God so bad.,This show is utterly fantastic. The evolution of the characters over the course of 10 episodes is done subtly but in a manner you grasp by the time you\\'re done. This series is so much more than what you would expect and puts other shows of the same genre to shame. You\\'ll run the full gambit of emotions and be left wanting more. 10 out of 10 and truly hoping for a season 2.,BEST SHOW EVER ON NETFLIX!!!!!! THE FIRST FEW EPISODES WERE SLOW BUT I CONTINUED WATCHING TILL THE END. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WAS AWESOME. THIS SHOW WAS INTENSE !!! I\\'M A GROWN MAN AND I CRIED AT LEAST 7 TIMES!!!!!! PLEASE WATCH TO THE END !!!!,Extraordinary! you must watch this! but I remind you, the ending is very hanging. But it\\'s okay, Netflix has confirmed it will produce season 2 and I think it will be fantastic,There is a lot to like though, acting is mostly on point, where it wasn\\'t was scenes where a character was lil over the top in complaining. Story is very intriguing and I would definitely like to see where it goes after season 1. CGI hit and miss some of it was so realistic then at other times or different part of the CGI effect it would seem like stop motion style and or janky animations. But good enough to propel the story.,Another Netflix show where dispite the dire and apocaliptical settings the characters find themselves in, they still retain awesome haircuts and great clothing! This aproach speaks volumes of the show already!\\r\\nThis serie is entertaining, it manages to create some tension and despite being cartoony, you can relate with the charaters tribulations. It has a fairly good cinematography and despite the budget, they have created some elements that work well. That said, if you´ve come because of the featuring monsters, this is for you. The rest is just kind of bad. For the plot and the story itself are nothing more than junior soap opera filled with clichés and basically more of the same. By now we have seen these kind of dilemas a million times over, and they make no effort to put a spin on this take. If you don´t mind the setting, like some monster flicks, you could do worse than this.,I used to like abnormal activities and creations , this series has the weirdest idea I\\'ve ever watch , good one.,Sweet Home South Korean Fantasy Horror Drama Directed by one of the best kdrama directors in history Lee Eung Bok person who directed Mr.Sunshine, Goblin, and Descendants of the sun. This is a popular webtoon adaptation by Netflix. First do not compare with Kingdom series. This show is the most expensive Netflix show made in South Korea so I had high expectations but after watching the trailer I was kinda disappointed. CGI monsters look likes garbage to me, yes in this series they look like PlayStation 2 game. That\\'s the biggest weakens in this series. When it comes to practical effects they have done a great job. Sweet Home reminds me of Resident Evil and Train to Busan. The plot is good but there are few plot holes. This is not just another zombie drama because these monsters are not easy to kill and every each monster is very unique that\\'s one of the main reasons for me to keep watch this series. I loved the cinematography and color grading. There are a lot of close-up shots. It reminds me of the dexter intro which is really awesome. This is the most aggressive kdrama I have ever watched, there is a lot of violence and blood. They have a top-notch cast for this series and there not going to disappoint you. Every character in this series felt real to me. there are a lot of character developments throughout the series. There were a few characters that I need a backstory for them. The soundtracks are good but there was imagine dragons song and I felt that is not necessary for the scenes. Overall this is a good show with a lot of entertainment and I hope they develop their CGI in the next seasons.,(a spoiler for TWD S07 if you haven\\'t watched it yet)\\r\\nIt felt more like when Negan entered on the screen and ripped Abraham\\'s head with Lucille,I\\'ve tried very hard to like this series telling myself that the next episode will be better. However, I am just disappointed !. There\\'s no character development and emotional connection to the characters and within the characters involved. Bland ...Just Bland!!. I hope the next season will get better \\'fingers crossed\\',At first I wasn\\'t even planning on watching this because of course netflix would ruin it, I was dead wrong. This is one of the best \"netflix originals\" full stop. Blows every live action adaptation they\\'ve made of ANYTHING out the water so far you can see it from space. Does the source material an amazing justice and really brings to light just how bad that apartment complex looked to live in. Not a single bad casting call, even the normally awful CG looks great. Even when the cg is \"bad\" it still fits the tone of what the monsters are supposed to be. Could not have asked for a better job to have been done.,I can believe I am really really liking this show. It is overdone in a good way. Not too much, just right. I really like what they\\'re doing. A real comment on modern Korean society- people being left behind because they don\\'t happen to match up to some spectacular expectations. Here we have a group of failures and real bad people....battling their monsters.,Mmmm better ver of TG with clear background?... I hate it when the sudden cut happen... Somehow feel like missing something... Overall its good,The show has a fast, intriguing and impressive opening that really hooks you.And don\\'t get me wrong, the rest of the episodes are decent but they drift off. It never really regains the flair and interest it starts with.Absolutely worth watching, and it manages to stay watchable all the way through.Just don\\'t expect it to keep up the pace.,Okay, this is the Deal, if you have watched Train to Busan, that zombie movie...well this one makes that Train ride, look like Cinderella. The story is intense, the pace like a rollercoaster ride in hell, the blood and gore by the buckets, the photography equals anything Hollywood has shown, even better, the fx is so good. Yes I\\'m gushing shamefully, but let me tell you, you are in the right place if you like thrillers, edge of your seat movies, you feel like pissing stuff. Not going to ruin your fun, no Spoiler. Go check this out. thank me later...lol,First of all, I want to say, both the \"perfect\" reviews and the \"abysmal\" reviews both miss the mark. This show is a great \"middle-of-the-road\" experience. It\\'s concepts are great, and in the same breath, the writing is terrible in a way that is really entertaining to tease poking fun. The effects are awesome while the characters are hilariously aching anime/manga clichés. Great emotion with wafer-thin development, and so on and so forth. I would recommend you check it out, but go in with an attitude that this isn\\'t one of those Netflix masterpiece offerings or absolute trash despite how much people want it to be one or the other.,Felt like watching someone playing a bad videogame. One of the worst things in Netflix. If this came out from Hollywood , nobody would have bother about reviewing it.,Horrendous scrip drags sometimes boring what a waste of talent,Thought I give it a shot and ended up binding the whole first season.,Can I swear? If so this series is @u&k<*% brilliant.I\\'ve not been hooked this bad in such a long time. Literally sitting on edge of my seat upright totally tranced.I really don\\'t wanna go into too much detail to ruin any aspect of this. So heed my words and watch this watch it now!,It\\'s really good and the background score made it even more interesting,Netflix is getting very ignorant in entertainment. There are just some movies or TV shows that are not worth it in anyway shape or form. Rather it come from acting directing the writing the casting department and people who look for screens. When it comes to the art of storytelling and then transferring the storytelling into English for American movie watchers/television series show watchers. Everything should honestly makes sense. Nothing in this show makes sense from start to beginning to the roles that people are playing in the show the stupidest characters with in the show are the females and their responses to everything. If this is the way people conduct themselves in Korea is a situation like this was to occur. Then the show should\\'ve just ended with a nuclear bomb being dropped on Korea. I\\'ve never seen failure and entertainment on such a grand scale.,I haven\\'t seen the webtoon so can\\'t compare them but I liked it a lot. Cool monsters, nice acting ( I cared for many characters), interesting story. What do you except more? It\\'s all about monsters. You know what you going to watch, so if you like action, monsters, adrenaline go for it!!!\\r\\nCan\\'t wait for season 2,This is one of those films that takes awhile to warm up.... but when it does, it\\'s actually thoroughly entertaining.There were a few plot holes here and there, but it is easy to forgive those when compared to how RIVETING it was to experience such a bizarre post-apocalyptic world. Most of the time I was completely engrossed in the storytelling..... and though the ending threw me off a little.... I definitely do not regret watching it. I gave it 8/10 because it is one of the better horror/fantasy films that I have seen in awhile.,I tried so hard to like this one and for the first few episodes I was enjoying it for the most part as the story showed promise but I just couldn\\'t relate to a single character. They are mostly emotionless and just have zero sympathy for anything. It\\'s kinda awkward to watch and extremely frustrating at times. The monsters were pretty cool and they\\'re all I really stayed for in the end but they\\'re appearances were way too far and few between. I personnal got on and am getting on a lot better with Squid Game (finished) and Alice in Borderland (1 episode in),Not ussualy into korean tv series but it has diffrent horror/fantasy vibe, acting is on point, there are a variety of characters with diffrent stories so they probably need more time to develop, very interesting post apocalyptic series, it has zombiesh look but its much more then that,At first, I put \"Sweet Home\" away twice, me it\\'s hard to watch, but it\\'s worth it, a story not about monsters at all it\\'s only about humans, hope to authors keep on season 2,The monsters were so distracting. They were so over the top that it was hard to focus on the plot. Plot was predictable. However, it was still a fun watch.,Both in story and acting, this series is superb. One moment you are holding your breath as the action explodes, then there\\'s an unmoveable lump in your throat as one or more of the beautiful characters as killed, then, without warning, you are smiling or even laughing!Visual effects are second to none, every actor is top class and the plot is a mindtwister! If this is not renewed for at least a second season, then may all at Netflix suffer the fate of Ms An!,I watched this on Netflix with subtitles and the original dialogue. I can\\'t comment on dubbing other than don\\'t use it for anything, ever.It\\'s an interesting take on the zombie/monster genre. But if you get interested by the first few episodes you might later regret feeling the need to stick through and see how it ends. By the last few episodes I was losing interest. Several characters are intolerable. Some likable characters are sidelined. Some events are over the top to the point that it\\'s frustrating. It sometimes goes too far on pointless shock value, and other times not far enough. It\\'s not a terrible show if you\\'re looking for monster/horror/apocalypse/survival, but I found it getting old by the end.,Man, this show was something, I definitely recommend it to every horror fan out there. It\\'s a fresh take on the tired zombie-siege formula with a great set of characters, great performances ans most importantly fantastic monster designs used in creative set-pieces.If I would have rated this after the first 3 episodes, this would have been an easy 9, unfortunately the show can\\'t keep the pace and sharp writing of it\\'s opening up and deflates to an extend. The best monsters and set-pieces are delivered up-front, while we are getting more character focuses later on. This by itself wouldn\\'t have been bad, since the human stories are good ones and the investment in the peoples fates is definitely there, but the show really struggles to move the plot along after things settle. The writers really struggle to give people something to do and random side quests pop-up that are almost immediately dropped after an anti-climatic resolution. There is also a weird editing structure at place I never got used to, where the show would give us flashbacks to past conversations or basically extended versions of prior scenes where something was said or done, that only becomes immediately relevant after the flashback. There seems to be no faith in the audience to keep track of character motivations and relationships over multiple episodes.\\r\\nAlso rules are very inconsistent, first it\\'s a big deal that monsters can\\'t be killed, plenty of monsters are killed. Wearing headphones should alert you to monsters presence, people with headphones get jumped by monsters all the time and so on...Lastly, it becomes a pity party quite often, I was worried the besieged apartment building would sink in the lake of tears generated by the people trapped inside. It is standard for Asian cinema, but still a bit too much some times.That sound overly negative, but make no mistakes, the show is good overall, you come for the monsters, you stay for the survivors. The creature design is great throughout, the CGI holds up most of the time (whit a couple of bad shots, mainly involving a hulking monstrosity) and the practical effects are top notch like the overall production value. If we get a second season I hope the overall plot is paced much better and the emotions will be dialed back a bit,I settle back to watch a Korean webtoon based apocalyptic horror TV series (released on Netflix on December 18, 2020) and confusedly hear the lead in score of \"Dies irae\" (which is something like a 17th century Latin based Requiem Mass). Not a Korean score - oh wait... it is... arranged by Cho Yoon Jung? So, this is why I watch foreign films. It broadens my perspective.I have low expectations in regard to this particular genre - but, I am pleasantly surprised, entertained and impressed.There is some very good acting in some well written and directed roles. For example, Lee Do-hyun as Lee Eun-hyuk the accepted leader of a building\\'s survivors.\\r\\nAnother example, Lee Si-young as Seo Yi-kyung, a former firefighter.\\r\\nI could list a dozen more.A problem are the character roles thrown in for comedic relief which are horribly conceived and delivered. If those roles had been rewritten as dramatic roles the series would have been better. The child roles were atrocious. For some reason the children typically shouted their dialogue.I think I am not familiar with Korean culture and perhaps I do not understand the acting. For example, when the characters would do a hysterical sequence it always came across as whiny-screaming (I listened with Korean audio and English subtitles). Perhaps that is how individuals act hysterically in Korea? Maybe I should listen to the English actors dub and see if that comes across better for an American?Regardless, the series is surprisingly entertaining and I think individuals who enjoy this genre will enjoy Sweet Home.,I couldn\\'t get into this show until the second episode, and the CGI is awful. However, starting with the second episode, this show becomes quite gripping. There is a particularly horrific scene in which a child is killed in front of her mother. The actress who plays the mother of the child deserves an award for her amazing performance. Part of what makes this show riveting is that it\\'s not afraid to put characters who are children in peril and the show makes you genuinely afraid that a child could be killed. Also, it\\'s refreshing that the evil creatures are monsters for a change instead of zombies. However, I have to deduct a point for a boring first episode and another point for awful CGI.,I was so impressed with the first couple of episodes!\\r\\nDidn\\'t expect anything and loved the wierd, quirky residents of the building. And then the monster came - and man are they awesome!! Totally could see it as a video game ala Resident Evil or Silent Hill.\\r\\nBUT around half way through it felt like they had fired all their good shots - less monsters, and mainly people sitting around /talking /crying or fighting each other. (maybe they were out of budget?!)\\r\\n10* for the first half and 5-6* for the second.All together still very watchable,The acting and special effects are great, top notch,I would rate this lower, but it was at least a fun show to watch. Sweet Home is a Netflix series based on the famous Webtoon \\'Sweet Home\\'. Now I haven\\'t finished reading the Webtoon, but from what I have read it is much better than this. From the same creator as \\'Bastard\\', one of my favourite Web series, it\\'s hard to see his work being vandalised with this \"bastardised\" live adaptation.Now it isn\\'t all bad, the show is at least fun and creative. The start of the show was good for the most part, but already from the start the monsters looked a bit silly, and the acting was oddly overdone. Then we start to see a bit of divergence in storytelling compared to its source material; while not always a bad thing, with The Shining being one of my favourite movies - which diverged so much from the book, this is another good example of \"if it isn\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\". The show introduces monsters with barely any explanation of their backstories or the reason they are the way they are. This is annoying as the manhwa clearly illustrates each character and monster and their purpose and reasoning for existing. This gets you invested and explains the weirdness of what\\'s going on. While they do this with some monsters, some of the weirder ones like the charger from \"Left4Dead 2\" who always says \"protein\" or the Usain Bolt zombie having 0 explanation coke across as the dumbest designs in the whole show, despite being the most intensely interesting ones in the book.It doesn\\'t help not explaining things, but it gets worse with how disjointed scenes are. I genuinely felt like I was accidentally skipping episodes with how shitty the overall pacing, where you have one character being chased down being spliced next to him being safe. It leaves me more confused than I need to be. What\\'s worse is that they also fill in the rushed pacing with blank stares and drawn out scenes that in the manhwa existed for a page usually. There are some key moments in the book that were handled so well because of the tension created, but in the Netflix adaptation scenes would be spliced with non-essential scenes that would completely break up the flow and tension.The overall feeling of emptiness, tension, sadness, horror that was created by the book is completely ruined by the over-dramatic acting and the poorly slapped on \"Imagine Dragons Warriors\" song that wouldn\\'t stop playing. With scenes dragged out, dumb looking monsters, disjointed script writing, and what felt like a completely different story being screwed onto the ending, I can\\'t see why you\\'d want to waste your time with this. It\\'s fun, but in the mindless-bed-ridden-mood kinda way.,I wanted to watch something to keep me entertained, and this definitely kept me entertained. I finished all 10 episodes in two days. Some people will nitpick every little flaws but I loved the characters, the action and the special effects. If you\\'re into long drawn out storyline with character development, just stick with the walking dead, but if you\\'re into a good apocalyptic action shows/movies, then this may be for you. You may also want to check out \"Kingdom\" (Korean zombie action drama). Very good!\\r\\nI\\'m really hoping for a second season to \"Sweet Home\"!,I\\'ll start off by saying that I\\'d never even heard of the source material going into this show, so everything I say is based strictly on the 10 episodes released thus far. In a nutshell, Sweet Home is best enjoyed with your brain turned half way between off and on.I\\'ll start off with the positives1) I was never bored while watching Sweet Home - I feel like this is a show about moments than an complex story. First and foremost, a show needs to be entertaining, and the writers, and performers, did a good enough job of keeping me entertained and interested from episode to episode.2) Some of the monster designs were spectacular - I love nothing more than seeing practical effects and make-up bring monsters to life. While some of the monsters suffer from terrible CGI being used to bring them to life, some of the designs really stood out as something else.3) There are some moments of genuine emotion - In the earlier episodes, there were some moments that legitimately had me feeling sympathy for the characters, which is incredibly important for making me care about them.Now for the negatives1) Incredibly confusing scene to scene editing - there are scenes in Sweet Home that were literally seconds apart that had me asking myself \"did I black out for a few minutes or something?\". With out spoiling things, characters go from having a conversation in one scene, to on the verge of death from a medical complication in the very next scene. In another scene a character is fighting a monster, the focus shifts to another scene, and that same character just shows up later, no explanation of how they escaped their situation. In some episodes it literally feels like there are scenes missing.2) Bewildering musical choices -The original score is really solid, and fits well (overall) with the show. However, they must have paid through the nose for that Imagine Dragons song, because it gets used a lot. There was even a very emotional scene that was ruined because they slapped this song over the scene for seemingly no reason.3) Seemingly random character deaths - Again, I haven\\'t read the source material, but I can\\'t imagine some of the characters died the same way as they did in the show. I understand that, realistically, people would seemingly die at random in a situation like this, but it doesn\\'t make for the best story. Typically in a story, a major character is killed at the end of their arc or to build emotion/hatred towards a villain. There were two pretty quick major character deaths in the show that left me more baffled than angry at the person who killed them. If I\\'m left confused and underwhelmed by a major character death, then you\\'ve more or less killed them off for nothing.4)Chekhov\\'s gun... or monster - without spoilers, there is a monster that appears to be unique because it acts differently from the other monsters that are simply filled with the urge to kill without reason. In fact this monster goes out of its way to help a character. However the reasons for this monster\\'s difference were left unexplored. It sort of left me feeling like the rule of Chekhov\\'s gun had been broken. If you\\'re not going to explore something unique you\\'ve introduced, just leave it out altogether.5) Terrible pacing, in general - I feel like this was due to the writers wanting to reach a certain point of the source material by the 10th episode, while still fitting as many of the scenes and moments from the source material in as possible. I think they would have been better off either taking things a little more slowly, or leaving some parts out. Nothing kills a story faster than bad pacing, and this show has some of the worse I\\'ve ever seen.To sum up, despite my negative sounding review, I actually really enjoyed watching Sweet Home (when I didn\\'t think too much about it), and I might even give it a second watch down the line. I\\'m interested to see if, and how, the story continues - they clearly left some cliffhangers in there. I\\'d really like to see what to world of Sweet Home is like outside of that one apartment building.,Yeah, GJ to our Korean movie-makers. Effects & montage are fine, horror component is a fact, with proper thriller and stuff. I know you \\'re most likely gonna\\' like the series, especially if you like the horror, thriller & action genre. Tbh, it wasn\\'t exactly in my type of movies. WIth this I mean, I really \\'d feel better if there was more monster action as the drama, the interpersonal relationships, crimi, etc aren\\'t among the things that provoke interest in me, but, well, different people, different points of view. You can check out the series on Netflix, and if you like the first 2-3 episodes, then you\\'d like the rest, too. You will partial find similarity to the Gantz movies, the feeling can be somewhat close, but I guess this is just Asian style, and it feels good. I hope there \\'ll be season two on Netflix to check out.,I\\'m big fan of zombie/disaster type, loved the Kingdom. Sweet home is walking dead against monsters instead of zombies. Everything is taking place inside an old apartment building. Feels like character development, relationship building is about 70% of the show, 30% being fighting monsters.Pros:\\r\\n1. Top notch production value, acting, lighting, cinematics, music.\\r\\n2. Distinct main characters\\r\\n3. Decent story\\r\\n4. Very interesting creature design, good variety in that you never know what monstrocity an \"infected\" person will turn into.Cons:\\r\\n1. Main character\\'s go to response for a question or statement being a stunned, silent stare, lasting 10, 15 seconds at times.\\r\\n2. People are way too emotional than they ought to be, and crying too much. Scenes get dragged out, trying too hard to elicit an emotional response.\\r\\n3. Monster threat level could be cranked up a few notches. I was more worried at a later point in time when our group of survivor is facing a different type of threat. Much more unpredictable and way more damaging than the monsters.,The Kingdom still is the golden standard of Netflix K-Drama if you are interested in Netflix Korean shows. That said, I only watched a few Korean movies, the Kingdom, and this show. Other Korean shows on Netflix didn\\'t quite catch my fancy yet so I stick with what I said about the Kingdom. Korean movies are generally good or excellent.So about this show:\\r\\nA few good/excellent early episode, but it turns into a mashed potato.\\r\\nSome CG works are hokey, but creatures and special effects in the show are generally good or great.It follows the Shonen Japanese anime/manage trope. I am guessing the webtoon follows the similar formula.Music choice is really regrettable as well. Warrior, I think, is the song that you will hate after 2~3 episodes. BEWHY song is good and I wish the show just featured the Korean talents.Possible Spoiler:\\r\\nOne last thing. This show also features the annoying teenager and children trope that seem to show up a lot in Asian shows. It\\'s not as bad as the infamous child character(s) from some of those old Kaiju movies.,Good story, characters well built, actors with great performance, interesting subplots. Only thing left to say is that last episode was really fast but finish all the loose ends.,The visuals of this movie are fantastic and the story is alright as well. However, there is so much drama, I almost laughed one time because of it. It feels like 60% to 70% of the time people are mourning and/or crying and it just takes a way the horror feel you want to have. I do think that the idea of making a horror more emotional is good concept in itself, but this is way way way too much. I had a hard time finishing the series because of it, but the fact that it still made me want to finish reflects in my 7/10 rating.,Bad cgi, bad acting, bad directing, at first I thought it is comedy,The initial setup of the show is quite great. Tension within a apocalyptic confinement. But the moment all the monster shows it kinda ruined everything. CGI looks so fake and backward the original Star Wars might looks better LOL.,Watching it alone in the dark , omg , I\\'m only at episode 2 , I\\'m in deep $#!+,I just completed season 1 and I can tell you that each episode left my jaw on the floor. It\\'s unusual to see people realistically go through their point of absolute breaking with horror. The acting was superb and the plot twists incredible. I\\'m seriously just in awe.,Having read the webtoon I expected alot from this series but unfortunately it failed to meet \"my\" expectations . The story was great but the direction wasn\\'t . People who haven\\'t read the comic won\\'t understand how great Sweet Home really is.,Very good story and characters but it has an awful cgi.,The first few episodes of the show had me completely invested in it. From episode 7 onwards, it lost me. The writing is just too inconsistent. Far too much time is spent on characters introspection, and not enough spent reinforcing the world the writers are trying to build.I Googled a few questions I had about the show and came across post after post - from those who have read the web comic - lamenting the fact that certain information wasn\\'t included in the show, and questioning why background information was included. I have to agree with them. Far too much time is spent showing us flashbacks. We don\\'t need \"origin\" stories as the characters are already in a dire situation that\\'s going to change their personality going forward. What we need are explanations of why certain events are happening now, why certain monsters seemingly appear from nowhere and a bit more time spent showing us character interactions in the here-and-now.The soundtrack is good. Unlike some, I also really like the CGI. Yes, it\\'s cheap but it\\'s well done and the style appeals to me. Some of the early monsters are reminiscent of those glimpsed in old films like Beetlejuice.,OK. At times the plot, actions and motivation of the characters are incomprehensible but it does eventually manage to develop a theme everyone an understand.The Monsters, although they play less and less of a role are outstandingly doneJust watch and enjoy it. Its not a western show and that\\'s what makes it different and fresh,I knew that Korean films can be refreshing so when i picked this i was not suprised. Interesting story something between walking dead Mist and Evil dead. Some really good asian actors .Negatives:Some times the script or the way people react is reallly stupid . I do not know if this is a Asian or Korean trope but like in episode 8 that one really cool character dies and the rest look at him for over 5 minutes to die without even trying to help him. This repeats again and again. It reminds me the stories you hear about china that people do not help people in problem but walk away. Who knows Still a good show much better than other trash that Netflix produces.,The best show based on a manga/webtoon? No, it is not. However, the show is compelling and takes you slowly in the story that unfolds a bit more every episode. Once you finished the last episode you start to see it is a rare gem that will not please everyone. For a change i liked it kept me guessing and i truely like the drama that gets inder your skin. Characters are both loveable and hateable. Worth watching!,Everything about this is awful. The graphics, the storyline, the terrible acting.....don\\'t waste your time. I really hope they make a second season. A couple of the better actors definitely had their potential wasted on this.,I\\'ve not read the source material if it matters.The plot isn\\'t anything special, but it isn\\'t bad. Execution is overall terrible, tho.CGI was god awful for this day and age. Guessing it\\'s from low budget, but that doesn\\'t make it any better to look at.The worst cinematography I\\'ve ever seen. There were part of scenes that were missing entirely, honestly didn\\'t it was possible for this to happen. Scenes would get so chopped up that you wouldn\\'t be able to tell what just happened.If you don\\'t like Imagine Dragons stay away from this show, every episode has a dose of them, makes the corny moments even cornier.And yes, show is overly corny at times and the acting can get terrible.Please take my review in to consideration. I never though a piece of entertainment could be this bad and make me wonder how anyone could enjoy it. I truly think it\\'s a waste of time and I want to save a couple of people from slogging through this mess, hoping it would get better the next episode.,The actors are doing a great job, casting is amazing. That is the only reason this show doesn\\'t get 1/10. The main show however is slow as dirt, every episode is the same. You can actually skip several episodes and not miss out on the overall plot. (Episode 5-7 are just fillers)\\r\\nThe first episode was interesting and had potential, but then it\\'s just the same story line over and over again. Monsters appear when the plot demands it and humans squabble over useless things. Like a monster that is 3 metre tall and weighs 200 kilo somehow appears INSIDE the building, despite being shown outside in the first episode, and somehow got in without making a single sound despite him having to break down walls in order to move his huge body around the corridors.\\r\\nIn the end you just find yourself waiting for the show to end, you don\\'t care about the characters at all.This show is unfortunately a huge waste of time. There are many good Korean shows, but this is not one of them.,I really loved the theme of this series. Being agoraphobic I can totally relate to this series. It would be interesting to know how the would became cronanberg in a short time.,This show started well, after the 1st episode the show went downhill in the middle. Last 3 episodes is very good which saved the whole show.If you are a horror fantasy/Monster genre fan, then this show is for you. Others can skip it. Hellbound is better.,Only just scraped a 7.I don\\'t write many reviews but feel compelled to write one because I was emotionally involved with this. The problem is it was just all over the place. I ended up loving the characters but the back stories are scant and incomplete. Sometimes aspects of the plot, particularly context just don\\'t add up. It\\'s doing a lot, yet remains quite shallow. For example, what is the explanation for the infection that creates the monsters? Are they leaving this for a series 2?All in all very frustrating yet, bizarrely, enjoyable too.Word of warning, i tried subs and dubs and enjoyed subtitles best. However I noticed that the dubbing is very different from the subtitles, and sometimes the meaning is outright contradictory. For example right at the end when firefighter lady (who rocks btw) is told \"your mission is incomplete/you failed the mission\".If it\\'s your kind of thing you\\'ll like it.Squid Game however it is not.,This is really worth a watch, first episode was a little slow but holy crap after the first it really took off. So honestly just endure that first episode and The rest will just fly by.,I\\'m only on episode 3 but wow. This show is pretty dang great. I love the monster\\'s and the characters. The music goes great with the intense fighting scenes. I have been excited for this sence I first watched the trailer.,This show started off strong, even the terrible CGI wasn\\'t enough to drive me way, but after the first 3 episodes sitting through it became a real struggle. After 3 straight episodes of boredom and a huge lack of action, plot, or character development I can\\'t justify wasting anymore time on this one. 3 stars for 3 really solid episodes of horror (again with terrible CGI),They better release season 2 ASAP cause i can\\'t wait!!!,I\\'m always skeptic with Netflix tv shows. But damn. DAMN. This tv show is amazing. The characters, the acting, the atmosphere, AMAZING. Give it a watch and you won\\'t be disappointed.\\r\\nCannot wait for season 2.,I thought it was a bit silly at first and njoabke, but wasn\\'t sure I would make it past E1 but the creatures or monsters or zombies, you chose, were shocking and scary enough with intense moments that I just couldn\\'t stop watching..mind you I am on E2..but I find more things to like about it as it goes on.,How are people this slow and weak? Makes it very painful to watch. Character build up is lacking, hard to follow... And did I mention the characters are made to look slow, weak, and dumb? If this is addicting it is only because there has literally been NOTHING good on NF in a while.,Its good effort they tried to follow sweet home webtoon but most of it doesnt follow same like the comic. Also the ending totally different. They didnt even potray properly why main character fight the desire to prevent him from turning monster. He actually want to go to to his fav concert according to comic. And also he will talk to mosterous design of himself too many times not only one or two. Also in the series i didnt get sweet home atmosphere. In comic, main character will despise his own family and won\\'t even shed a tear wen they dead but at the end he will giv in to his desire to protect all people that was with him and also in the imagination world he wil return to his dead family side happily. Tats y its sweet home. Also because the music title. Then only he wil turn into monster. They didnt even insert the scene where the monsters will turn into human sized egg and born again with no memory. So many flaws. Anyway the comic is my fav. It gave me goosebumps and also heart ache at the same time,The webtoon was really amazing and i enjoyed it through out the entire series. But when it got adapted, it became super lame story. So many great characters got deleted from existence. On top of that, the pacing was super slow, heck, even slower than a snail. The main character does not even feel like he is the main character. Instead, the side characters feels more like the MC. How is that even possible? I swear the MC literally has like 30 minutes of screen time in THE ENTIRE SERIES. Furthermore, the character development in this series abosolutely close to zero. NONE! I seriously don\\'t understand how this drama even got higher rating than 3. K-drama watchers are delusional.,Could have been good, only fails on:\\r\\nSickening stupid story\\r\\nNauseating dialog\\r\\nDisgusting chracters\\r\\nRepulsive actors\\r\\nOtherwise is perfect.,This show only gets better episode by episode. The characters are interesting and the monsters are unique, the story keeps you hooked as they reveal more and more about the characters and the \"curse\" (or whatever you wanna call it). Perfect combination of survival, monsters, action and drama.\\r\\nThe only negative thing I could think of is the cgi, but it didn\\'t even bother me that much since the storyline is so good.,I indulged myself and watch the show to the end. To many characters, confused, poor screenplay, bad bad CGI, you cant make any bonds with the characters. Maybe for this new generation (millenniums) who love this kind of nonsense, it will make any sense at all... Don\\'t even bother to watch!,While reading Webtoon, I kept saying they must make this tv series. When I heard Netflix is making a live action,I was devastated. I thought they gonna ruin it but it turned out amazing. Whole story is thriller; no resting, no waiting, anything can happen any moment. You will be nervous all the time when you are watching because this is how it needs to be. If you want something slow and full of philosophy, go watch something else.Great acting and environment. Totally recommend.,Title says it all. I really liked this show and am interested to see if good reception can increase the SFX budget for season 2.Biggest flaw is probable that the Warriors song by Imagine Dragons is played for EVERY major fight scene.... first time was great, but otherwise it starts detracting from the scene....,Don\\'t know how people can give negative comments on this...Just ignore those low lives and watch it.,The first 2 Episodes were fun, getting to know the characters was great. Action with the Monsters also great.\\r\\nafter that the show fell flat. Horror got lesser so did the action. Drama was tried, but since not much is happening it got boring pretty quickly.\\r\\nThe characters remain the same throughout the whole show (apart from 1 bad ass which is actually the most intersting character). So if you know them in the first episode, you know them until the last episode.\\r\\nPace is the greatest disapointment here. Story was okay, there was enough suspense. but not enough for 10 Episodes. should had been 6 Episodes ideally.\\r\\nLast episode, was the worst. Nothing was revealed, viewers waited 9 episodes to get at least some answers. but in greed for the next season, they revealed nothing.\\r\\nIn summary: I regret watching all the 10 episodes, hoping that something might happen in the next episode. and I wont make the same mistake, IF, season 2 came.,I\\'m more than half way through the first season and I enjoy it. I think the critique that this show is a bit Walking-Deadesque is slightly valid. But I think there\\'s far less interpersonal drama in this show.The characters are all quite different and sympathetic and aggravating in their own way. The conflicts are believable. The pacing is on point.But just like all East Asian horror, the show does feel like it leaves a bit too much to the viewers imagination. I remember being gobsmacked at one particularly inexplicable scene. There\\'s also a distinct lack of levity in this series. The subject matter and the shows approach are HEAVY. Almost too a fault.Still despite these shortcomings this one I\\'m glad I found and one that I plan on watching through to the end,I usually enjoy these type of genres and idea, however this series seem very difficult for me to be intrigued about or actually entertained. Like everyone else I was so hyped for this adaptation and the cast and the director. But Instead I felt annoyed and confused at times. Also who edited the music into the action/thrill scenes and thought the music was good choice for it??? I\\'m sorry but it felt so out of place and kills my mood. Also the mannequin stares that lasts for hours at the monsters was so unrealistic, like who tf gonna just stand there? Like we all have reflexes we aren\\'t puppets. For the budget the cgi wasn\\'t even the best, surely they all look unique and cool but it didn\\'t blend in with the surroundings. Also the characters felt way less interesting compared to the Webtoon. Not to mention the cliffhanger....ig they going for another season. Overall something I\\'d watch if I have nothing else to watch. Story 7/10, pace 4/10, acting 8/10, music 3/10. It didn\\'t feel memorable to me. Sorry to the fans since this is based on my experience and opinions.,I loved everything about this, character development, insane monsters, almost reinventing a genre.. but towards the end it just becomes a slow mo fest with dramatic music. Also all the monsters kind of disappear, and imagine dragons is played throughout.. Needed less music and more dialog.,Storyline was incredible and a good use of effects and music to match the action, every episode leaves you wanting more. The ending left it with a cliffhanger, so i hope netflix renews it with more depth how the disease started. also cried with samurai guy dying and sad with glasses guy dying,,,,Om of thw worst series. Plot is extremely weak and neither the story or characters connect to the viewers. Every episode more or less is having same content. It was so boring that just after two episodes didnt6 get courage to watch further.,They should stick to 16 episodes rather than 10 episodes.\\r\\nEvery thing happens very fast and rushed.\\r\\nMay be that\\'s why Netflix didn\\'t put dubbed version out,CGI is too cheap looking, totally puts me off. The monsters are more laughable than scary,Firstly the CGI is just atrocious, secondly the plot tends to drag at times and down right ridiculous at other times.,1st episode started off decent but the effects look like a stop motion claymation movie with the budget of 100 dollars and the music is chosen very badly at times not including the fact that the outside and the parking lot look like a haunted house you would find on your street during Halloween also some of the monsters look like edward scissor hands and leatherface from texas chainsaw massacre lol it was laughable at many part i would consider it more of a comedy only thing that is good about this is the acting but even that can\\'t save it from coming off as incredibly cheesy can\\'t believe it\\'s rated so high what were they watching?,I really liked this show. I never got bored with it. I just thought it was a unique idea with the monsters and the difference in the characters.,Okay, I\\'ve been watching k-dramas for years and Seeet Home really impressed me. I\\'ve never seen so many blood and monsters in korean shows. I know that CGI not great, but who cares with such nice script.,This is a really good show. A little different approach to the zombie theme but it\\'s good. Don\\'t listen to the haters . I have no idea why some people are rating this poorly. I binged the whole show and I didn\\'t feel bored or tired at any point. Every episode was filled with thriller and excitement .,Waste of precious lifetime. Worthless, meaningless, the lamest tv show project in a decade without any storyline, explanation and human common senses. The garbage,So glad I watched this. It\\'s not my normal kinda thing but it flipping brilliant. So different to anything else out at the minute . Really well cast, too. There had better be a season 2!! Definitely, definitely worth watching. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,I really love Comic version, but this TV series is so horrible.... they changed it to comedy with total awkward parts,....,At the beginning I didn\\'t gave this show many chances, but after two episodes I really got into it - I finished all episodes in 24 hours.\\r\\nThis is not your average Asian series. At first, I didn\\'t like the combination of Drama and SF but later it didn\\'t matter so much. This show is so good made, that mostly all events go together smoothly.\\r\\nIf you did like Stranger Things, \"Sweet Home\" is a must-try.,I watched this drama first then I went to see the comic, I thought both of them have plus points and minus points. In the drama, the special effects and some descriptions of characters are very well, and there are also some drama original characters, I think that it\\'s not bad. But the plots of some part were not described deeply, that\\'s a little unfortunately.,I can say it\\'s the best series of 2020.Every episode was just amazing.There weren\\'t a second that i was bored.I enjoyed every second.It\\'s a must watch series.Eagerly waiting for season 2.,Well written believable characters that develop throughout the series, which is not to common in this genre. You actually care about these characters. Cgi is not the best since the budget of this series was not big, but it\\'s good enough to generate suspense and 1000 times better than what I grew up with (tried rewatching some cgi dependant from my childhood, I remembered them as almost real but to my surprise with today\\'s standards they are horrible, my video games look better).I would rate this series 8.5/10 (but I\\'ll put 10 here to balance some of the very bad reviews that does not make this series justice),A fresh breath from American full of politics content. It is a first show I watched on Netflix in many months. Hopefully, when Hollywood dies because of their terrible movies and TV shows, we will have normal content that doesn\\'t force opinions down your throat with a gentleness of skilled torturers from a secret CIA facilities.,Don\\'t bother with positive comments from webtoon fans, or the bad critics, this series is really cool.\\r\\nand it worth every second of your life\\r\\nthe ones who disliked it just didn\\'t understand the series, or didn\\'t even complete it, prob just a stupid brains,\\r\\nI CAN SAY NOW, THAT I\\'ll DIE HAPPY NOW !\\r\\njust waiting for season 2 now, hopeful it will be amazing as season 1\\r\\nit just get 1.4 Billion views from the world, do you what it means ?, it\\'s a really 2ufh29ef9e2fo;2efjifwuf9weu just watch it or die !,Don\\'t bother with positive comments from webtoon fans, or the bad critics, this series is really cool.\\r\\nand it worth every second of your life\\r\\nthe ones who disliked it just didn\\'t understand the series, or didn\\'t even complete it, prob just a stupid brains,\\r\\nI CAN SAY NOW, THAT I\\'ll DIE HAPPY NOW !\\r\\njust waiting for season 2 now, hopeful it will be amazing as season 1\\r\\nit just get 2.1 Billion views from the world, do you what it means ?, it\\'s a really 2ufh29ef9e2fo;2efjifwuf9weu just watch it or die !,but still the tension with the characters, quite disappointed alot of them survived; ik haha it\\'ll cool if alot of em died. 💀💀💀PREDICTABLE. END WITH A CLIFFHANGER.Rated this 9 cuz the cast r hot 😎,Although I\\'m not really into Asian horror, doesn\\'t matter if movies or series, I gave this series a chance and I\\'m glad I did. The story has kept me interested and the actors are really good (even if sometimes it\\'s a bit over the top). For once, a Netflix series has very good dubbing. The English version is, by far, the best dubbing of a Netflix series that I have seen. Some of the special effects\\r\\n(monsters) are excellent (the half beheaded creature who constantly says he can\\'t see is, scary and hilarious) . Well worth the watch :),Loved it, watched the whole of season 1 in a single sitting & leaves you wanting more for sure. Give it a go you will not be disappointed. I\\'m an English speaker so read the subs as it went along but don\\'t let that put you off.,I watched the whole thing a few months ago, and now I\\'m watching it again! There\\'s just something about this series that I love. The actors. The special effects. The story. It\\'s very original and fresh. I am thrilled that there\\'s going to be a 2nd season! You never know if Netflix is going to cancel a good show or not. Sweet Home, and Sweet Tooth are definitely GOOD SHOWS! IMO.,I was browsing Netflix and I saw Sweet Home and I decided to check it out. Wasn\\'t so sure abt it after the first episode. But, I continued to watch the series and by the end of ep-2. I was hooked! I just finished it. It\\'s one of the best series on Netflix. You should def check it out.,Visually impeccable the vibrant colors add a different feel, good storytelling and unique in many areas, also has things it can improve on so I\\'ll keep it short and say I\\'m waiting on that on a 2nd season.,Was there only enough money in budget for Warrior by Imagine Dragons to be played every fight scene? Fun fight sequences but very poor character development.,When I first started watching ep1 it seemed slow n boring but then the story started to get more interesting n I ended up bingewatching the entire season in bed. Now I\\'m screaming for season 2!,It sounds like this was a webtoon series n the people giving the series a low rating r those who have already read the webtoon .I havent read the webtoon n dont plan to SO please just watch it for it\\'s sake! n dont spoil it for those who r not into webtoons,Mind blowing series second season deserve this movie. Squid game 1st second this movie i watching my best Korean movie. So I think this movie watching every movie lovers.#One_of_the_best_series I\\'ve ever seen.,Was not expecting this one will be such a good tv show, watched whole season in two evenings! Episode after episode it was hard to stop watching and go to sleep. I dont know why others hating the soundtrack, i liked it a lot:),This show is something else !\\r\\nIt\\'s gross and scary at the same time you can\\'t help but watch It\\'s very addictive i love it It\\'s definitely my kind of show it\\'s never boring,Great series with amazing cool actors,lovely story,This is not only thriller. Thriller+Emotion+twist=Sweet Home.,This show built up so well over ten episodes to an absolutely gripping season finale. While the special effects weren\\'t great, the plot, acting and characters were incredible. I really hope this gets renewed!,I know monsters are not real, but thats not what i mean when i said UNREALISTIC, unrealistic is for those characters who suddenly have sympathy for something (monster) for no reason or sympathy for someone who they did spent time with. the acting of some that is unbelievably calm in a situation of horror. its the acting of some rude characters who doesn\\'t really justify in this kind of situation. i didn\\'t give up watching from ep1 to end. but it didn\\'t gave me excitement, i felt more of angry for stupidity of some characters.,Binge watched in a day, amazing show, last episode was slightly confusing and not pieced together well, that being said the last episode is still good if you skim over the blanks and it also leaves it wide open for a second season. This is another piece of amazing Korean cinema, if you like #Alive, I Saw The Devil, Train to Busan and enjoyed them, this is right up your alley,Honestly, it\\'s difficult to write a good plot and script for any zombie film. Still, I think they did a great job with this. Coming from a gamer geek, the variations in the zombie were really quite interesting to me. The struggle of facing the sudden apocalyptic crisis is well-portrayed in the story and by the cast. I honestly find most zombie films too boring and predictable, but this series was like a K version of Resident Evil - in a good way. Definitely worth watching. The start can get a little draggy - as all zombie films tend to be but don\\'t give up just yet!,This show is incredibly fun to watch. The atmosphere is compelling, it follows a lot of familiar (and beloved) tropes while still introducing unique spins on things, and the acting is solid. There are incredibly frustrating aspects to the show, which I assume is a result of adapting a webtoon. For example, a webtoon panel might have someone staring while a fight is going on, but in the show it comes across as ridiculous because they just stare into space for 30 seconds at a time. It gets to a point where you\\'re genuinely in awe any of these people have survived. It\\'s a bit campy--a monster screaming \"PROTEIN\" is really hard to take seriously especially within a show that takes itself very seriously.I\\'d never read the webtoon before watching. I did pick it up after finishing the show and I think it explains why the show feels awkward at times. The webtoon has a lot more levity and doesn\\'t take itself as seriously. There\\'s a lot of humor to break up the tension and make characters likeable. The show is so determined to be gritty and realistic that it gives itself no space for suspension of disbelief. Again, a monster screaming about protein feels wildly out of place in the show but suits the webtoon.If you go into the show without expecting it to perfectly match the webtoon and are able to take it as it is, you\\'ll have fun. It\\'s a love it or hate it kind of show and I think approaching it as a campy monster show will set expectations more appropriately. A lot of reviewers said to give it 3 episodes to kick in, but expecting anyone to invest 3 hours before a show picks up is unreasonable. If you like the first episode, you\\'ll probably like the whole show and vice versa.,Well worth a watch. Can be very violent and graphic at time but very enjoyable. Hoping for a season 2 🇮🇪,Very very very nice web series please release season 2 FAST,The plot is okay, the visuals are good, yet ridiculous, and the acting and story are about as cheesy as they could be. It\\'s as if they were trying to go for that.,I was on my toes the whole time; there was always so much going on. At first it was a bit overwhelming, being introduced to so many characters, but I really like getting to know each and every one of them. Almost none of the characters nor scenes bored me.The concept of the show is pretty captivating. People are turning into monsters left and right, and one doesn\\'t know when someone will turn. The residents of a certain building construct a small society in order to protect themselves, and shenanigans ensue.\\r\\nI do feel like the show could be a bit confusing at times, not showing us or not finishing showing us what someone was doing or what is going on with them. It\\'s still not very clear exactly how someone turns into a monster, so I wish the show was clearer on that. I also do wish we got to delve into more of some characters, since they were great, but there were so many of them. But I suppose there was only a certain amount of time for everything, and though I would\\'ve liked the season or the episodes to be longer to clarify the plot more and explore the characters more, I feel like the show still did good enough. Either way, that just leaves space for more clarity and character background and development next season, which I really hope will come.This show made me think a lot (What\\'s to come next? Who can be trusted? Who\\'s the real monster here? Will they turn into one?), and it did make me feel pain at certain points. But it was so worth it.The music was also really good, especially BeWhy\\'s OST, Side by Side. I\\'ve seen some people complain about the use of Warriors by Imagine Dragons, but honestly, I think it was fine.,Watched it over 2 times already! Can\\'t wait for the next season!!The ending is a bit different than the webtoon so I hope there will be season 2!,There is always an annoying character, an useless one, a crazy one, bystanders in every Korean drama. This drama has it all and it makes the whole thing pretty bad.,Shows are a hour long 10 episode series. Even with a slow start the Sweet Home never lack suspicious, with eye covering encounters with the infected and constant battle of survival and trust it made for a great watch after beating my brain silly with phycological thrillers I just needed to watch something with feeling! The actors put on a brilliant show of emotions draw you in for a fantastic finish primarily over the last three episodes. At times I felt like I was watching an anime. MUST WATCH.,You might think the first episode is boring but please wait cause it gets better!! It s not very horror tho, but it doesn t ruin the series. It had some weird scenes but overall it was an amazing kdrama. I really hope for a season 2.,It\\'s a while ago that I watched this show but I always had an odd feeling that it wasn\\'t what it could have been.Yes, the CGI was (compared to other shows) not as good.The acting, it was fine, nothing out of place tbh.But the story? *scratches head\\r\\nidk what the show is about actually, no clue. There are monsters, yeah, people suddenly turn into monster... and, that\\'s it.How... actually did the firefighter woman got out so easily and was able to get a car, drive to... somewhere without being attacked by monsters but instead being caught by the military? Lot of question marks.I was angry when the prisoners suddenly killed some of the residents... and, how did the prisoners suddenly appeared? It was extremely random.On one hand the resident can\\'t leave the complex, on the other hand the firefighter woman and random prisoners can walk and drive outside without trouble.Nah, really, idk where the story wants to lead us, no clue.Why do people turn suddenly into monsters? Probably I want to know too much but... the answer would make this show a lot more enjoyable.,Lee jin wook is so perfect on this series hope for another season. The whole cast is great and fantastic\\r\\nVery thrilling and each episode are not boring.,Starts off well, and falls apart very quickly. The beginning was very well paced and even the CGI was pretty good. Then after a couple promising episodes in the show stops making sense and becomes a string of random plot lines and awkward emotional scenes where characters just stare at each other and cry, most of the time for no reason other than to kill time (this could have been 4 or 5 episodes instead, with fewer characters).\\r\\nEventually character development and motivations just fall apart and it becomes a mystery why anything happens or any character does anything.\\r\\nAlso a lot of seemingly important things happen that are never addressed again.,Great acting, awesome storyline, amazing cinematography and of course genius directing!!\\r\\nAddictive series !! Must recommended for pple who love the adventure genre !!,If you haven\\'t read the webtoon and you enjoy watching apocalyptic movies or shows I think you will find it entertaining, however if you previously read the webtoon and you are a fan of it I don\\'t think you will enjoy this.I had big expectations for this show as I previously read the webtoon, however the adaptation they did on the show is so bad.1. The portrayal of the main character is awful. In the show he is more like a side character, he doesn\\'t have any personality, development or a connection with any other character, they completely changed him.2. They introduce characters that didn\\'t existed before (they had more screen time than the main character) and removed characters that were essential for the story on the web comic.3. The story is so rushed that it doesn\\'t have any impact when a character dies.4. The story is so different to the original one, i felt like I was watching the walking dead.5. There are a lot of annoying characters that don\\'t add anything to the plot (they\\'re just there).6. Jisu is a very important character on the webtoon (she is one of the main ones) but here she is not (just like hyun), I was very disappointed by this.7. Also the music doesn\\'t fit the atmosphere of some of the scenes. I remember that in a scene with Hyun that\\'s supposed to be scary or intense they put a rap, like... what? (It was a nice song but still).In conclusion I don\\'t recommend to watch this if you are a fan of the webtoon.,If you love your time and life than don\\'t waste them to watch this series. The director is confused in whole movie if he want to make japanese cartoon, zombies movie or a movie inspired from resident evil. No story, no concept, bad direction, bad story, bad start, bad ending total waste of time and I lost my mind after watching this.,I have no idea why there are so many haters reviewing this series (especially the ones who didn\\'t even watch it all) I thought it was great. The monsters are very cool, well done CG critters, and while not all of them are original, the eye-guy and gremlin-alike listener monsters were awesome. The characters aren\\'t all great, but the way that they\\'re narrowed down to the ones which are genuinely interesting is really quite well done.It\\'s not a series for everyone, but if you can bring yourself to watch to the end of the first episode, you\\'ll have a lot of fun.,I can\\'t believe all the bad reviews. There is nothing like this I\\'ve ever watched that is actually well made. The first two episodes or so I was sceptical and didn\\'t really know what to think of this. But it\\'s like the acting and the quality of the series got even better episode by episode.The first Korean tv series that I watched completely and will keep on watching when they release more episodes.I don\\'t know where all the bad reviews are coming from. I really liked the series. It had genuine, totally not unnecessary deaths and game styled cgi which I think was good.I liked the unrealistic brutality of the series. Definitely looking forward to the next season coming by the end of the year.,My favourite tv series in 2020.this is the best korean drama i ever watched.all the actors and actresses are acting really well.i expect netflix countinue this tv series.,Graphics are not realistic, at one point I was laughing at how ridiculous the \"monsters\" looked. One of them looked exactly like a Halloween mask bought at the dollar store.The show also focuses on wayyyy too many characters, to point where you\\'re confused on the importance of their role. Back and forth between characters, constantly. A lot of scenes had no importance nor did they add any complexity to the storyline. The timeline of the scenes also make no sense, leaving you frustrated. Overall a super messy show.Watch this only if you\\'re under lockdown and have binged everything else on Netflix.,Awesome series adapted from web toon so far, well written storyline, superb cgi.. its character development really damn good! you can just imagine i cannot stop after watching 1 episode.. how ironic a pathetic young man wants to kill him self, change to warrior who wants to save everyone..,Ceritanya bagus banget!!! I rewatch this all the time, please give us season 2 pd-nim.... You know the ending say it too loud,I really loved this show must watch for monster lovers nd action horror drama fantasy 🔥🔥🔥 .....AF,Hello, I will honestly say the series is beautiful and its story is very imaginary, it also contains bloody and weak fear, the characters for the first time I see them and they are beautiful and I rate the series 7 out of 10,, and also I liked the beginning and end song of the series.,I\\'m looking forward to the rest, it\\'s a very nice series,The trailer caught my eye so I went into watching this show with confusion and man it did not disappoint! I binged the 10 episodes in two days. Monsters/Thriller type of shows are my thing and Sweet Home brought all of that into this first season!Each characters has their own agendas and the character building was captured well that you end up enjoying the characters individually as well as when they get together as a group. The emotional turmoil that I had for the main characters and the supporting role was overwhelming. I find myself attached and crying over certain storylines and scenes and it was sooo good!The show really give you the, \\'what type of a human you want to be when you are stuck in a dire situation?\\' and I felt that.The whole cast overall was superb in their given role and the ending was just such a cliff that I wish season 2 was released now so I can binge through it too lol.Give this show a chance! The pacing is really good and the suspense, oh man the suspense!,I watched this series because it has been a trending for a long time in netflix. It has an interesting start, but I lost my interest afterwards. I just finished this drama because I\\'m bored and nothing to do that time, not because I was hooked up.,Netflix please pick up or do another season of this show don\\'t wait for ever to do it either like your company seems to do. This show has been in the top 10 I figured you would at least have good taste. This show is scary yet in depth with characters it\\'s story line is interesting as well.,God damn I enjoyed this show the monsters, the charecters, the conflict and mmmm that imagine dragons song just boosts how truly epic the moments on this show areI particularly enjoy that they show off the deformed almost eldritch monsters are in this show it annoys me to the extreme when we see little bits of monsters or they are hidden in shadows or dim lighting in shows so it\\'s always a good time when a show goes balls to the wall crazy with their monsters (that is the main attraction to shows like this),I love end of the civilization, and this is a very good one about it. I have not seen the webtoon so I can not comment on the virtues of the webtoon. Yet in the series characters get developed and the acting is pretty good. Directier had done a very good job and the screens and the palet they choose are stunning. The amount of gore and blood is not over the board. If you love apocalyptic series this is one of the very good ones.,This series was a lot of fun. It kept me engrossed in the story and almost did not want the episodes to end!! It was that engaging. Its full of great performances. It reminded me of Lost with everyone\\'s backstory or arc. Everyone was battling their own personal monsters.,Thanks to netflix now we see more animes and mangas. Sweet home is actually a mahwa (korean comic series, manga is japanese) so in tv series acting of the some characters are may look exaggerated but compare to the japanese tv series adapted from animes (e.g. Alice in Borderland) this show has much better actings. Overall it is fun to watch, good for spending your quarantine time.,Absolutly garbage series. Dont waste your time here on this show.,Too many plot holes and nonsense character decision. I can\\' imagine how bad of their dialogues are. This is the worst korean series i,ve ever watched for sure.,A novel take on the zombie apocalypse genre where the \\'zombies\\' have superpowers. The star of the show is the set design and cinematography as it really brings you in to the show\\'s world.I do wish the show had explored some deeper themes that were ripe for the taking. The \\'curse\\' is brought on by human desire, but how and why?Acting is generally good even as the characters are mostly one dimensional. Character depth is mostly attempted via flashbacks and death scenes. Editing is choppy and it can be hard to figure out what\\'s going on at times.Nevertheless Sweet Home is worth the watch. Hoping that Netflix produces a season 2.,CGI is laughable at best and the characters don\\'t develope. Story goes nowhere. Please save your time.,A directorial masterpiece, excitement and suspense, a narration of events in an interesting way, far from boredom, the interconnectedness of events and interests,I really hope there will be season 2...\\r\\nAfter the last episode, there are so many ways to continue the series :),I don\\'t like zombie movies, but this is absolutely brilliant. From episode one to the end, it\\'s interesting, lot\\'s of action, special effects brilliant, good story line. It\\'s the best series for 2020 for me!\\r\\nBrilliant brilliant brilliant!!!!\\r\\nI hope there is a season 2. 🙏🏻 🙏🏻 🙏🏻,Filled with adrenaline, yet sad and heartwarming at the same time.,Awesome series... Must watch. Complete drama,action,adventure,emotion......,Wow! Absolutely wow!. The plot is phenomenal. The characters are amazing. The storyline always engaging! Our main characters except for those awful ones, make you pull for the human race. And absolutely make you want to jump in and protect those in need. I\\'m loving this so much!,I had second thoughts about starting it but after the first two episodes it just got better and better. I do think that Asian horror series and movies are kind of too much about their \"horror scenes\" but this isn\\'t the case here. Although it has some scenes to prove its theme there isn\\'t much attention paid to them. I really liked the plot and I loved the different details and personas of every character. The whole series is fascinating and keeps you on edge all the time. It\\'s like every episode ends with a cliffhanger. The background stories of the characters are very interesting and I liked how the series although it has a dark theme it pays much attention to the relationships and emotions among humans. I would really recommend it to anyone who likes horror-action series.,So many parts in the show were very epic, but I felt there were so many moments in this show that had a lot of cliches.Still a good watch, but felt there wasn\\'t a lot of creativity.,The world building is fantastic, it is full of interesting characters with excellent character development. Brilliant acting. Fast paced and full of action. The CGI can be better but I can look past it because the overall production is 1st class.,This drama is not perfect. The CGI monsters are so bad that they are almost comical. The plot is messy and can be confusing.However, where this drama succeed is in character development. Many of the characters are unlikeable in the beginning but as the story progresses, they become more relatable. Most of the characters are given enough time to show that they are multifaceted. And by the time some of these characters gets killed off, you actually feel the lose. Another thing the drama achieved is leaving a sense of hope, the idea that people will survive any adversity if they all band together.As strange as this may sound, despite its dark gloomy setting, this drama is a feel good drama.,This Show is so dumb but hillarious in the same way, that you just can\\'t stop watching. Don\\'t expect perfect cinematography or screenplay. Neither believable characters, their decicions or motivation nor a plausible plot. Don\\'t bother watching if any of these points are important to you to enjoy a Show.This Show lives from its Monsters and visuals and gore moments. If you\\'re into this stuff, enjoy the ride. The Action is mostly good. The CGI is bad by todays stadards. But all in all its fun.,This definitely got me hooked! Was kinda turned off by the initial trailer cos it looked like poorly done CG monsters in a \\'pseudo-horror\\' drama. But boredom got to me and I decide to risk one episode nonetheless. Never looked back since. The entire storyline and plot truly hooked me, as with the good emotions of the actors during the 10-episodic series. Now I can\\'t wait for season 2 to commence!,I\\'d recommend it if you have a lot of free time and nothing to watch. The only thing i hate about this show is the music & songs. I think they did a bad\\r\\nthing when it comes to music & songs , because\\r\\ni watched many scenes in the show that would be\\r\\nbetter without the music. It\\'s like the show\\'s crew\\r\\nare ordered to put these songs & music by force.,The show is very well done. Great monsters, very creative with lots of plots twists, jump scares, blood and mayhem. Good character builds tell individual story lines that keep you guessing who is a monster and who is not. Stick with it and by the third episode you will be hooked.,The acting is so good the graphics are amazing\\r\\nThe storyline is perfect, wont let you feel bored, we need another season due unfinished ending ..,Show is great, not as the webtoon but still great. Some monsters are really bad makeup artists made, like a nurse with syringes on her nipples, really?! Thank God the main mosters are not like that. The only big con is the song selection, korean trap song and imagine dragons, literally, a stupid song of imagine dragon in the best moments of the series, completely destroys immersion. Probably should have gine the soundtrack selection to someone else.,Great story, good acting, scary at times. First half of season one is awesome, second half is so-so.,I enjoyed this adaption of the webtoon but, I wish they would have followed the webtoon a bit more. The deaths of Wook and Yuri did not seem right. Though they could be supposed deaths since at the end it showed Wook in the car, but that could have been the evil infected who turned into a gooey like substance who took over his body. The romance between Jae-heon and Ji soo seemed weird to me too, but I do not know if the show followed the same ages as the webtoon. The meaningless deaths of Hyuk and a couple of others just made me upset after reading the webtoon. I am happy that they could continue the show though but, since the webtoon is over and has a completely different direction the creators will have to come up with brand new ideas. Hyun in this show mentioned in other reviews does seem more like a side character to me. While reading the webtoon I could see his growth and his fight with desire. Still overall people who have read the webtoon should watch the show. Even though it is different, the show gives you a new perspective on the series and hiw things could have happened. Though some changes might make you mad, think of it as an adaption and at least hiw the show ends there can be more to the story because the webtoon may never have another part. I have noticed the author of Sweet Home writes stories that are usually straight to the point and short. If you have not read the webtoon I ask you to read it to understand how the story was originally written. I really wish other stories by this author would be turned into a live action.,This is one fascinating watch. The show is entirely carried by its strong premise: a band of survivors hunkers down in an apartment complex while the people outside are turning into monsters.There are a couple things to like: the monsters are truly gross and grotesque and the animations are surprisingly good for a TV show. Cinematography and the use of colors can be quite beautiful, and some characters are quite interesting (albeit they are in the minority).Here\\'s what I don\\'t like and why I would not recommend this show: scenes are drawn out with people just staring into nothingness, and the show tries to cheaply evoke emotions in melodramatic ways like overtly and unduly zooming in on distressed people\\'s faces. People often don\\'t react to or even acknowledge the things that are happening around them, which at times results in truly jarring situations that do not make any sense at all. Also, there is a serious problem with editing. Sometimes there is almost no context to what is happening on screen, like a plan carried out that was not discussed beforehand, making the viewer guessing in a frustrating way.At the end of the day, I do enjoy watching Sweet Home, because this show is unlike any other show I\\'ve seen before. But you have to be willing to embrace the bizareness of it all.,I have no clue what my measly opinion is worth - here it is anyway:The animation and live action blend needed some work, however, I thought after the first few episodes it got MUCH BETTER - I enjoyed the blend even when the effects weren\\'t high quality. I felt it was artistic.The storyline had me hooked. I ended up invested in many of the characters, including the secondary characters - for me that\\'s tough to do. At first I was afraid the show would shy away from certain themes - heavens to betsy was I wrong. They didn\\'t pull the punches or baby us through the drama. This seriously touched me. I\\'m raving about it.There are several interesting story lines that I hope they unravel in season 2 - fantastic take on monster drama (monsdrama) - and I\\'m on the edge of my seat for the next season. BRING IT ON.,Turned out better than I expected. probably among the best netflix of 2020,It\\'s just purely AMAZING!!!\\r\\ntruly all-star A-class casts!! Loved how each character really shines and really well depicted. The nuance of emotions is so well done.amazing CG!!!! The monsters are very carefully depicted and I can see how much they invested in this! AMAZING!!!!!I love the story itself, which is prob the best part! It doesn\\'t exactly follow the webtoon, but I love how it keeps the core and tells the story in a more cinematic way. I particularly love the part about how you fight against your desire / us and them.Really look forward to season 2! (Hope there is one!),Just finished the first episode. A lot of mystery and good horror. Not for people who want everything explained to them straight away. Or those who cant focus on more than one characters story at once.Everyone else, this is plain good K-Horror. Awesome,Netflix What did you do? Stop funding trash. I\\'d read the summary, thought this should be cool and dived into ep1~7. The acting is average at best,Among them, puppy\\'s acting the best. and Weird confusing storyline. boring conversations. Monsters aren\\'t as threatening as I thought. Overall, it was worst than I expected.\\r\\nDon\\'t waste your time watching this. This drama is like a teenage.,Watched this series because it seems promising after episode 1. However, after binged 5 episodes I was like \"wtf did I watch?\"There are too many scenes that has no impact to the whole story, unnecessary scene or plot like the one with the mobster and the child abuser. But, the most annoying part that got me tired and almost give up is that too many jumping scenes, stupid scenes and weird camera angles or such that sometimes left me confused and did not understand what was going on anymore.I stopped, give a shot to the webtoon version, and im glad I did because it is 100% better than this series. In the series, there is no explanation why they turned into monsters, why Hyun able to resist his desire, why Mr. An and Ji Su who had nosebleed seems to be fine and were not quarantined?, there is almost no monster rather than hulk outside the building making me wonder \"why didnt they just go?\", security guard, runner and spider guy were too weak, literally weird character development, weak bad guys, and literally different ending. Oh, and I hate how they make wook this way (he was a detective in webtoon)Maybe I am asking too much, maybe I was expecting too much for it to be like the webtoon (well, since the scripts on the first 5 episodes were the same as in the webtoon), but why so many flaws? I do not mind if netflix adapted it in its on way, but at least keep using the original webtoon as reference.So many potentials wasted.,I really don\\'t understand this story so I can\\'t enjoy it. the premise is unattractive and devoid of traction. many things that are not lacking, such as the way the random scene editing makes me uncomfortable watching. and also sudden stories like this and that. oh what a boring show. sorry.,Its plagued by a bad script with undeveloped characters and a ridiculous plot.Camera works and colour palettes are off, so does the music. oh the music are way off.there\\'s a potential but wasted. I hope you not waste your time watching this series.,This show is absolutely amazing. The plot alone is very interested. If you\\'re not a huge fan in the beginning trust me it will grow on you. The actors and character\\'s are all great of course some characters aren\\'t my favorites lol. But anyways please check it out and give it a good rating.,Nice Web Drama,I love Sweet Home Team.\\r\\nWaiting for the Season 2,The show I must admit does start slow but you will slowly see all these story elements come together in an amazingly creative way. You will grow attached to a lot of these characters due to the show\\'s commitment to explaining their characters throughly. The actual monsters themselves are extremely creative and I\\'m surprised how many there are in these 10 episodes. The only downfall of this show has to be the GCI of some of the monsters. Others are extremely well made due to the show\\'s commitment to makeup but others just have a look that can break immersion. Overall please don\\'t sleep on this show and hopefully season 2 is on its way! A true revolution in horror TV!,Perfectly portraits the today\\'s society.Very interesting. I\\'m watching it again for sure.\\r\\nMight not be for everyone.\\r\\nThe story line isn\\'t in chronological order so you have to think for yourself I really like that but not everyone thinks the same,Non stop action, monsters, drama, and gore! This is a wonderful example of Korean creativeness and how far TV shows have come. I am starting to become a fan of Korean acting, especially in Sweet Home, where everyone has a story that slowly unfolds with each episode and nobody are who they seem. The makeup is great with realistic scenes and the monsters CGI are a blend of new animation and classic effects. The latter episodes include a few more emotions and tears but the entertainment is still there -- you can\\'t have all action and no back story for the entire season. All in all I really enjoyed it.,You may want to watch this because you read the manhwa and liked it or thinking that this is original, DON\\'T DO IT I can\\'t call it an adaptation or original, it\\'s so different and so similar that the best I can do it\\'s call it a rip-off, they cut out so many really important things and replace them with comedy scenes or not replace it at all, same with characters, they replaced some important characters with secondary characters that you don\\'t even care when some of them die, they didn\\'t include any character development, unlike the original manhwa where almost everyone had that moment, the worst thing here is the ending, the ending in the original manhwa was pretty sad and definitely a tear jerker, but here is just a really really cheese cliffhanger, and I have no idea why they did that, cause the story was supposed to end, and from what I saw in this, they can\\'t make something good original to save their life, the next thing is the actors, these are the worst actors I have ever seen, and I can look past bad acting, but this one was just so painfully bad, if you liked this I really really recommend reading the original manhwa, it\\'s completely free on Webtoon so I don\\'t see why you wouldn\\'t.,I don\\'t write reviews but this one is under rated. This show is different , no silent promotions. Lot of unique characters showing different shades. In start, you think this is zombie show, but wait for it. It is not bang-bang , zombie killing bloody show. This one has good and meaningful pauses. Showing how different characters behave under panic and attack. It was impressive show with good special effect and mystery. Eagerly waiting for SEASON -2. Acting wise Lee Jin-Wook playing gangster is memorable .Don\\'t miss this one.,Me and my husband binged this show. It had me from the very beginning. I loved it and so will you! Looks like there will be a sequal!,This is easily the best zombie show ever made . It made walking dead look like children in terms of production , visuals and just overall freshness . I got so sick of the same zombie tropes that kept getting made over and over again . This is the first time in years that I actually enjoyed watching a show with zombies especially the lead who adds so much depth with his newfound ...(watch it yourself to see ) Try it ! You won\\'t regret it. Besides kingdom no other zombie show compares until the last of us gets released which I also have high hopes for .,I gave it a couple of episodes and now i\\'m stuck! Not the greatest CGI i\\'ve seen but an interesting story.,Having discovered Sweet Home on WEBTOON, I found this live action adaptation very lacking. Where the WEBTOON version felt chilling, dark, and authentic, this adaptation feels corny, over-stylized, and lacking depth. If you\\'re a fan of the comic, you might very well enjoy this, but I doubt it will be for the same reasons. When I heard that Sweet Home was getting a live action adaptation, I wondered whether or not it would be among the ~1% of live action adaptations that are actually worth watching. I have my answer now.,First off, the translation isn\\'t too clean. There are parts where the conversations just don\\'t make much sense so whoever was in charge of the subtitles made things a little tougher for the viewers. Decent acting but there\\'re times it makes no sense why a character would do what they do, just random events. And the directing is confusing. At least 6 times I found myself asking myself \"wait how did we get here?\"\" Did I accidentally skip 10min\". If I didn\\'t read the comic (which is miles better) I wouldn\\'t have understood the story at all.,This has been an absolutely awesome find. it\\'s amazing how they managed to make us hate & fall in love with few characters, all that in just 10 episodes. Can\\'t wait to see what\\'s next for Cha Hyun-Su.,The first episode is a masterpiece and I was positively impressed by the camera angles they used to film the series, they made everything more intriguing. The character introductions, their interactions with one another seem somewhat out of this world but realistic nevertheless.Reading the reviews I see both the ones praising it and the ones trashing it have 50-70% helpfulness and to be honest it\\'s well deserved: what I disliked was the show turning more \"basic\" as it went one and monsters becoming less and less common. It still managed to stay a solid good show until the end but the drop in quality is noticeable especially between the 1st and the rest of the episodes. They need to learn from The Walking Dead and not repeat their mistakes.The CGI is painfully obvious and some of the scenes may disturb the immersion, they really need to bump up the budget for the 2nd season. I also think that Warriors by Imagine Dragons shouldn\\'t have been in this series, it didn\\'t truly fit any scenes in which it was used and made me cringe a little, an original soundtrack would\\'ve been much better.I\\'m torn between giving a 7 or an 8 but since I feel like I have withdrawal symptoms and it has me longing for a second season I\\'ll give it an 8.,I\\'ve read the webtoon this was based on, and it was amazing. However, they\\'ve changed certain elements of the original story. Some of the characters are different - either different gender, different personality, different back story, different relationships, new characters and missing characters, to name a few.The show also deviates from the original story line despite the crux of it being the same. Now, this is an issue because some of the crucial parts of the original webtoon which makes us, as viewers, understand each character\\'s motives and choices are non-existent in the show. The little backstory that they give us just feels like filler content without actual consequence. My opinion of the show when compared to the original webtoon, is that it is disappointing.However, let\\'s judge this as a show of its own:The visuals look great but also terrible. The art feels like they have a good VFX team behind it, but the direction of the scenes with heavy use of the CGI just feels so low-budget. It kills the pseudo realism that the show could have portrayed.The soundtrack is fine, but the songs that they play during some of the action sequences feel so out of place. It does not fit the vibe of the show or the premise that has been set. The music feels like an attempt at overcompensating for the show\\'s inadequacies elsewhere.The script is all over the place with terrible pacing, and if you have not read the webtoon before, you\\'re left confused and hanging at certain times. It\\'s not coherent. The characters are unexpectedly helpless in a situation where they could actually do something, and are sometimes the opposite. Without spoiling much, you\\'ll find yourself at times pulling at your hair wondering why these characters made such absurd choices. Some choices just make no sense other than, it was the \"edgier\" choice. You don\\'t even root for or think of the primary protagonist as the protagonist of the show.The only good thing this show has going for it is how well the acting is. I can\\'t say much else about this. The show just feels like it had a lot of potential but fell below that quite hard.As a standalone show, I would give it a 6, but as a show based on the original webtoon, it\\'s probably a 3 or a 4 for me.In conclusion, due to the show\\'s terrible pacing and storytelling, it feels like a tribute or a homage to the original webtoon. However, as a fan, I am terribly disappointed in how they\\'ve butchered something so amazing.\\r\\nTL;DR Incoherent plot, terrible pacing, poor direction of the visuals.,Stopped watching for a moment after two episodes just to write this quick review. A fast paced, well scripted and wildly entertaining series with a wacky plot line. I hope it will feel just as funky and complete when I finish this binge.,Just watched the first 3 episodes.Just go see it without reading and knowing anything. If you love freaky horror, you\\'ll love this one!,Sweet Home has a cool premise. The apocalypse happens and our cast are waiting it out with possibility of monsters wrecking them or them turning into monsters. What makes the show not work for me are the performances of the actors and theses monsters themselves. Honestly, you don\\'t feel too much for this cast, 3 of the actors look like they either in a constant state or confusion or worry even when nothing is happening. There are a few sad moments but they\\'re easily forgotten when a monster that looks like it belongs in a haunted house shows up and gets in a 1-1 with imagine dragons playing the background. Also can we talk about that?? IMAGINE DRAGONS. LIKE 4 TIMES, it was surprising choice the first time but became a joke as it diluted the intensity of serious moments.Overall: The show isn\\'t bad, just not the most enthralling. The characters aren\\'t the most engaging other than the gangster and he says maybe a sentence an episode. I\\'d say watch the first few episodes and make a choice, hopefully the story gets more interesting if there\\'s a season 2.,I suppose that if you haven\\'t read the comic or the webtoon you\\'re will be quite lost watching this. Unfortunately this series is plagued by a bad script, empty annoying characters and ridiculous plot. The worst thing has to be the horrible music. Is this an action or a horror? Had hoped for the latter but the music destroys any atmosphere. Save your time.,Great acting. Good music. Good concept. Great special effects. Good characters. Good plot. Bad script.,The beginning of the show had me pretty hooked, but once I got towards the the last few episodes the dialogue, the characters, everything really just fell off for me. I almost just wanted it to end.,I would suggest you to watch all the episodes.. Worth Watching...,League of legends music in a supposedly scary scene. ruined,Me and my partner had been watching another excellent Korean Series Kingdom which also hangs in the balance of being renewed by Netflix and transitioning to this was a bit jarring at first. The characters were cartoony, the music at times (certainly in the first few episodes) seemed a little ill judged. As the season progresses however and certainly after epsiode 3 we started to become hooked and by the end we had a very much fully fledged set of dynamic characters. The slightly naff K-pop (Sorry if you\\'re a fan) had started to be toned down (by episode 3) and the ending to the series felt like you\\'d be taken on a real emotional ride with the comic book, almost Scott Pilgrim esque feel, had been completely eradicated. Funny, clever and some solid acting, I urge you to stick with it and you will be rewarded. Let\\'s hope Netflix do the sensible thing and bring it back for more.,First of all i\\'m one of those people who read the webtoon before seeing this .. For me it\\'s like Death Note all over again .. Cheap CGI, characters act stupid and all rude, pacing is all over the place, acting is subpar and music choice is god awful especially playing Warriors by Imagine Dragon in a fight scene that does not fit .. They\\'ve added and strayed far from the source material and make it look like a kid directed this series .. It is watchable but through out 10 episodes i just forced myself to finish it even if its so boring !!,I haven\\'t knew anything about the webtoon (still don\\'t), i just saw the Netflix trailer and thought i\\'d give it a go, since a like horror and korean movies.\\r\\nThe first 3 episodes were great for my taste (good atmosphere, setting and the monsters were awesome, especially their variety and quirks), the last 3 were great and the middle 4 episodes or so war a bit too slow, with nothing much happening in terms of action, which was a bit of a let down considering the first episodes set the expectations for me.\\r\\nOverall, really worth a watch, although i would\\'ve liked for the middle episodes keep up the tone of the first ones.,There are multiple scenes where anyone with a brain would realize that something is wrong, but they react so mind numbingly slow. Even when something obviously dangerous is right in front of them, there freeze for an unnaturally long time. I mean, sure, I know that some people freeze in dangerous situations, but they push it way beyond how normal people react. It is super annoying, and destroyed the whole immersion for me. I don\\'t care if it is intentional or bad acting. I simply couldn\\'t enjoy the show after realizing this, and stopped watching.,Just finished all 10 episodes!\\r\\nHonestly It wasn\\'t like Hollywood movies but it was really great and I really enjoyed it. The way all the emotions were shown was beautiful.\\r\\nGod! It\\'s true! Humans are scariest!!!,I read the Webtoon, and it was so tense and good, but the series isn\\'t as good as the Webtoon. So disappointed 🙁,Adam\\'s family movie is more terrifying than this miserable movieWhat is this south korea🙄🙄🙄,Thriller but with heartwarming aspects as well as humor. Can\\'t wait for season 2!,0.1/10!!\\r\\nThey tried, but totally failed.\\r\\nThe worst in 2020.,I\\'ve read the webtoon as well, and though there were aspects within the TV show differing from the original webtoon, I don\\'t really understand people who are hating on this show, saying that it\\'s too different. I found that the TV show had it\\'s own merits.,So I hadnt read the webtoon so I had no idea was it was going to be like. I don\\'t like non-english speaking shows either (I hate reading subs but then the mouth being out of timing and movement with the english dub is annoying) but honestly.. the first episode was weird and a lil terrifying at first but because it was a lil weird it made me want to watch the next episode.. few hours later I\\'ve completed the show and now I\\'m reading the webtoon.\\r\\nI had so many favourite characters (esp Pyeon Sang-wook <3) but it\\'s like TWD where you cant get too interested with a character because anything could happen. Although I hate when that happen, i also loved the storyline because you don\\'t know whether your fav character is about to die or not. The ending was good too but it 100% made a lot of viewers shed a tear.\\r\\nHope for a season 2!,The only two bad thing in this show is bad cgi and that warriors lol theme popping every badass scene happened every other thing is good and i really cant wait for season 2,Having read sweet home webtoon I was very excited to see it have its own drama. But the show has been utterly disappointing. The amount of liberties taken with the plot isn\\'t even funny. Besides first episode you can be totally certain this is something else. marketed as a hit webtoon but what you get is something else. Webtoon had a good plot progression and pacing, everything was explained nicely and you get to see very good amount of psychological struggle with inner monsters of mc which is totally missing in this series. This show feels more about feminism than anything else. Get a bunch of good looking girls and do plenty of action with them is what this show focused on. Important scenes to plot progression were totally ripped. Especially firefighter girl got more screen time and character development than mc! For god\\'s sake! You\\'re freaking ignoring mc just for sake of your ata girl marketing! I\\'m sorely disappointed in this show. Please do yourself a favor and read webtoon instead, it is really beautiful story. Oh! Forgot to mention, this series end on completely different note than webtoon so there might actually be a possibility of new season, but with their work in this I\\'m not watching next one. Webtoon does well to tie all loose ends and end the series on a good note. Also I\\'m mentioning this again, but firefighter girl totally ruined pacing of storyline. Her introduction to plot is forceful and meaningless to plot itself.,Very different, entertaining, more than just your typical zombie/survival show. Deeper meaning and great story behind it. Really enjoyed watching it and looking forward to the second season. Well done!,What\\'s wrong with those weak people who are looking at the brave one to die!!! Just for show their scare faces???,Amazing series zombies and monsters i love them and I think it\\'s great for people.,I didn\\'t read the manhwa and I\\'ve only checked it after watching all 10 eps. I prefer this series as they the main actors were good in their acting. The hook in wanting to know what happens next is also good. I recommend it,Not for kids, but a great show! Original and great fun to watch!,This delight gets really good after the standard setting up the character episodes. Really getting into Korean TV series and you will be mad to miss this. Great biohorror with a couple of surprises thrown in. Highly enjoyable,This series is so woahhh... I\\'m so speechless again and again,This is the serial killer Netflix that US series has hit on. Brilliant and fresh ideas !, Very amazing cast! I think this is a refresher on the series that\\'s all. Very worth watching !!.,I think it is well made. Acter did act very well. Monsters are also fine.,I have read the comic, I have read the webtoon .. and I have seen the drama ... it\\'s really great, I love how they have done everything, although there are always differences with the original comics, but ultimately it is a great version, all the actors , the scenes, the atmosphere, the music ... everything, a 10!It is entertaining from the beginning to the end, it leaves you wanting much more, I look forward to the second part!The best of Netflix this year !! I need more Asian live actions like this,It was really bad, disappointing. I don\\'t understand the hype,If you were looking foward to this and have read the webtoon I have to break it to you that its bad. The cgi is terrible the monsters are more comedic than scary the visuals are just bad in general, this concept and story was not meant for live action at all they should of just done a animation instead of live action the story is ok definitely not exactly the same as the webtoon of course. Netflix just needs to stop making live action series and films of good comics or animes it just does not work havent they learned this already I guess apparently not Just dont watch it not worth anyones time just read the webtoon or watch something else,I thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved the entire 10 eps, it was captivating. The first ep gave ma chill down my spine. The last ep was just too much for my heart. Specially when Hyun-su changes for real. I was like, Yes B***h that\\'s how you do it. That was the best. I can\\'t believe I cried too in a thriller-horror genre. But no regrets. The plot was well made and the acting was on point by each and ever character. Was happy to see a different side of Do Hyun. Song Kang, how the hell did you look handsome even after changing into monster is beyond me.,Monsters everywhere, Definitely watch.\\r\\nCharacters are insane.,Very entertaining, now I start reading the webtoon manga itself :),I seldom give reviews. But this one is worth watching if you enjoy watching zombie movies. Quite a lot of tense moments. Very entertaining and well scripted. I am looking forward to the next season.,Just finished all the ep. I spent two nights for this and really love it. I like all the way they created the monsters and the cast especially the high school boy Hyun Soo.,It is amazing.. This is the best zombie-monster drama or movie I\\'ve ever seen. Everything is so good including actors, the CGs, music and etc. I can give more than 10 rating if I can. I can\\'t wait for the season 2 and hopefully I can watch them soon.,-bad cgi and animation\\r\\n-some characters not like the original counterparts and they changed it so it\\'s not likeable as original\\r\\n-pacing suxgood stuff\\r\\n-main character potrayed lthe same way,Watched this in one day with my mom. We had a great time dissecting the character\\'s decisions and circumstances and both really loved the plot, f/x, and characters!,I heard that this is one of the biggest Netflix blockbuster this year with $2.4M each episode so i thought it\\'s gonna be some big thing, but turn out a mess.\\r\\nBad CGI, bad acting, bad soundtrack, the monsters look cheap and fake, it would make you laugh more than scare, and there is no depth in the content. It would be ok if this was just a random trash movie,... I am not expecting to see this from a big hyped project.,It was so freaking good.badly waiting for season 2 .,I read the webcomic as it came out, and have loved it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a Netflix adaptation, I was skeptical, but excited to see what they decide to do with it. If you\\'re like me, you\\'ll know that they changed a lot of things, drastically. The first complaint I have is how little we get to see Hyun. I feel like the comic focused on him a whole lot more, and we also got to see his \\'monster\\' way more frequently. The adaptation should\\'ve more on him than the rest of the group. On the other hand, I can see that if they focus on the group more, then it would strengthen the fact that Hyun is a loner, but I don\\'t exactly like that. The ending drastically changed, and I think it\\'s a hit or miss for most people. They added in the military and so many more things, but I liked the simplicity of the comic. Also, the girl with the character development (the one who fell to her death at the end) isn\\'t here, and it seems like she was replaced with another guy. Old man didn\\'t get crushed by protein monster (that was huge in the comic, I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t include that) and I think the romance is kinda bad. The woman and her dead child made me cry though, so I liked how they wrote her. Overall, I\\'m uncertain where they\\'ll take this, but I\\'ll keep my hopes up for now.,The story is really confusing and a lot of character just doing non sense. I know, horror movies usually are not logical in there action, but this show brings it to a new level. There are too many characters, which most of them are not really interesting to watch. There is a lot of CGI, but the quality is on b-movie level.\\r\\nIt feels like a string of random scenes.\\r\\n4/10 because they at least are trying to make something watchable.,I really wan\\'t sweet home season 2 PLEASE it\\'s an amazing drama it worth watch just WOW the cast is wonderful I CAN\\'T WAIT I WAN\\'T S2 RN,I loved everything after the first half of the first episode. The serie caught attention since the beginning with an amazing picture, actuations and a nice OST.All of the characters felt humand and had their own development, you get to know each of them and their back story.The only thing I disliked was the CGI but it\\'s something you can give the blind eye because the series is really good. I really hope if there\\'s a second season, they will make better this aspect. I can\\'t wait to see how this story will continue.,Story and script is boring. And wow!! Too much CGI super zombie with super powers going on. Characters are all boring,Absolutely fantastic, brilliant drama series. Looked forward to the release ever since the trailer came about. Binged watched in one day. It was so eye gripping and intense but field with the whole range of emotions. Brilliant actors, main actor did outstanding job also with his role in particular Cha Hyun Soo portrayed by Song Kang also the CGI was not bad, it was okay for what it was. Absolutely recommend this drama, and hope season 2 can be confirmed.,This is one of the worst tv series from Netflix.\\r\\nI was really looking forward to this, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment. Characters are boring and stupid. Bad CGI, Bad Soundtrack..etc. I think this drama likes random games.the script is very disjointed.This drama is like The Rain.,The show is quite good but sometimes falls flat on its face.I swear to god if I hear Warriors from Imagine Dragons one more time im going to lose it. As a matter of fact I have heard it so often during this show and in totally unfitting circumstanced I\\'m never going to hear Imagine Dragons again.,If you have read the webtoon version of this drama you might say \"THIS REALLY DESERVES A 10/10\". Over the past few months, Ive been binge reading this comic. And YES what you read is what you see in the adaptation. The monsters, plot the characters the flashbacks and emotions... It is really a YES for me. If yall are looking for a Train to busan like drama. Better watch this suspense bloody series 💜,I was lucky enough to stumble upon the Webtoon about 2 weeks before the final chapter, and not to be too harsh on the netflix adaptation but...As enjoyable as it was, the webtoon imo is a much more airtight and engaging story. It seems as if they want to make a second season to wrap up the story but the original did everything and more in around 150 chapters if i remember correctly. But regardless i\\'m very happy to see something like this get the attention it deserves. Regardless Carnby Kim is a god damn mastermind.,I could not stop watching until it was the end of the last episode. So much is not expected, which kept me on the edge of my seat. It\\'s a bit insulting to even compare this to anything in the zombie genre.It exciting, frightening, heart warming, and action packed.Wow! Please, please, please let there be a second season.,It is a nice drama. I watched in one sitting. Good entainment 10/10,The characters I like are aced, the characters I don\\'t like all survive. Is the scriptwriter work for the last of us 2?,An amazing survival thriller....want the second season ASAP!!!,The idea for this series is not bad at all, however the effects are pretty poorly and I think there is an overusage of the warriors which makes it kind of weird at some moments. It can be nice to watch, but it is definetly not great.,In my personal opinion, this series is worth watching, cause it\\'s a wonderful mixture of different feelings, if you look at the cover of the series, you\\'ll not expect that you will feel all these different feelings! The monsters in the series are professionally made!,The show is definitely worth the watch and it is not necessary to read the webtoon but it might answer questions you have about the story.\\r\\nThe CGI is nothing revolutionary but it is good nonetheless.A quality show with complex characters, an enjoyable story and visually pleasing scenes.I am satisfied with this adaptation of the webtoon, they did not stray too far from the source material and most scenes in the show are scenes in the webtoon. Good job with this one!I hope that we\\'ll be seeing a season 2 in the near future and that the quality remains on the same level or at a higher level than what we\\'ve seen with this current season.,There\\'s never a boring scene on this TV series. You really can\\'t turn away even for a sec. I love the soundtrack. Looking forward for a next season.,Its so great and worth watching some very cool monsters and again its worth every cent i think its better then alice in border land,It was a decent addition to Netflix. Majority of bad reviews is from webtoon freaks. It also provides a valuable lesson - All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to be grotesque.,Was expecting more but the movie plot was too cliche and the characters are all dumb in their own way. It\\'s like watching a comic.,This show has so many twists and turns it keeps you wanting more, I fell in love with this show!!! I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a show that keeps you wanting more!,I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this show. It\\'s apocalyptic settings, survival, monsters, mystery.... Camera, settings, actors, direction all are on very good level as expected from Korean cinema.,I\\'m sorry, but this isn\\'t good. Utterly disappointed given the praise it gets. There\\'s neither a captivating plot (rather repetitive, but could\\'ve been overlooked had this been character-driven), nor any kind of psychological analysis of emotions/feelings (at the point where people show unrealistically little fear when in dangerous situations), nor emphasis over the survival aspect of having the world end (like worrying about resources, social organisation etc.). It\\'s just a bit of everything that amounts to nothing interesting-no need for season 2 as there\\'s no need for season 1.,I was a little confused at first, but I stuck with it because of the acting. Everything about this show is amazing, the atmosphere, the character relationships, the pacing, everything, I\\'ve never cried so hard over a tv show. I fell in love with every character including the nasty ones. This is better than anything else Netflix has released. Definitely worth a watch. WELL DONE KOREA,This series was great! I would give it more stars if the last couple episodes didn\\'t seem so rushed... I\\'m stating to read the Webtoons it\\'s based on to make sense of it all and the Webtoons is way better hands down!,If I could give a negative rating, I would. Bad actors, bad plot and one of the worst CGI works. That sums it all, save your time.,Best apocalyptic show I\\'ve ever seen, can\\'t wait for season 2!!!!!!\\r\\nThe special effects are pretty good but you\\'ll definitly be staying for the insane atmosphere. Netflix please give us a season 2!,Please send this to sweet home director please put 2 season soso please 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏,Very good tv show\\r\\nbinge watched in one night\\r\\nvery interesting,First of all I loved the monster theme of it and how it\\'s not just like all the other zombie to show and movies. The episodes get really long tho and sometimes I just wanted to fast foreword. The monster are amazing and the characters are great and I really hope season two will come back! I hope there will be more monsters in the future and I hope there will be more characters too!,Don\\'t let the bad reviews stop you from watching this excellent series; watch the series and decide for yourself.\\r\\nI thought it was fantastic!\\r\\nI\\'d say it\\'s a cross between, The Mist Stephen King and the Japanese horror The Eye, with a selection of brilliant monsters of differing types, all excellently created and animated.\\r\\nThe dubbing was good with the characters voices well cast too.\\r\\nLove each character\\'s personalities, with a little humour thrown in for good measure, but not too much as to spoil the horror, gore and fear factor.\\r\\nI think it\\'s great that Netflix is bringing some excellent Eastern creativity to the West.\\r\\nI\\'d say thank you Netflix and well done to the creators.,If you are the type of person who don\\'t care much about plot, then feel free to watch it. But if you do, it\\'ll be a constant struggle and it\\'ll actually get worse with each episode. The pacing was also too fast and many things arent explained. Imagine Dragons is one of my fav band but the music placement is sometimes awkward. Overall I\\'ll prolly still finish watching it cuz my partner still enjoys it. But if it were up to me, I\\'d prolly stop less than midway.,One of the best things i have ever seen so far. i\\'m in love with every character in the show like how can it be possible loving all of the characters. it\\'s just.. wow...,Critics said that the music doesn\\'t match at all or that the storyline didn\\'t have any development. It\\'s like they only watched two episodes and made up their mind. I thought the music added so much to the experience that it was a whole experience on it\\'s own. And the story had so many layers that it actually touched me even after the show was over. I love the background they give on everyone and the twists and turns of the story. The visuals are insanely good and just how certain scenes were shot left me in awe. This was the first time I watched a dubbed show and gave it a try when before I would stay far from it. But this really changed my whole perspective and now I will give dubbed shows a chance. I can probably say this is my favorite show or at least top 3. Not only for it\\'s visuals but for how it left me thinking about the human struggles of the characters, especially the protagonist. Such a brilliant show. Everyone should watch it. I really hope there\\'s a season two and hope they could match how awesome season one was.,This show is amazing keep watching til the end, the cast did an amazing job,*First*\\r\\nMost of reviews here do not do justice to this show. The story is great, the character development is also compelling and really amazing CGI and visual effects.*Second*\\r\\nStory is gripping and it\\'s a roller coaster ride. This show will make you go through lots of emotions. This show gives me the anime *Parasyte* vibe.*Third*\\r\\nGive this show a chance and watch it all the way it\\'s a great one. Not in a single episode it felt like the show was dragging or was adding unnecessary fillers or anything unrelated to the story.,From the trailer i was unsure if I\\'d like the plot of the story but let me tell you the serie is phenomenal!!! It captiveted me from start to finish. Never throughout the story did i feel that it was boring and i wanted to skip a part like i usually do. 10/10 recommend you to give it a chance. It feels like the storyline was very well thought through. Might be because it\\'s based on a webtoon.If you generally don\\'t like horror movies you might still like the serie. It isn\\'t that scary. The is a lot of blood though.If you overcome your perhaps existing dislike of movies with subtitles i\\'m sure you will be pleasantly surprised with how good it is:),I can\\'t wait for a second season. I have a lot of unanswered questions and I can\\'t wait to see what\\'s going to happen next!,The world-building and the characters are excellent. I love every role that is in the series. They did a great job. The story itself is nice although, I am not a fan of what happened in the last part. You can say that there will be a Season 2 for this. It is a super cliff-hanger, or maybe I am only hoping for a happy ending for this?I love the scene when Hyun Su totally became a monster, and the Uncle character that made their weapons hugged him to calm Hyun Su. I really thought it would be one of the cures for special-infected monsters. Some more confusions and answers are not yet resolved, so Season 2 is an excellent way to wrap it up.I hate that Lee Do Hyun\\'s character died :(((( He\\'s one of the reasons why there are survivors, yet he didn\\'t survive. I hope he\\'ll also appear if ever there\\'s a Season 2.Overall, I loved it despite its flaws. I am looking forward to series like this one.,I couldn\\'t feel tension at all. Music didn\\'t fit with some scenes. Disappointing, i put high expectation after reading the comic.,Everything was fine but not as expected. They show love between the characters I thought there will be at least one kissing scene. But I was wrong.,I shared it. The plot is so great. I have to particularly commend Song Kang\\'s acting. His inward feelings are wonderful. I just love it.Can\\'t wait for the season 2.,Good show with fascinating plot,however the graphic is terrible. The monsters look like they come from an animation which decreases the terror of the movie. Even in some thriller scenes,I don\\'t feel any fright.,To say it was painfully bad is an understatement. No plot, no script, no meaningful dialogue, I wish I could get back the time I spent watching this.,I rly liked the first 2 episodes, but as the series progressed it got worse and worse.The actors behave and have mimics as if just graduated, or this was their first acting.Then there is this bad story telling...\\r\\nI hated all that stupid charatcter vs character interaction in Walking Dead, this is even more bs.,Is this a joke????? This series was like a failed animation movie with \"actors\" who forgot their role. The so called human monsters were literally just cartoon animation like Garfield or shrek....!Honestly what the hell was that??? This series is just as bad as the MIST series. The \"actrors\" were so baaaaad !!! Oh my God they were supposed to be scared but the scare feeling wasn\\'t just there. \"Actors\" were intentionally stupid and pretending to shake in fear you could tell. Honestly I\\'ve never been so disappointed in a Korean series like this. Its so sad to watch. Sorry but that\\'s my opinion I hate it.,The first episode, Lee Eun-Yoo\\'s ballet shoes dangling and the angle created from the inside was amazing! They created such beautiful cinematic angles that I couldn\\'t believe it.,The series is emotionally a little low, there is only love in 3 characters, but in general, every part is extremely good and fun, there are no empty monsters, new monsters, new features are coming in all sections, you definitely won\\'t regret watching the 2nd season, I recommend a great series :),It\\'s Good(Webtoon was awesome great) that there are extra characters introduce in the flix version all Good , Actors were good also but I hope you don\\'t change the Relationship of the characters as you See Ji su was the one in Webtoon to bring Hyunsu to human form when struggle with his monster form however in this Series version there was soo less value given to Jisu it looked more like she is just one of the other survivor fighting for the surviving, which highly is not acceptable.,It can be good, but they ruin it, too many cuts, so people who never read the webtoon won\\'t understand.,Stupid scripts and dumbest directions...\\r\\nIt\\'s just wasting money.\\r\\nNever watch it!,Really enjoyed this series. Loved the concept of humans turning into monsters.,Dont care about the Bad ratings, take a view of this Series on your Own, its absolute beyond awesome in my opinion because i like Asian series and Movies a lot 💪🏼 The Bad Raster dont know what they Talking about 😌,Worst TV series ever. Maybe 1st episode is fine, but other episodes are horrible, it\\'s not worth to watch. Story snd shots continuity are hard to understand. And bad CG is distracting alot. We don\\'t have time watch this in our life.,BEST SHOW EVER IN EVERYTHING 🔥🔥!!!Please let be season two :(!!!!,Almost the same as the WEBTOON and everything they had to change worked. 10/10 need to watch,I watched the first episode at very late night and it was perfect to make me sleepy since I got bored for poor scripts, bad actors and lack of good drama.\\r\\nI normally like Korean shows from others I watched in Netflix, but this one feel like they gave the control to bunch of adults with zero experience on filming and they had money to waste on something,Alright survival plot but they had to keep it \"true Korean\" and priorities dramatization over sense and continuity. Especially at the last couple of episodes, which made the whole show feels alot cheaper than it actually is. I lost all interest in the action scene because of this. It had me invested enough to not give up, though. I just skipped over the nonsense drama and floated through the dumb action part to get to the ending, mostly so it wouldn\\'t have been a total waste of time. It\\'s definitely acceptable entertainment during lockdown but don\\'t expect any any more than that.,Seems like a cool premise, but the special effects are so bad it\\'s laughable. Basically a mix of 90\\'s CGI and 60\\'s stop motion photography. I couldn\\'t get past episode 2.,First half of this series was great, towards the end it got worse, slowly less and less monsters, weird plot gaps... even the soundtrack changed direction.,This show starts off strong as a horror drama, but devolves into a silly comedy in the later episodes. For example, there are ridiculously inopportune and overused upbeat rock music and pop music playing during what supposedly seems like horror or tragic moments. There are also recycled cliched (Hollywood esque) tropes of a white collar worker playing out his samurai fantasies of swinging a katana and taking on monsters, main characters surviving what would normally be fatal injuries for no reason other than plot armor, people getting rescued at the last minute, and other cliched hero saves the day from monsters tropes. This show had a lot of potential nut seems to waste it in the later episodes.,Idk what to say\\r\\ni had really high expectations , great cast , amazing webtoon ,\\r\\nif anyone read the webtoon they will get me\\r\\ni felt like watching that bad movie \"adaptation\" of deathnote. :(\\r\\nthat was so poorly done ,\\r\\nthe graphics/cgi was bad ,\\r\\nthe acting was so lame ,\\r\\neventhough it has a great cast all of them in previous performances r gr8 !\\r\\ntbh i don\\'t recomend this at all\\r\\nread the webtoon bttr .,This movie is perfect nothing to coment is perfect wait for sezon 2.,\"Gangster\" was my frav character.... could have done so much more with him....but overall worth a watch,I had the series in my to watch list for a while, but I honestly didn\\'t feel like watching something meh. When I saw the most recent reviews and their positive reaction, I decide to give it a chance. Started it with low expectations, but was completely drawn in after the first episode. I couldn\\'t stop watching and watched the entire season in two days. I am still mind blown, hence writing my first review. It was so fun to watch, the story was an original twist on a doomsday scenario and I caught myself getting attached to characters that I usually don\\'t care about. And I love that they didn\\'t feel compelled to keep all the main characters alive. The backstory might be a little hard to swallow if you are not used to watching asian movies/series, however for me it did not take away from the main story too much. There were a few flaws here and there, but it actually gave the series character.\\r\\nI absolutely hope season 2 will come and I also hope it will be as good.,Sweet Home is nothing what I expected it to be. This got me holding on to the edge of my seat from the 1st episode until the last. The only real complaint I have is that it ended! Sure hope that this thriller of a show comes back for many more seasons. I thought Sweet Home was going to be a Zombie thriller but... Way more.\\r\\nLoved it!,It\\'s not scary so don\\'t expect it to be a horror series it\\'s more of a thriller. I absolutely loved watching it and I can\\'t wait for season 2. People who call this boring especially from just the first episode, Are you even watching the same thing as us fans? Lol the first episode was AMAZING and full of tension. Though things do quite down at the middle of the season but they pick up the pace again near the end, so it\\'s totally worth watching. Question is now, where can find something else that\\'s equally awesome?!!! 😆,Recommended I wanted to see more the series is very good,counting the days for season 2,If you were to take every 90\\'s classic horror game, an 80\\'s B horror movie that is so bad it\\'s good, have it made in Korea, and turn it into a TV show this would be the outcome.Watched the first episode, and it\\'s so bad but can\\'t seem to stop watching it.If someone turned this into a video game I would buy it.,Its realy like walking dead, human is the true monster, but overall i like the way the series approach, the character well developed and how our emotion take control, how we subdue our emotion, our desire, and how we as human act when trouble came.,A brilliant and we\\'ll written script, with mostly original monsters. You get to feel for the characters throughout, and the way they care for each other and overcome challenges is a treat to watch. Highly recommended!,I watched episode 1 and can\\'t even finish the episode 2.. it has a lot of potential but wasted.. poor direction and execution of the story..,I watched this whole series in 1 day, less than 24 hours. This is too good and I totally recommend. Do watch. Can\\'t wait for season 2.,OK, I am going to start by saying that I\\'m a huge horror fan so this series really caught my attention. From start to finish it was a Rollercoaster of creepiness, scares, emotions and awesome character development. Never got boring for even a second and the monsters are really cool and deep if you are paying good attention to the story. Most monsters in horror movies don\\'t even make much sense but in this series it does make sense. Because I got pretty tired of horror movies with the classic its just a bunch of meaningless jumpscares and enemies that are just there to fill the plot. No more blubbering. Go watch this series right now and you won\\'t regret it. Excited for season 2 and what is has to offer! (Also I had to give it 9/10, - 1 because of some fight scenes being a little rushed. But still, a series definitely worth watching!),People who gave 1 point should finish the show. Honestly, at first I did not understand the subject because I haven\\'t read the webtoon. I continued watching and the show really amazed me. It made me think about every single person\\'s unknown inner world. One episode I hated one character and I was like die right now you are so annoying. In the other I cried for that character and prayed for him/her not to die. I loved watching them become a family. Character developments, understanding all of the characters\\' inner worlds step by step was amazing. In the beginning there was scenes about past and they are confusing I agree but you\\'ll see that they are puzzle pieces and in the end they would complete the puzzle.,Huge plot holes. The characters are so boring, insanely dumb and follow absolutely every cliche possible.,The suspense at the end was great. Should get a second season. The series built the story quickly. This could have been more subtle. It held all the stories together but we\\'re a bit here n there. The actors were great. Could get their feeling from their expressions. Please end the series don\\'t drop it in between.,If you\\'ve read the Webtoon, you will be disappointed. I was so excited for this adaptation to come out, but I can\\'t believe they took great IP and did this. The original comic is subdued and spooky in how banal it seems until monsters appear. But this show rushes through character introductions and has a really garish lighting scheme and Party City mask monsters. It looks like an 80s B movie, so if you\\'re into that this might be for you but has none of the original horror. Moreover, it\\'s a tonal nightmare with a random Imagine Dragons\\' song used as a recurring theme. The flashbacks extrapolate too much of Hyun\\'s character arc in the first episodes which ruins a lot of the mystery about his character. If you choose to watch this and haven\\'t read the Webtoon, I would advise you to check it out to see how good this could\\'ve been!,Disclaimer: have watched only two episodes. I think \"Sweet Home,\" the apartment building where the story unfolds, is the actual star of the series. The details are amazing.,Atmosphere of the series is one of a kind in comparison with many horror series that I have seen before. It\\'s giving the audience entire. At the beginning, the series has really good pace in building the environment. It shows the empathy between humans are significantly important in this world. However the appearance of the monster is reduced, the series introduces new enemies. It throw off the balance of the movie and the dialogue are made unnaturally.,I feel bad for the actors. They really did their best. The directing, however, is absolutely horrendous.The pacing is horrible it seems as if they were trying to finish everything in one season, but were running out of time and then towards the end started upping the pace until it\\'s impossible to follow what is going on. There are sudden shifts in pace and scenes seem completely disconnected. Lots of important plot points are completely skipped. It makes a lot of the important parts of the story seem unimportant and skips all of the struggles that helped build characterization.The plot diverges heavily from the original webtoon, as if someone explained the main plot points to them from a moving car and they did their best to reconstruct some context for the show. New characters are introduced which steal roles from existing characters which results in poor characterization and character development for them all. The main character is tossed to the wayside and they barely show his progress. Many new characters are introduced whose only purpose are to drive your blood pressure up and be irritating; Hyun-soo\\'s younger sister is rude and disgusting to everyone, the side characters who live in the apartment do literally nothing but cry, get in the way, cower in a corner when someone strong shows up, and throw a hissy fit when things don\\'t go their way. They contribute literally nothing.Bass girl has her role completely cannibalized and her roles given to the firefighter girl. She ends up being a minor character and spends most of the show being sad about her dead lover, and suddenly having appendicitis and needing surgery which is performed without anesthetics.Later when the prisoners show up, they spend time building up the leader who then immediately gets killed in an unimpressive way. The guy with similar powers to the main character randomly starts killing half the charactersIn the end all of the actual characters of importance are dead, so when they get captured and the firefighter (only iportant character left) turns on them, I felt no remorse.Also, monsters show up and cause issues in maybe 3 or 4 episodes. They aren\\'t nearly as dangerous or scary as in the webtoon, and don\\'t actually do anything. After going into the basement they only find one monster. Once they start fighting, only then do they see that there\\'s actually tons of them, and they start using car beeps from pressing buttons on the keys to distract a monster. But they didn\\'t show them collecting the keys or planning to do this so it seems completely out of place. Not too long after them driving through the basement and crashing, it cuts to another scene upstairs and the next episode they mention the basement is clear and from that point on it\\'s clear, but they never show them killing the monsters. Then, they don\\'t them planning or preparing to make it but they make a armored car pouring tons of resources into it, and drive it out and it immediately gets destroyed by the protein monster. This happens in a cutscene taking like 20 seconds.The series is full of decisions like this that ruin the flow and make it confusing. It doesn\\'t make it fun to watch for someone who hasn\\'t already read the webtoon. And if you have read it, you would be confused why they changed things so much and destroyed any storytelling. That just begs the question. Who is this for?,You want to see a good kdrama. This is not for you. Cheap soundtrack and graphics with a very bad cinematography makes this series an utter waste. The sound track feels as if I am hearing a bollywood action movie soundtrack. It was the worst of the worst. Never see this.,I just wanna say Thank-you. It\\'s just awesome. I want season 2 asap.,I laughed to myself a little at the review that said the episodes \"fell off\" a bit after the first few, the reason being that they weren\\'t being dazzled by the mutating beings anymore and had to use cognitive skills and follow a story. On the other hand, if there wasn\\'t a story, then we would have the other half of the crowd whining and moaning that there was no story, just brutes in all fashions fighting non stop, which is great for some story, but, I want to be on the edge of my seat for real things, I want to watch people struggle as they see signs of their own infection. I want to see people turn on each other and likewise fight for one another as they see people they have come to care about become infected. This show was SO much fun, it doesn\\'t follow the same recipe of, destroy the head, destroy the being, one bite turns you etc. That\\' was SO refreshing, THIS is why I love watching Korean and Chinese dramas, I find more unique stories. Sure, there are tropes to be seen, but it\\'s not always the same over and over and this show is a great example. I am blown away that the ratings aren\\'t higher on this series. How tf does the walking dead have a higher score than this? I like the walking dead, I watched it, but, it\\'s certainly not unique and certainly not better than this.,This id consider an original so far got all different kind of monsters but yet it still has to do with a virus....i like the fact they took virus zombie to mutating monsters lookin like theyd be coming up from the bottom of hell instead... not really a zombie show id say but i love it,I actually read the webtoon after watch the trailer of this series. It\\'s so good that i couldn\\'t stop reading until finish. Therefore, the high expectation to this netflix adaptation. It only took 1 episode to make me sum up that this is very bad. I know cinema and still graphics are different media, but this is just too far. I can imagine that if i haven\\'t read the webtoon, I wouldn\\'t finish the first episode. Bad CGI (the monsters are not scary at all and more like stop motion dolls), very bad acting and directing. And yeah, the background music is very annoying. I did fast forwarding through episode 1-9, and found that they even changed the story into the cheesy one, and again with bad acting., A real surprise\\r\\n, Good effects but lacking emotional connection\\r\\n, The series was a 10/10 through 4-5 episodes and then 3/10 the last 5\\r\\n, Good Enough\\r\\n, Mayhem & Monsters\\r\\n, Pepperoni & Sausage Nightmare\\r\\n, I expected more\\r\\n, Lots of Staring\\r\\n, Korean Drama outmatches again.\\r\\n, Humans have failed\\r\\n, Addicting story, horrible execution\\r\\n, Worth watching, but not for casual viewers\\r\\n, If this was a show from the US.\\r\\n, Worth it if you want to watch something insane\\r\\n, Gory and firmly in the horror genre\\r\\n, so bad\\r\\n, Stupid and pointless\\r\\n, Decent, could\\'ve been so much better.
