0,Squid Game,"Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably don't need me to give you this warning. ""Squid Game"" is one of the most incredibly violent things you can watch and it's NOT something you want to let your kids see. And, if your mother or Father O'Reilly drop by, you also might want to think twice before watching this South Korean mini-series with them! You'll see hundreds dies, heads explode and tons of blood....just don't say I didn't warn you!In many ways, the show is a lot like the Japanese movie ""Battle Royale"" or the ""Hunger Games"" films...but with one huge exception. Unless the unwilling participants in the other films, the folks in ""Squid Game"" know what they're in for after the first round...and their deaths were because of their greed or situation in life.The film begins by showing you a bit of Seong Gi-hun's life. He (Lee Jung-jae) is a loser in pretty much every way and his gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage. He's deeply in debt to loan sharks who vow to kill him and you have a very hard time feeling sorry for the guy. He's ruined his, his wife's and his daughter's lives.When one of his loan sharks catches up to him, you assume they'll either beat Seong or kill him. Oddly, however, instead they have him sign a paper in blood....and in order to avoid being killed he signs it without hesitation. What he doesn't realize is that by doing this, he's agreed to enter one of the strangest gambling contests ever...if not the strangest.Seong arrives at the location the paper tells him to go to...but why, he isn't sure. Soon a van pulls up and he enters...and is knocked out almost immediately. When he awakens, he's with 455 other participants...who, at this point, have no idea what they're in for with these strangely clad 'hosts'. They are told they're playing a game of Red Light/Green Light...and most of the folks think it's all very childish. However, when the first one moves when it's a red light, snipers kill him!!! Soon, they realize that they'd BETTER make it to the goal line before the allotted time or they'll die...and die many of them do.After this 'game', about 200 of them were killed. But here's where it gets interesting. They are then allowed to vote as to whether to finish the game and go home or continue. By only one vote, they vote to go home. Episode two shows them at home...and it's my favorite one of the shows in the series. At this point, most of the remaining players actually decide to return to the game, as many of them face death or prison if they quit the game. The final seven episodes are the continuation of the game...as well as showing the actions of a cop who manages to infiltrate the contest.Again, just to make things clear, this is a mega-violent show....even more so than the ""Fargo"" television series! But I kept watching despite this because the writing was simply exquisite and the characters in the game truly memorable...and in some cases, infamous. It also is exceptional because so much of it is hard to predict! Overall, a film that is different enough from ""Hunger Games"" and ""Battle Royale"" that it really works well. I found it so compelling, I watched the entire series in one evening....though I'd only planned on seeing and episode or two.By the way, if you care, the amount won in the contest is a bit more than $38,000,000 US dollars."
1,Squid Game,"Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too."
2,Squid Game,"Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!"
3,Squid Game,"Mixed feelings on this one. The glorification of violence in shows like this tend to be desensitizing and seem to acclimate those with criminal tendencies to head down a wrong path. Yet the challenge of the individual games create a paradox of situations in which the viewer is steered toward thinking that certain players will work together, only to find they are pitted against each other, as in the marble game. The horror of that game was brought forth when a married couple naively decided to work together, only to be faced with the grim reality that there could only be one survivor. These kinds of situations were prevalent throughout the series episodes, making it almost impossible to know who would survive at the final outcome. Through it all, I believed there was something noteworthy about the old man, player #1 (Hideo Kimura), who's physical resemblance to an aged Korean Billy Crystal impinged on my brain every time I saw him (go back and see what I mean). Oddly, for such a large cast of characters, there weren't any that I could really connect with in a meaningful way. Perhaps the closest was player #240, young Ji-yeong (Vivian Lu, incorrectly identified in the credits as Sae-Byeok), eliminated in play when partnered with player #67 Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Hoyeon). Tied for most despicable characters were player #101 Deok-su (Paul Nakauchi) and player #212 Han Mi-neo (Stephanie Komure), so it was appropriate that they should be eliminated together in the Glass Stepping Stones game. The ending here seemed a little superfluous considering all that went before, with the old man Il-nam wagering a final personal bet against Gi-hun (Greg Chun), player #456, and winner of the grand prize of 45.6 billion won. Doing the conversion, that came to just under thirty nine million dollars, and seeing all those big numbers can really disorient the viewer. When Gi-hun paid the flower vendor at the end of the story a ten thousand won note for a single bunch, it seemed awful generous, until doing the math revealed it was about eight dollars and fifty cents."
4,Squid Game,"Even if you've seen ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Money Heist"", ""Squid Game"" (called ""Ojing-eo Geim"" in the original Korean) is still going to shock you. The sad thing is that so many people have no other choice but to risk everything like the characters here.Definitely see it. You'll never look at any children's game the same way again after seeing it."
5,Squid Game,"This runaway hit from South Korea is centred on Seong Gi-hun, a heavily indebted man who is invited to take part in a series of six games that if he wins will solve his problems. He accepts gets into a vehicle where a gas puts him to sleep. When he wakes he is in a large facility with over four hundred other people; they are watched over by masked armed guards. Here they are told the rules, one of which states that if a majority of players want to quit the game will end but they will not get any prize money. As they play the first game, the school yard game 'red light green light' they quickly learn that being eliminated is quite literal with losers being shot on the spot! Over the course of the series Gi-hun gets to know various other contestants; some he befriends and forms a team with for certain games; others are quickly identified as a danger. As the games continue more and more people are eliminated. While this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.When I saw this recommended on Netflix I thought I'd watch it sometime but was in no great rush as I assumed to would be a Korean 'Alice in Borderland'. After hearing talk of its popularity I thought perhaps I should watch it sooner. I'm glad that I did. I really liked 'Alice in Borderland' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. The games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. The characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. The programme's design is impressive; I especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. The cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles."
6,Squid Game,"Everybody has been talking about ""Squid Game."" I've been seeing memes and costumes, and I was in the dark. I didn't feel compelled to watch it at all because I generally don't watch T. V. shows. I found that any show can make one or two good episodes, but then I begin disliking every character after a while. I broke down and watched ""Squid Game"" at the constant urging of my wife and to me it's meh.To me it's a Korean ""Hunger Games."" I know that there are some big differences, but it's still people playing deadly games for a prize. What has drawn in so many viewers is the fact that adults are playing kids games with deadly consequences. Of course, there has to be some exposition and character development in a nine episode show with each ep being an hour, but what we're all there to see is who will survive and who will be eliminated. Like those who go to NASCAR races for the crash.Maybe it's a victim of its own hype, but I wasn't that impressed. There were some impressive moments such as the first game they played and the pure shock of it all, and maybe even episode six when choosing partners put them in a position many of them didn't want to be in, but I will say that some of the 'umph' is taken out of a show when you know that anyone without a significant speaking role is definitely dying before any main character. I've labeled this spoiler so I'll say this: when you have a tug-o-war game with just about every main character on one team it's a dead giveaway that they're going to win no matter how weak and frail they look.So, to ""Squid Game"" I say ""Meh."" Only one character was halfway exciting or fun to watch and the side stories didn't interest me enough. If ""Squid Game"" were four episodes instead of nine I think it would've been a lot better. That being said, I'm committed now. I would like to see what happens in season two."
7,Squid Game,Exciting show that keeps you watching. The Korean part is the emotional connection with the characters and their financial problems and how they have family obligations. The violence although comically exaggerated is unusual for a K drama. Good acting from LSJ and PHS veteran actors. Striking set design gives it a visually glossy look. Whatever makes international audiences watch K dramas is good. This isn't a typical K drama and far from one of the best. But it's a swift watch.
8,Squid Game,"I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next."
9,Squid Game,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSEASON ONESeong (Lee Jung-Jae) is down on his luck, addicted to gambling and in debt to vicious loan sharks, not to mention eager to reacquaint with his estranged son. At his lowest ebb, he finds himself approached by a man at a train station, who offers to take care of his financial woes if he agrees to participate in a secretive ritual. With no choice but to accept, Seong finds himself plunged, with a group of others, in to a nightmarish, garish battle for survival.Korean cinema has enjoyed some recent worldwide acclaim, with cult hits such as Parasite and The Platform leaving quite an impression. But this year it's enjoyed this again in a TV format, with this mind-bending visceral blow from writer/director Hwang Dong-hyuk. It's sheer outrageousness and visual astonishment is enough to leave an impression, and even sparked some copycat behaviour around the world, with reports of people reenacting some of the 'games' portrayed.It comes together like a fusion, of the wildest excesses of the most fantastical Phillip K Dick novel, and the most blood thirsty Quentin Tarantino film, with a fairly standard format of a group of strangers being thrown together to fight for survival, which has been portrayed in films such as Cube. Like the aforementioned films, there seems to be some societal commentary thrown in, such as increasing poverty and the gap between rich and poor, as well as the depths 'reality TV' could sink to in the name of 'entertainment.'It's definitely been the runaway hit of 2021, that's left quite an impression, and gained quite a cult status, that, in spite of its excessive gruesomeness, can safely be said to be earned. ****"
10,Squid Game,I loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe.
11,Squid Game,"This series is so overrated. But let's be fair, it's a very good series. I've watched a few movies about it. The script was good. Acting was sometimes exaggerated, maybe it's a cultural thing. I did not like the final part. Overall very well done. In the final episode, my expectation was different. But the final scene was disappointing. Season 2 will come, I hope it doesn't fall into ""La Casa De Papel"" status."
12,Squid Game,"I honestly don't know wtf the main character needed to go into the room where the old man was, dye his hair red and not attempting to board the plane. At the beginning I was having expectations that it would be thrillingly good which it was but the ending just didn't do it for me chief...."
13,Squid Game,It's good because it was on Netflix and everyone who sawed this show also liked it.A show that exceeded expectations because it was so good and had wicked scenes.Oh man. I loved this show very much. The acting and premise was a Glorified excellence.Please watch squid game. Haha. Seriously. It's so good because it was on Netflix.
14,Squid Game,"Greetings from Lithuania.I liked and enjoyed ""Squid Game"" (2021) series for its interesting and simple concept which at the end of the day was very solidly executed. Acting was very solid, as well as directing and writing. The whole concept felt fresh and kinda original and it was easy to get attached and watch the whole show. Ending was also pretty interesting, although a bit predictable.Overall, i enjoyed ""Squid Game"". It felt fresh and was involving as well being believable throughout. I believe that given its popularity it will get more seasons. As long as they will be solid as the first one, I'm in for this show."
15,Squid Game,"Squid Games (2021) is a series my wife and I recently watched on Netflix. The storyline follows people who choose to play child's games competitively for money that could change their life forever. Shortly after they arrive they discover the price for losing is rather expensive. This series was directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk (The Fortes and My Father) and stars Lee Jung-jae (New World), Park Hae-soo (Time to Hunt), Oh Yeong-su (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring) and Jung Hoyeon (100%: Beat). The storyline for this series is very unique and was a creative spin on similar films like Battle Royale, Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies. The concepts were well thought-out and paced and the characters are very well developed. The storyline and characters evolve well throughout the series. The games and settings are amazing and they used great colors and cinematography to present each scenario. The costumes and props were obviously outstanding as well. My one complaint was the main character who was painfully annoying throughout the series and completely ruined the end for me. The gore and kill scenes in this are unique and very well done. I'd score this series a 7.5/10 and would consider it an absolutely must see."
16,Squid Game,"I recently got into Netflix again I take breaks and use other services glad I finally decided to watch this whacky series! Probably get hate for this but I watch the English dub version cause I don't do well with subtitles still lovable show. The music, flow of everything, absurdity, and story is all excellent!"
17,Squid Game,"Squid Game is no show that hit me that much - I watched a couple of episodes and was rather bored, I would prefer to watch some real MMA fights - more excitement and action going on, and less drama. The first episode dragged on and on and on till the first real action. The second episode was a rather redundant detour of the story. The idea or concept is also nothing really new: Stephen King aka Richard Bachman, The Long Walk and The Running Man, or movies like Battle Royal, The Hunger Games, Death Race, Circle, Cube or 13 and many more precede Squid Game. So what's left? Some nice ideas (the games), some solid action and a sip of blood, but with too much uninteresting filler time. Summa summarum: Not that bad but rather just another hype, just my few cents of course."
18,Squid Game,"Korean Drama ""Squid Game"" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful.It has a nice cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action scenes. The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more 'Korean Drama' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 7 out of 10."
19,Squid Game,"Creator and director Dong-hyuk Hwang certainly had one crazy vision, and successfully made a series of it. Sure it has plot and technical issues, and I wasn't fond of the ending - I re-wrote it in my head much better, but for a somewhat newb Korean filmmaker, this was epic.The visuals, props and sets were outstanding. The cinematography and score amazing. The casting and performances by all, except the VIP's, was excellent. Props to Neflix once again, and thanks for dubbing this one right this time. Hoping for a S2 real soon. A well deserved 8/10 from me."
20,Squid Game,"This is another version of The Hunger Games. Contestants are killed without knowing there is a death result from Green Light, Red Light. The majority choose to leave so they go. However a lot come back for the second contest, willingly.The contestants play against each other in a survival of the fittest contest. They play Korean children games, killing each other.If your ""friend"" was going against you for money, would they kill you?"
21,Squid Game,"Ep1 wonderful drama that we love, protagonist of dubious character, we didn't even root for him, but I loved his rambunctious behavior, Chips 1, 2, 3, bizarre in the way we love... T2 more drama than blood, we love it too... Ep4 Loving the jokes of macabre and bloodthirsty children, catching love for the characters, and hatred for the villains...
Ep 6 the construction of the characters was perfect, the games give a sarcastic and sadistic tone, however the dialogues are the high point, with that black humor that the Koreans do so well, the conversations between the characters are intelligent, with a quick script, everything very captivating and mesmerizing, the players and the undercover cop, showing the other side of the game... Lovely..
Ep 6 And the marbles game brought me a few tears, this was the game where the most innocent characters die, like the Pakistani who just wanted money to help his family who stayed there, his naivety and trust cost him his life , and the girl who killed the father who will kill her mother, and who has just got out of prison, and in the end gives up the game for her partner, perfect scenarios...
I finished Round 6, completely in love, I already loved Korean movies, it just came to reaffirm their competence, perfect, everything perfect, I loved the dialogues, super mesmerizing script, the perfect effects, everything great in this production, I even cried... Beautiful, beautiful... But I saw many truths there, in real life it would be more or less like this..."
22,Squid Game,"A group of desperate people agree to play high-stakes children's games, and then find how high the stakes really are. The show is an odd mix of nonsense and excellence. The premise is interesting but the ultimate revelation about the games and their founder is simplistic and does little explain the provenance of the vast, complex yet secret game venue. There are some hints at secondary plotlines but they go nowhere and the introduction of wealthy gamblers is a heavy-handed social-commentary that adds nothing to the story (and leads to the weakest moments in the series). The acting and characters are excellent and the dark shifts in their motives and ethics as more and more players are 'eliminated' is expertly done (episode 6, ""Gganbu"" is a highlight). The imagery, especially the creepy geometric enforcers, the 'play grounds' and the multicolored stairs that look like something from an Escher etching is memorable (and may be what really sets 'Squid Game' apart from similar 'deadly games' series). The film is quite violent, both in a cartoony way and in a more visceral 'realistic' and disturbing way. Not to everyone's' taste but entertaining and compelling."
23,Squid Game,"A superbly and psychologically deep series that you watch, finish and ponder upon. Just loved the old man with his super charismatic aura and beautiful witty smile.The season's ending is a little ambiguous and as some reviewers mentioned, I too, like it to finish as it is and not come back with a second season that wouldn't do real justice to the S-Korean cinematic culture.They produce, they film and they finish. They do not come back repeatedly..."
24,Squid Game,"A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American). They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained."
25,Squid Game,"The usage of children games in an adult world is catchy, but the realism behind all this is somewhat shaky - South Korea is no ""Wild West"" and one can hardly think of events like this happening there, with so large body count... The idea of fierce contests with elimination has been utilised before, plus it is hard to maintain a thrill when there are leading performers from the beginning apparently not dying before the end...Underplots are not too elaborate and they tend to ""mince"" the main plot. Luckily, this anti-capitalist idea is not overhanging too much. The number of episodes could be less, but some good twists in the final one elevated the thrill that began to fade away in e.g. Episodes 7 and 8.However, the performances are interesting, so different for the Western ones, how they react and how they depict, with men more versatile though. Lee Jung-jae and O Yeong-su were most to my liking, the latter providing a nice twist towards the end as well...Season 2 might be underway - based on the ending scenes... I would probably watch it as well. But not impatient though."
26,Squid Game,"The South Korean nine-episode ""survival"" action/drama series ""Squid Game,"" which debuted on Netflix in September of 2021 to international acclaim, is just the latest in a long series of TV shows being imported from Asia that are action-packed, emotionally engaging, and extremely & brutally violent. ""Squid Game,"" which takes its title from a Korean children's game, revolves around people from all over South Korea, all of whom are in terrible financial debt, who risk their lives to participate in a series of deadly contests that are based on children's games. If they survive all six games over a six-day period, they'll walk away with a whopping 45.6-billion won (roughly, a little over $38.5 million in U. S. currency) cash prize.So far, the ending of the first episode has me hooked. Let's see where things go from here...9/10."
27,Squid Game,A tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses. Combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to.
28,Squid Game,"I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it's nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the ""kill game"" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera."
29,Squid Game,"Yeah, this series is pretty awesome but I don't think it needed another season. And that is the problem, you can feel them stretching out for another season. Greed killed this series for me and nothing else."
30,Squid Game,Entertaining and demonstrating human nature via this drama. My conclusion is not to be poor otherwise become a chess from rich.
31,Squid Game,"One of the most beautiful series I've ever seen, finished in a few days one episode led to another and the desire to follow the series increases more and more. The tension is built very well game by game and the main characters are really well developed."
32,Squid Game,"I found Squid Game a hard show to put down. Once you immerse yourself within this show it feels all too real and scary. I find dark shows more engrossing perhaps because they seem realistic and possible. Human nature has a dark and sometimes unforgiving side. This is why shows like Squid game and Black Mirror trend compared to very PG and convenient shows where the good guys always win.Another thing to celebrate here is diversity and globalisation. Squid game, being a Korean show which is set in Korea with Korean actors has broken viewing records. The power of Netflix, through its streaming, has crossed international boundaries and reached so many people. We didn't need to see big Hollywood names or familiar settings in New York or LA. Korea and its brand of actors delivered a great show. Borders in a sense have been broken, coincidentally in a time when a virus physically forces them to close.This show was thought provoking and makes you ask really think about life in general. We're all trying to get rich. But being rich doesn't buy happiness nor does it buy you health."
33,Squid Game,"This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.It uses ""Hunger Games"" as it's base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of ""actors"" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it's meant to be!"
34,Squid Game,"So, having heard much about this show and of course the controversies, I knew I had to give it a watch.The show follows 456 players who engage in child like games in order to win £££ prize money, but don't realise how deadly the stakes for the games are!I found the show to be great for the most part, the games they set for the players are dark and twisted versions of the kids games we all remember from our childhoods, I'm 27 by the way! The sets were good, the characters were good especially the lead and the english dubbing wasn't too bad! The TV Show is gory & dark in a lot of areas & reminds me of the Hunger Games crossed with Saw!The only things that I found were off were the filler parts of the Show, the talking parts, the drawn out scenes all seemed to drag quite a bit, ok character development is a must, but cutting it down & getting to the point is also a must not to mention consistancy!Overall, it's a good Show with a creative premise and good story to follow! The games are creative with their own dark & sinister twist to them! The Show does drag in areas, but is pretty entertaining all the way! Roll on Series 2!7/10."
35,Squid Game,"Squid GameA very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan's Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the ""losers"" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers ""side-hustle"" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the ""real"" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed ""worthless"".The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but ""manga"" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!I'm giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers."
36,Squid Game,Squid game is a great TV show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money. The TV show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money. I enjoyed the TV show: it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes. Some mysteries also and some big revelations. I enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch. I will recommend anyone to watch this TV Show. It was quite good.
37,Squid Game,"I don't know if it's a must for Netflix shows to become lame at the very end. It became very far-fetched and melodramatic and Gi-hun signaled virtue the whole time as if he didn't get back to the game while he knew he had to kill people and as if he didn't cheat the old man at the marble game. I wish he just stood up and admitted what he did. His mother died and he helped the mother of the other finalist (that stabbed himself in the neck at the squid game) by giving her the money and then took the North Korean girl's brother from the orphanage and before flying to the US to see his daughter, he called the corporate again to make them pay back. And another thing is that the old man was in fact the Korean Jigsaw in the game. He was rich so he wanted to lose track of time just like he'd do when he was a child so he did all what he did. And he died at an empty flat right before the sleeping old drunk man in the street received help just like Gi-hun. He died a few seconds before midnight as if we needed more far-fetched stuff.I enjoyed the show except for the final episode. The idea and the execution was good and the acting didn't take me out of it except for the actors who play American guests. I like the characters and their background stories. And on top of all this, there's this amazing episode 6 so I rated it 8 out of 10."
38,Squid Game,"One of the best and most interesting shows I've seen in recent years. I was hooked right from the start. Far out plot, wonderfully unique and layered characters, and a true breakneck pacing that's sure to keep you glued. I went in rather skeptical since hype has often let me down, but I can honestly say I was dead wrong. As soon as the credits rolled on the final episode, I had half a mind to start a rewatch with the new perspective the ending grants.Incredible."
39,Squid Game,I really loved this shot series best series of the uear no question asked but the ending kinda bad but overall fantastic.
40,Squid Game,"Squid Game isn't easy viewing at all; and I believe that it was meant to make viewers uncomfortable and distressing as all hell, because that's what desperation with life-and-death situations are truly like, and it can actually break who we are as people.456 players, 45.6 billion South Korean won, six games, and only ONE player can come out as the grand champion after everyone else has been killed. To make matters even worse these people were kidnapped off the streets because of their debts to collectors, yet outside the world is far more unforgiving than the brutal takes on classic kid's games.Netflix managed to strike gold with this show, which I guess took off because of the pandemic's devastating effects on ALL of society, and the themes of desperation and survival resonated with anyone and everyone who tuned into this breakaway mega-hit. It got people so invested it became a massive meme, where people parodied the thing, cooked up fan-theories and mocking the show's all-English dub.In spite of the showy production values in Squid Game, the characters are still very much like real people who've got real frustrations, real tension inside them, and very real everyone-for-themselves urgency to their character arcs. Squid Game is still a grounded story in spite of its SELECT sci-fi/spy-fi trappings and comic-book-like iconography with the 'PlayStation Men' and mysterious leader.Squid Game is Netflix's unexpected phenomenon; and I reckon there'll be those who understand and appreciate it and those who won't.Memes or no memes, this is a show definitely worth your time."
41,Squid Game,"Review By Kamal KDark portrayals of greed, low self value and distorted view of reality based on the twisted social standards that are rooted in the obsession over money that takes away all the joy of life - all wrapped in a completely unrealistic scenario sprinkled with dark comedy tone, that emphasizes the absurdity of the characters' choices and behaviors.The childlike locations and games present a drastic contract to the brutality of the scenarios the characters are facing. The game creators put themselves in the position of innocent keepers of the rules, and any tragic deaths are the fault of the participants for breaking them. No one is forced to participate - you signed your death certificate yourself.Survival in the game and survival in daily life serve as another good contrast - the physical brutality versus the emotional and existential dread. It's more than survival games drama, the true horror is the reality of these people outside of the games and what they can do in the given situation to change it.Blood and murder are this show's best friends, be aware of that before watching. Realistically speaking, this is not some new higher level of gruesome scenes, but they don't shy away from showcasing deaths and accidents.The acting from all the adults was truly amazing. Like in any drama, some roles had more depth and were more demanding than others, but none of the characters felt like an empty placeholder to fill the scene.But then we had the group of foreign actors with such an exaggerated line delivery, I was thinking I'd rather mute the screen. Not one of them did a good job. All sounded like licence free sound bites.Any flaws or complaints?Depends on what you are looking for. Do not expect any elaborate death traps and clever tricks - it's far more simple. It is pure survival with technically simple rules and games. You won't wreck your brain trying to understand what is going on, since the plot is rather straightforward with no unexpected plot twists that turn the whole plot upside down.You might want to sit down and analyze the message of the show and what might be the meaning behind. Depending on the viewer it could be a decent kill count watch with a bit of excitement, or a depressing portrayal of collapsing morals and society, as the money sucks all the joy out of our lives.There has also been a random sex scene, and I don't think we needed that ""final"" nail in the coffin - it was clear even without it that people would do anything for survival and money.Some details make exactly zero sense, and I truly mean zero. If you are lucky, you will not notice them at all, since they are less than minor. Squid Game is not exactly free from plot holes, but none of them have a big impact on the story. Some plot lines do hit the dead end though.Overall, it was a brutal drama, yet somehow I found myself laughing at quite a number of scenes. The dark comedy, calling out the hypocrisy - all that was truly amazing. 2/3 of the show was a solid 9.5, and I'm a bit frustrated with where the show went after that. Still, quite an enjoyable watch, with interesting set designs, well written characters and some solid thrills. They were able to get me attached to the characters and feel their desperation and pain."
42,Squid Game,"Not sure about all the hype but certainly great fun and slickly made.Nothing really new in the plot. Rich bored gamblers making desperate humans kill each other for their enjoyment.I guess the difference between this and so many before is the excellent character development and talented acting. Direction, cinematography all good. I think Alice in Borderland was slightly more adventurous but this was certainly slicker.A great binge watch!"
43,Squid Game,"The series takes specific aim at South Korea but it's certainly universal in 2021, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare so many injustices. Superb acting performances heighten the drama and particularly from Lee, who makes Gi-hun irresistibly likable despite his many defects. All of the characters undergo enormous trauma and the actors rise to the challenge of portraying believable emotions in a very unbelievable setting."
44,Squid Game,"I had fun binging for two days. It's seems like a mashup of the Hunger Games, Saw, Bond villains and wacky Asian reality game show. Very good character development. I felt I knew the characters well halfway in the series. The first two episodes are a little slow, then the show ramps up to speed. The last episode is a tear jerker. The weakest part, as many have said we're the VIPs. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was the screenplay dialogue was poorly written.It's certainly a different kind of watch most Americans are not used to. But that's a good thing. Netflix makes it easier to watch foreign content so that our cultural bobble burst and we get more diversely made content from around the globe."
45,Squid Game,"Decent set deco .Battle royal flavors.A bit long in runtime, especially after first half.Very bloody and gory at times.Addictive if thats your cup of tv tea."
46,Squid Game,"Fly Me to the Moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
A Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss meNow imagine listen to that calming jazz melody, sipping some wine, and watching more than 400 people getting murdered playing some kid's games.A brand new Netflix Korean thriller. This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special. But yeah, that's my ranking of all the rounds in this first season."
47,Squid Game,"For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you'll definitely notice and say when you're watching ""that character is me!"".It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth.As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. That they only find pleasure in people suffer."
48,Squid Game,"Most of the characters are very well written, sadly I can't say the same about the story. A lot of plotholes, and just overall sruff that didn't make sense. But apart from that, most aspects are pretty much fine. So all in all, an above average series but certainly not great or anything.7/10: good but not great."
49,Squid Game,"""You don't trust people because they are trustworthy. You do it because you have nothing else to rely on""Squid Game is thoughtful, provocative, and darn productive in every sense. Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some 'Masterpiece'. Contrary to popular belief, it's not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn't be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I'm leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it. Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?"
50,Squid Game,"So intense, so well crafted, so many meanings, dramatic, sadistic, emotional...television doesn't get much better than this."
51,Squid Game,"Gaming with human lives has been a subject in movies since The Most Dangerous; or even before; any movie about Gladiators was basically about people risking their lives to entertain the public.However, after the worldwide success of PARASITE the subject of social struggle has become preponderant also on the Korean movies.Many from that country like Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Lady Vengeance or Old Boy had lots of references about the social fight ; poor people trying to survive, rich people abusing them; but recently has become the full theme; thus this series.Contrary to expectations; the gore and violence level in the series is not that high; but the drama is.The first 7 chapters is about the people's misery around and why they accept to bet their lives for money. The characters lives are depressing desperate losers and (with one exception) selfish and far from sympathetic; all of them seem to be guilty of their own tragedies.Hundred of people are killed but most of them are unknown or have no empathy. We only get to know only a few of the characters; which will eventually mostly die.The games are not spectacular but the suspense is well crafted.The first problem is that the series is in itself too slow (for my own taste); a faster pace and at least two hours less could make it a lot better.The oppressing classes appears by the final chapters but is more really a caricature than real people. Too cliched for its own good.The second big problem is the resolution. In may ways contradicts all the previous ideas. Perhaps preparing people for a follow up.In brief; it requires a lot of patience the the depiction of the human condition and the consequences of bad choices make it worth a view (if you and your family can bear the killings)."
52,Squid Game,"Season 1: Despite a notable lack of momentum during fair amounts of Squid Game's dialogue, Hwang Dong-hyuk's concept itself is extraordinarily compelling and fun. Especially during the dystopian child's-games sequences, the performances are incredibly lifelike and plenty of shocks are delivered. Seriously, minus the slow-burning dialogue, grab some snacks and you're ready for an unforgettable binge.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
53,Squid Game,"But there were some plot holes. The cop should have been caught ten times before he died but he magically escaped or the scene just went out.Also, I never understood the organ harvester, where he came from and how he was able to ply his trade...But I really enjoyed the series except of a couple of the later episodes where there was an inordinate amount of blah blah blah."
54,Squid Game,"A pretty gripping show that has 7 solid episodes.Sadly it has one filler episode and falls apart a bit at the end, but for the most part it's a season that you can't stop watching.Definitely worth a watch and am recommending to my friends.Don't think it needs a second season but I imagine one will be made."
55,Squid Game,"So Squid Game has taken over the world these last few weeks and I thought that I had to watch it and I have now finished it and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck Koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize.Main Character
Lee Jung-Jae plays the lead character Gi-Han on the show and he is fantastic. At first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions. As he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support.Supporting Characters
There is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.Story
The story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn't work for me and I think it could have been handled better. Also there are these English speaking VIP's and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.Script
The script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles. For the love of everything holy don't watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching.Style
The show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole. It is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale. The pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and great in there own way.Overall
Overall, Squid Game is a truly fantastic show that was so close to getting my 10/10 score. It is a must watch and don't let the language barrier turn you off and get started with it as soon as possible.Rating - 9/10."
56,Squid Game,"A great story and sufficient background to get the series started with the pilot episode. But by the 4th eps it's dragging quite a bit and they make a scene ensuring that all the games are of ""fair play"".Two games later they throw out this concept and it's all based on luck instead of skill. Absolutely terrible games of chance.This dude shopped this project around for 10 years before Netflix picked it up. Maybe in that time he should have had a few buddies proof read the script and give him some pointers. This needs work.I'm sure that there will be a season 2 for this, hopefully with some better talent can help this dude write a better script. Could have been a 9 star series but just got boring and predictable."
57,Squid Game,"When he finally wins some money...only to lose it 3 seconds later, i turned it off and didnt come back for a while. But eventually I did and it is pretty good. Of course it drags 30 minute episodes into 1 hour long episodes..but its still good. Both twists were so predictable. The police brother and the old man were so obvious...and what is the message of the show...Being rich is just awful...lol Korea must have lots of poor people."
58,Squid Game,"Perfect to binge watching, this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted, twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments. While not really perfect, this is a perfectly fine Netflix entertainment. Totally recommended!"
59,Squid Game,"This is a show that asks us a simple question - is mankind inherently good or inherently evil? The answers the show comes up with may surprise you. I loved all nine episodes - it was funny, tragic, violent, and suspenseful. There was some gore in this show - but it wasn't done without catharsis. The acting in this show is just tremendous, especially the lead actor. And the writing is excellent. One of the most important binge shows of our time."
60,Squid Game,"So.... the ENTIRE premise is based on 'let's play games that we played as kids, that were based on skill and that are completely fair, and we're ALL on equal ground'.... series keeps that premise from EP01 until EP05, where it becomes not only a rigged game, but also no longer based on skill, but COMPLETELY based on luck. This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of ""we play fair games against each other, based on skill"" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn't completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series. I think they should make a Season2, and I just hope to God that in Season2, they don't completely derail the premise like they did in Season1, because Season1 is completely spoiled because of that."
61,Squid Game,"This country is already done if this is the greatest show of the year. This is cheap and lame, and if this is what is entertaining to people, I really fear for the future."
62,Squid Game,"I just watched this because of the hype. I really enjoyed the series even it's predictable parts.First, acting is mostly great from main characters but some of the secondary are pretty amateurish.Second, the story and ideas are not original but are pretty well executed even I didn't like the overall conclusion.Last, I wish a bit of more risky script because there are only a few unpredictable situations or plot twists if you have watched similar series/movies.So, overall great but not perfect."
63,Squid Game,"""Squid Game"" is definitely a slow burn in its first 2 episodes (but they do give you a taste of what's to come). As for the rest of the season, you probably won't be able to stop watching thanks to its story, characters, thrills, twists, games and, of course, gore."
64,Squid Game,"If you enjoy Korean movies then this is a must see. Has become a real hit, cool idea, interesting games and drama. Plenty of story to continue more seasons , I've got final 2 EPs left but have really enjoyed up to this point."
65,Squid Game,"Typical Korean ott actionand some real life back stories thrown in for good measure.Was good to see a non Korean, Ali Abdul, in this.Thoroughly entertaining and a great distraction from all the madness in the world."
66,Squid Game,"This is a great show to binge watch, even if it doesn't introduce anything all that new and original.The fact that it isn't American made means that it's one show that Netflix couldn't poison with its toxic political agendas. It's just the vision of its creators - and that's fresh nowadays.I know people complain about the ending, but if you watch Alice in Borderlands (which you should, it's also a great show, Japanese this time) you'll know what a bad ending really is. That show didn't end with any conclusion.But Squid Game, trust me, it will have more seasons due to its success, but even if it didn't, it ended nicely, pretty much answering most questions and delivering good conclusions to everything. If anything, I believe more seasons would ruin this, but let's see what happens.In any case, the hype is real, this is a good show you should watch, just don't expect groundbreaking character development or much originality. The characters are mostly cliches we've seen before, and so is the concept of deadly games.But, again, the standards are low nowadays, and this show is just captivating and interesting enough to raise above everything else there is to watch right now."
67,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a different type of show and I'm all for it! I really liked watching this the hidden message seems to be about the crisis of debt in south korea and just how far some desperate people are willing to do for some cash. I thought it was a very intense adventure that was followed, such an entertaining craft this show has been made into. I avoided the reviews upon watching, instead i decided to give it a go and I'm glad i did as its very engaging to the point you cannot watch one episode, this is definitely a bingeworthy one to catch as soon as possible, before the internet ruins it for you.I definitely recommend watching this, some moments will have you laughing although others will have you the complete opposite, it got me good on some parts in both ways.Check it out! Now on Netflix!"
68,Squid Game,"This new take on an old story makes for a compelling mini series. . We tend to miss out on gems in the states due to poor or no dubbing and laziness. Movies like oldeboi and sympathy for lady vengeance felt groundbreaking then and so I can understand the hype for seemingly obscure South Korean entertainment rn. Then of course, because of the hype i almost missed out on this. So if your on the fence give it a go. Not quite as predictable as the same old .I appreciate Netflix making foreign shows more accessible."
69,Squid Game,"Is this show art or sadistic hype? Or just criticism of capitalism? The cynical display of social injustice in Squid Game is not a pose. The South Korean screenwriter and director Hwang Dong-hyuk came up with the idea for the series during the 2008 financial crisis - brutally and directly.The series is a criticism of the world as it is. A double-edged sword. The protagonist Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) - an unemployed chauffeur who slipped into gambling addiction after losing his job - depends not only on the prize money to gain custody of his daughter, but also to one to pay for an important operation for his mother. He becomes part of a show for life and death.A mass extinction staged by Netflix. Is this good or bad? You can look at it, even if a lot is reminiscent of Stephen King."
70,Squid Game,"RATED 8/10
Language: Korean-Tamil
Source: Netflix
RECOMMENDEDLiked the first episode and it was so intriguing to continue the further episodes. Its pure entertaining series with some of the episodes are so predictable. The human emotions and situations makes it more interesting to watch. The Tamil translation is so good, not like crappy movie dubbing.Has lot of bad words and gory sequences."
71,Squid Game,This was an absolutely unique and honestly surprisingly great show. For a show based out of a different country and filmed in a different language to still have this effect on everyone universally says a lot about how good it is. Excited for the next season.
72,Squid Game,"What I liked about itVery addicting for most of the series. Couldn't let go of it.Except for a couple actors, I thought the overall acting was pretty good. MINYU was particularly noticeable - super obnoxious character.Plus points for pulling off a genre that wasn't attempted in K-dramas before.The set and the overall color of the series. Very vibrant color in contrast to the rather grotesque story the series portrayed. Loved that.Decent ending for the games. Was an unexpected ethos of arriving to a rather predictable conclusion.Just the right amount of gore for my taste.----What I didn't like about itVIPs were so cringe. I suppose it's hard to find decent English speaking non Korean actors in Korea. They were truly atrocious.Unclear messaging. Maybe not unclear - just a bit messy job conveying the message.Ep 8-9 were a little dragged on - could have had faster pace.The cop storyline was a little off-putting. Wish we saw more depth and development in there."
73,Squid Game,"I don't understand the hype. Alice in borderland is much more better than this. Maybe it get it's hyped because of Netflix,I don't see any other reason."
74,Squid Game,I loved this show for many reasons. The story was great I loved the concept and characters. The violence and gore was great too. The downfall is the bad acting at times it's kinda laughable bad. Overall a great surprise and I want more seasons even if it's with a new cast. I want more !!!
75,Squid Game,"I mean, I'd say I liked The Hunger Games better - but not The Maze Runner. There's a real grimness to The Squid Games. Like The Platform. With every episode you're ground down deeper just like these poor saps who find themselves there. I liked it well enough though it was long and the characters pretty familiar to this genre. It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life. I can't say I get the uproar of the series - Netflix's potential biggest- but it's worth a watch if you like dystopian stuff - and who doesn't?"
76,Squid Game,Its different but the same basically a different take on the violent game shows were nobody really wins. Episode 6 was the best episode. If there's a season two it needs to be the revenge.
77,Squid Game,Believe the hype this is one of the best shows to ever hit Netflix. Every episode gets better and better and the acting is spot on. The action scenes are beautiful the whole concept is crazy but in this case crazy works.
78,Squid Game,"This is definitely a special show and I was hooked from the very beginning with the first game played. While some plot elements are somewhat obvious with who the winner will be because of the main character being established early on, there are plenty of unexpected twists and turns. Plus, the directing style with the camera work, choice of colors, set designs, editing, etc was very artistic and noteworthy. The acting from a few specific characters as well deserves praise, I greatly enjoyed the show and always couldn't wait for more!"
79,Squid Game,"This tv show is very good to me, something different from what we are used to watch, for me is very original."
80,Squid Game,"The plot is similar to SAW and LOST. But,the Korean makers have given enough depth to the characters in this web series, that you feel for the characters even though it is predictable. There are enough shock value moments that keeps you hooked. Worth binge watching!!"
81,Squid Game,"The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I'll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I'm out."
82,Squid Game,"A little too much of an advertised series for my taste. I decided to give it a try anyway, there aren't a lot of episodes anyway. Overall, I have to admit that it is a very good series, the best part of it are some of the characters and how various circumstances and the environment affect them. I was mentally prepared for the violence and the blood so it didn't surprise me, I even thought the violence would be even more pronounced. Of these nine episodes, three were below level for me personally, including an ending I didn't like. There are also a few elements in the series that aren't original because we've seen them before, it's not a new concept of how people fight to the death to win a competition. It is somewhat predictable. That's why everything else in the series is at a very high level, the story, the characters, the mystery, I give it two thumbs up."
83,Squid Game,"Utterly gripping, engrossing, and devastating, Squid Games hit's a level of tension few other series have. It's not perfect, a little consistent for a single episode, but it is so absorbing at every other moment it seems impossible to mark the series down.Characters are distinct, develop brilliant bonds and each have their own developmental arc. Certain characters show such morality and innocence that investment is put into their stories almost instantly. Backstories are a mixture of tragic and sinister, providing a footing for the audience to base their impressions, but these are twisted and warped so brilliantly throughout that a fully-fleshed out character is always the final product.Acting cannot be faulted, and as a newcomer to Korean TV, all impressions of the actors are fresh. Outbursts of emotion are very explosive, and should be seen and heard in Korean to fully appreciate them.The plot has maybe been played out in various ways in past media, but possibly without such a holistic approach. Down-on-their-luck participants playing life-or-death children's games seems simple, but the execution is perfect due to the building tension. Violence is graphic and intense, but the gore comes in relatively short bursts. The progression of each episode gives the violence such power.One episode in particular is crushing, once a connection has been formed between the audience and each character. The cruelty of each game is paramount, but the reactions within them are devastating.Unfortunately, the most devastating episode is followed by the most disappointing. The introduction of the VIPs is so below the standard of the rest of the characters/series, leaving them out completely and keeping some irritating mystery would have been a lot more satisfying than the lacklustre impact they make. Built on cliches and stuck with terrible dialogue not improved by the acting, it's the one episode that goes against the rest of the series.Having said that, it may have been a necessary evil. It matches with the storyline, but still felt like an addition no one wanted. It cannot detract from the entire series though, everything before is brilliant, everything after saves it again, producing a worthy ending."
84,Squid Game,"This is the first Korean drama I've watched while I was absolutely blown away. There were a couple of moments where I thought the story dragged a little, however it was all added for tension I'm sure. It was absolutely stunning to look at and really well done. I can't wait to see what happens in the next series."
85,Squid Game,"Hype that will not stand up with time. This series does not measure up to the standards of good, much less great, Korean Drama. The cast is excellent, of course (except for the VIPs, though the inside joke on American actors is rich), but the plot is predictable from the beginning through to the end. From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable.However. Blessings on Netflix for bringing international film to the world, especially during the pandemic. But don't try to own it, guys: just stream it."
86,Squid Game,Wow!! No show has ever stressed me out as much as this one. It was seriously insane and crazy and hilarious all at once. Kept me on the edge of my seat that's for sure. It had me laughing and crying and terrified.
87,Squid Game,"A battle royale vibe with more to say about the world we live in. Well written, designed, acted and a credit (as if we needed another one) to Korean film and TV makers."
88,Squid Game,"I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode. I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental ""here is why"" explanation. I believe that was obvious. The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode.It's worth a go. It teaches age old lessons again but it's always worth learning them, again."
89,Squid Game,"The talk and reviews have me bewildered, I'm only up to Ep3 but am struggling after about 5 attempts to start bingeing.I find it boring and really childish, with pretty ordinary acting.The set design, art direction and general production values are very 1970's.Two more attempts then I'll give up."
90,Squid Game,"Caught a bit by the hype I decided to check this out and boy was I in for a convoluted messy nonsense pile of garbage.I will not go through all the problems with each episode but rather describe the three overarching issues I have with the show.1) the acting - the acting is fine from the 3-4-5 main characters, everyone else however are horrible at it. Someone said that is the point, okay, sure, but if so you direct them different and give them less to do and more to the point scenes so their extremely bad acting do not shine through.2) the production value - this is so low budget that I had a good cry at least half a dozen times each episode. Sets are literary falling apart and you can clearly see the bad construction. You can also hear the lousy music, see the bad clothing, the low quality film work etc. Etc. This is like high-school students having a laugh level of production value.3) Cliche and tiresome nonsense - we have seen all of this many, many times before. All done better, with better acting, better production value, better directing, better story and with a lot better social criticism. This is just a bored Korean mixing some of his favourite movies and tv shows together into nonsens while claiming he is doing the world a favour by exposing capitalism... yawn... Perhaps look a bit north you dirty wet sock of a man you.Put the above together with further critique of each episode and you have some boring nonsense no one should care about. Not sure why people do, but people running around with face masks injecting themselves and bending over for the global elite is surely to like anything you put in front of them. A generous 3/10 and I can not recommend anything about this."
91,Squid Game,"It's a breathe of fresh air to see actors not acting like god and stuck in attack-victimise-saviour loops.But by the 4th episode the main villain (in the game), after being really villainous, is treated like a hero and is given nearly all the screen time. The viewer doesn't want to see this guy anymore...After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral. The whole story turns into a confused cliche to skip through."
92,Squid Game,"This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: ""The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!""The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians. The best actor in the whole show is the main character's daughter and she's only in it for a couple of minutes.As per usual for a Netflix production the story is stretched very thin in order to make it nine hours (!) long."
93,Squid Game,"It's been so long since Netflix produced something that's actually good. It's not really surprising that Squid Game arrived from the Eastern cinema, considering the Western Cinema has been dry out of ideas for years at this point. Squid Game is just such a breath of fresh air in 2021, because so far in this year all we got was trash.This show is just so compelling in almost every way. The characters all have differing personalities and ideas and motives, making each character likable in their own different ways. There's no such thing as a ""perfect"" character in Squid Game; everybody is trying to win and they'll give up their own morals to survive. This show focuses on the dark sides of humanity, and it doesn't shy away of what people can do to each other, and that's why this show is so refreshing, because we have realistic people doing realistic things.The overall concept of Squid Game isn't really all that innovative, (a battle royal-ish game being spectated by privileged rich people), but everything around it is innovative. The set design is just fantastic. It's colorful with a bright aesthetic which contrasts well with the dark themes. The directing and acting is also really solid all around, and the pacing is perfect. The only issue being a subplot that ends up leading to nothing.Squid Game is an overall masterpiece of a show. It's extremely thrilling and it'll pull your heartstrings. It's an easy show to get emotionally invested in, and it ends in the most dramatic way possible. This is a show that I'd recommend to anyone and I really hope they make a second season, because this is the content that we need in dry times like these."
94,Squid Game,"SummarySquid Game is a series with a wonderful production design, a staging that displays a powerful iconography and that admits several readings and records various influences and cinematographic antecedents. Anyway, it is mostly a thriller and a melodrama. Erecting it as a sociopolitical essay is perhaps an excess, although the crude allegory of neoliberal capitalism is clear and its anti-meritocratic message is accurate.REVIEW:456 people with a desperate economic situation agree to risk their lives in a series of games that take place in a concentration environment to win a significant sum of money.I am a person who distrusts the massive successes, so I began to see the series with all the precautions of the case; however, it turned out to be an extremely interesting experience.The gamesThe participants become part of a regime that is concentration-oriented for more than one reason: because of seclusion, military surveillance, because of its violence, cruelty and sadism, and because of its disregard for the human condition and life. The games (based on children's games) are extremely different and generate different and changing dynamics between the participants and a variety of climates between the chapters, although they all display different types of violence. The fewer participants there are, the bigger the prize becomes.The playersThose who play these games constitute a heterogeneous group of desperate people, generally downfalls of the system and highly indebted, the latter situation that alludes to a widespread problem that afflicts South Korea. Their situation pushes them to put their lives at risk, to which they no longer find meaning, and to commit atrocious acts for economic salvation. Little by little the plot will focus on a group of characters, some of whom nevertheless retain traits of humanity in the midst of despair.The systemOne of the first questions that assail the viewer is who is behind the Squid Game, who is organizing it and for what purpose. Unveiling this unknown is essential for the credibility of the story. What's more, it is initially the most intriguing part of the series, as the games and the place where they take place exhibit an extremely sophisticated and expensive organization and infrastructure.Production design and stagingOne of the highlights of the series is its wonderful production design: colorful, creative, elegant and imposing. It exhibits a powerful iconography that allows you to create a world of your own. As in all Korean series, the staging is brilliant, from the intimate melodramatic scenes to the suspense or violence of the games or in combination. Knows how to use the sequence shot and the fixed shot.The gendersThe series can be defined as a thriller profusely watered with gore, crossed, as in any Korean production worth its salt, by the most resounding melodrama when it investigates the stories and motivations of its characters and their interactions during and outside of games. At a certain point, he even ventures into the western.The cinematographic backgroundSquid Game, due to its internal logic, recognizes several cinematographic antecedents; Among others, one can cite Cronenberg's Videodrome and the saga The Hunger Games, only that it takes place in a rigorous present. But there is another little-cited reference: the concentration regime and other elements refer to Pasolioni's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Other aspects are reminiscent of Eyes Wide Shut by Kubrick. Its powerful iconography and staging that create worlds of their own can also be assimilated to those of The Handmaid's Tale.Social, economic and political readingsAlthough I consider that these readings are somewhat overvalued or overanalyzed, it is clear that the dynamics of the games and their participants can be assimilated to that of neoliberal capitalism in its extreme forms (as was Nazism at the time), so much so that it concerns the participants as well as their organizers; it even raises up to a culmination of its predatory logic. A supposed and cynical framework of equal opportunities governs where, however, chance is decisive and despair and the promotion of extreme individualism permanently abort the collective organization. The series also shatters the meritocratic fantasy.The performancesThe performances are very good; They range from naturalism to a certain common buff emphasis on oriental gestures and dramaturgy. They generate empathy and mixed feelings based on the changing behaviors of their characters.The soundtrackSpecial mention for the remarkable soundtrack, which, as in the story, ranges from meditative piano solos to frenetic rhythmic sequences."
95,Squid Game,"Netflix K-drama might offer nothing new as a survival-show dystopian thriller but deft writing and fine craftsmanship made it worth the hype even for international audience. Some gratuitous violence over nail-biting twists and turns kept our interest till the end.Each contestants for some reasons had purposes due to rounded character developments. They took 'companionship' to next level including shocking revelations we could barely see. Convincing ensemble cast effectively triggered audience to pick sides in every deathly familiar games.My most to leave fave:
1. Tug of War
2. Glass Bridge
3. Red Light Green Light
4. Honeycomb Shape Cutting
5. Squid Game
6. Marble Games."
96,Squid Game,"I feel like I can't really write a critical review because the TV show is that popular. Everyone is raging about it and it will end up making a billion dollars even though they for some reason only sold it for like $20m to Netflix. The first 5 episodes is great cinema. It's a great concept with people playing games with each other for a big money prize at the very end and the losers get killed. The 3 first games are fine enough, but only the first one is great. It does feel like it's always a promise of something bigger and better. Some big reveal that will make the TV show better and deliver on all the hidden factors. But in reality the more they reveal the worse the show gets. It's like revealing the monster in a movie to be some bad CGI creature. Episode 6 already contains a very weak nonsensical game. And the last 2 games are bad. So out of 6 games only 1 was good! That's pretty lame. The twist and turns also all lead to a worse TV show unfortunately. The first 2 episodes promise something big, but instead the show jumps the shark.A gang starts killing other competitors. But why? The more participants are left the higher is your own chance of survival as each participant is testing the games and finding out how to play them better so that everyone's chance of survival increases. So if the gang didn't kill anyone their chance of survival would skyrocket and they could just kill anyone they want before the last game.There is also a side-plot with a cop filming everything. This plot goes nowhere. He is just killed by his brother who runs the game place. But what the cop does makes no sense. For example, as he escapes they see him climb down a ladder. Before they got to him he had already put on a random diving suit and jumped into the water. So we are to believe this happened in maybe 2 minutes? We didn't even know if he could dive or not. It's also not clear why his brother runs the place. He just left his small cheap apartment suddenly and let his fish die to be this extremely powerful figure? The cop later throws his oxygen tanks on a beach while a boat searches for him. So of course they see the oxygen tank from afar and know he is there. These sort of things at the end of the show make no sense. He could have easily hidden on the island and then later found some fishing boat he could wave at.The main problem is of course the big reveal. It's all a violent show for billionaires so they watch people in debt kill each other for a prize. This idea has been explored a thousand times before in many B movies and it doesn't work here either. These Westerners are HORRIBLE actors. It's inexcusable. You can easily get a random person to act better than this. But I assume they were directed by someone who didn't speak English? The episodes they are in are obviously not fun to watch for anyone.And then there are the game rules. They make no sense and are not clearly explained. At times you see some huge twist in a game and a participant saying ""Well, you said the rules were such and such so that's how I won the game"". So after the fact we get some info about how this guy broke a game. This is a thing in all 6 games. The rules are vague and winners and losers just come about by some mystery. It's not terrible, just a bit weak as it makes little sense. In game 5 on the glass panels you even see the game maker shut off the light to make the game harder as they were near the very end. The game maker needed the last game to only have 2 survivors as only 1 winner is allowed. So while everyone thinks there is no limit and groups plan to win together in reality only one person can win yet no one knows this besides the game maker himself. This is also why the moderators let people kill each other and change the games as they are ongoing to kill a few more people. Also, the gang gets info about what game they are to play beforehand. Kinda a huge deal. These sort of changes and twists make it harder to really feel like these are real games. Rather it's just methods to kill people. The rules are never fair. At one point a game maker even takes part in a game and makes his own team win. Honestly, the reveals are horrible. The brother reveal makes no sense as we don't even know how the cop or brother is. And the old guy who also plays the games is a bad reveal too because it's just a random twist. It's not some info we were looking for.The ending makes no sense either. The winner doesn't spend any money even though he promised to help some specific people. Family members of friends killed in the game. And at the end he just walks somewhere. We never really understand what his plans are. If he or 500 other people wanted to they could have revealed the game. We even see him talk to cops. And many others surely also talked to cops. Even in the VIP areas were see a bunch of waiters and naked ladies just laying around. So all these random naked ladies know about all these murders too. Of course all the workers know about this too. If you want to have an ending with the winner trying to reveal the whole thing that makes absolutely no sense because he could have tracked this whole operation down in a week. They leave clues everywhere. If you put this info online people would find the location in a day. They would just search for underground buildings with huge automatic roofs that can open. Such projects would have thousands of workers and can be seen from space. This part of the TV show makes zero sense so having the lead decide to finally do something about it after a year makes no sense whatsoever. He could have revealed it all in a day. Anyone could. This and then the 2 big twist reveals are terrible. It's not really anything huge so you may just ignore it. But it illustrates how bad the writing actually is. It shows why the games are stupid and lazy too. It's not smart stuff."
97,Squid Game,"Animal World is in my top 10 all-time favorite movies, largely because it was truly an ORIGINAL plot & was so well executed! I love it for it's ORIGINALITY. The further along this series gets, the more I'm starting to enjoy it, but also it's becoming an IRREFUTABLE doppelganger of ""Animal World!"" From the debt, the transportation of the contestants, the Mom who's going into the hospital for serious health issues and he can't pay for it, the main character blowing his money on betting & being a child-like burden on his elderly Mom, signing away his Mom's house, the friend who betrayed him (when he knew what the candy-cutting game was) even knowing his friend will likely die and he had multiple opportunities to clue him in, the fact that they're way out on an island (cruise ship) where no one would expect them to be & couldn't find them, even to the organ harvesting! On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I'm pretty sure I've had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they've hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I'm right or wrong. It's a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don't use a movie like a precise blueprint, that's just plagiarism! So, because i love the premise so much, I'm hooked and have to see it to the end, even if it irritates me!"
98,Squid Game,"Squid Game had one of the best concepts, with mystery around few people who participates in a game with millions to win. The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series.The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next.The story went through well with a good last episode as well. But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season)."

100,Squid Game,A large group of people who are down on their luck are invited to a game where all their money troubles can be solved. The only thing they don't know is that it will be a bloody battle for survival and they will each learn how far they will go just to survive. It is a little predictable in the overall concept but does have some surprises in leading up to the finale. Well acted and a reasonable pace over 9 episodes with a few plot twists keeps your attention.
101,Squid Game,"Korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on Netflix called Squid Game.Taking inspiration from the simple childhood games played in Korea, a shadowy organization embarks on recruiting out-of-luck people who are burdened by large debts. They then proceed to make these 'contestants' participate in life-or-death versions of these simple games with a large pot of cash as a reward on offer for the final victor.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the genius director behind Silenced (2011) and The Fortress (2017), weaves a rich tapestry of intricate characters ranging from a Machiavellian investment banker to a lazy absentee dad to a North Korean refugee turned pick-pocket.Despite the immense production value and sets, it is these finely written characters that capture your imagination and sucker you into binging the 9-episode thrill ride at a stretch.Lee Jung-jae is electric as the gambling addict who has to embark on the game to cure his mom's illness while O Yeong-su captivates with his nuanced portrayal of an elderly man with seemingly nothing to lose, slowly dying with an ever-growing tumor in his head.Park Hae-soo plays all the layers of his troubled investment banker role with gusto, portraying all the ethical dilemmas and moral turpitude his character faces with conviction. Jung Ho-yeon buys you into the North Korean defector role and the lengths to which she will go to secure the money to enable the rest of her family to cross over to the South.With the storyline pointing clearly towards a Season 2, the director has left enough plot points incomplete to keep the audiences eager for the next instalment of this landmark series.Netflix seemingly has another worldwide sensation on its hands just as Money Heist seems to be drawing to a close.Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!"
102,Squid Game,"Pros:
1. There is great use of the colour palette, with greys, blacks, whites, browns and navy blues in the outside world used to portray a miserable, lifeless and oppressive world, whereas bright colours are used for Squid Game to ironically convey a place of death where they felt more alive and unburdened than they did in the outside world.2. The gore is brutal and gut-wrenching, but it's never over-the-top which helps the gore feel more real.3. The fight/ action scenes are raw and gritty, with the usage of close-up shots to heighten the claustrophobia and personal touch, thereby heightening the tension.4. The score does an incredible job at building up the atmosphere, in addition to being instantly recognisable.5. The deaths of Ali (Anupam Tripathi) Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) and Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) are deftly handled and are real tear-jerkers.6. The practical effects and set design are beautifully designed and they do an amazing job at building the Squid Game world.7. The show provides a really good psychological study on how humans react when their lives and fortunes are on the line, i.e. Self-preservation or cooperation; decisive or indecisive.8. Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is on the receiving end of a satisfying character ark from irresponsible, lazy and indecisive, to the complete opposite.9. There are phenomenal performances by Lee Jung-jae and Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo).Cons:
1. The flashbacks inserted to reiterate information the show has already told the audience, are redundant and patronising.2. It's baffling, and largely unbelievable, that the Squid Game operation has been going since 1999, yet only one cop in the recent year found multiple disappearances strange enough to investigate - and he was only investigating because of his brother.3. It was far too easy for Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-Joon) to infiltrate the secret island. You'd think that type of operation wouldn't make it as easy as they did to sneak onto the island.4. A lot of the information divulged during the show is done so via lazy exposition, the show doesn't seem to deem the audience intelligent enough to work things out for themselves.5. The criticism of the modern Neo-liberal, hyper-individualistic, capitalist system is rather on-the-nose, and it feels preachy and pretentious most of the time. There's a bizarre sub-theme of anti-Americanism and white supremacy that just feels forced.6. There is a ridiculous amount of screen-time wasted on a bizarre organ-harvesting sub-plot that doesn't go anywhere, and is clearly just placed so that the show can air the supposed virtue of equality and fairness, whilst Front man (Lee Byung-hun) who airs it, sanctions the killings of people who for whatever reason, found themselves in debt."
103,Squid Game,Takes the physiological killer game show idea from anime and manga and adapts into live action. After you get past the premise you actually find well written characters and doomed relationships which is very refreshing for an Anime plot. You find yourself liking people and cursing their inevitable death. I loved the extra side plot refreshing from some of the boring games they played. Don't watch this for the premise watch it for the relationships.
104,Squid Game,"Great show. Korean drama that is perceivable for N. American Audience. Similar story attempts have been made in the past, but this one has a great blend of Drama with a little unpleasantries."
105,Squid Game,"I mean its okay but drags on forever, the story was good nothing to write home about.I am happy a Korean Drama gets hyped even if its unwarranted means they are getting noticed,'d recommend this but have the ff botton ready."
106,Squid Game,"Yes, it's like the Japanese game genres like Liars Game, Death Note...etc but much more interesting characters and social commentary.Yes, in its core a social experiment like Lord of the Flies but then the main character is from A Man for all Seasons. The show basically ask will you be true to yourself? Do you have a price? The main guy, although a gambler, stayed true to himself as a nice person(deep down), believes in the goodness of humanity. Goodness of other people. (Just look at his smiley photo snapshot). Even though he won, he was much troubled by the lives lost, disgusted by the money, and dumbfounded by the ""reasoning"" behind it all.001, the number one man(1% of the world?) is basically echoing the sentiment of ""rosebud"" from Citizen Kane and laments the place where adults can never return to...childhood. But do you think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson would have watched this show? (Maybe Elon Musk). Na, they have a space race to run.There are many threads to follow up on if there's a 2nd season. The origin of this game. The cop that jumped off the cliff. The recruiter in the subway. And obviously will the main character go back to another game? And if so what will he do?I get there are bad acting segment with the VIP. But the they do serve the representation of crass upper class. Overall the length of the series is just right. Detail oriented, simple games, thoughtful interactions (the marble episode comes to mind), tense (first game, voting, tug of war, formation of groups ) and full of all the character arch (good, bad and ugly) of humanity. Great cinematography, color palette, bgm score, sets, character development, production and plot.The final game on the island is not a game but a duel of values. And ask again, will you be true to yourself? Same with the last bet on his death bed from the old man. But the irony is that he lost not only the bet but also his life. Double irony that he didn't get to see the results.Do you believe in the goodness of people?"
107,Squid Game,"The game is hell, the reality is hell. Japanese-style survival game + Korean-style dog blood. Lying all the way to win the new mode of the game, I feel not as good as the ""gambling implied record"". Human nature cannot be directly seen. The simpler the game, the more thorough the exposure of the ugly side of human nature. The purity of children's games and the life-to-life struggle between adults form a contrast, which is even more ironic. The character settings, personalities, and relationship portrayals are not bad. But the reversal of the ending is really a forced reversal, anticlimactic."
108,Squid Game,"I tend to argue that when South Korean creators are at their peak, they're giving 150%. This intensity and occasional brutality (the works hold back neither in terms of the raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like Secret Sunshine and Oldboy, while close to flawless, don't necessarily find pop-culture success the world over.But we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to South Korean media than bouncy BTS videos, more so than when Parasite arrived and gave the Korean Wave a considerable push. For all their problems, we can thank Netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform.I was incredibly excited to watch Squid Game, even though I at first deemed it ""suspiciously popular"". What was it? One of those rare pieces of media that's clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be ""hip"", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven't seen this type of art yet? (Or maybe those who only watched it because Korean media is the current ""cool"" thing to consume and didn't grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don't make sense about the setting, which, as per the show's themes and social satire, aren't supposed to make sense).Ultimately, Squid Game (original title Ojing-eo Geim) proved to mostly be the former. That is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don't understand it and enjoy it ""in spite of some plot holes"").At a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of The Hunger Games and Saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it's also a better social metaphor than The Platform). A varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a Kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children's games for a reward of 45 billion won. However, should they lose, the penalty is instant death.This becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave. It's around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking. I won't reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn't end at episode 2 of 9. Subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare.The characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable. We go from loathing the down-on-his-luck Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden ""Player 1"" (O Yeung-su) harbors strategic insight. There are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone.There is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character. I was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize I might not be joking. Squid Game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons.Some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious. That being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the Gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of TV/streaming I've seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft). It's not as unpredictable as Game of Thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it's hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest. This isn't the same as Plot Armor.My only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a Hunger Games sequel, complete with cartoonish Rich People™ from across the world, including ones who speak American English (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not English). And yes, I will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show's poetry and dramatic timing.Still, Squid Game is quite the piece of work and I could praise it for far longer than I already have. Its success sets a good precedent. Like Parasite (another far-reaching showcase of South Korean vigor), Squid Game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won't be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it's ""cool"" or not. Still, it's hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show's message.I'm told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on TikTok, and for what it's worth, the mainstream reaction could've been much worse. (My generation isn't much smarter than Zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in Project X.) We might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what I'm truly spaeing is for Elon Musk or whatever to take a look at this and go ""Squid Game, huh? That sounds pretty neat!"""
109,Squid Game,"A masterful series for its great script and interpretation of its actors. Lee Jung-jae has done a wonderful performance, but the best thing about this series is seeing human behavior and despair of not having money to live. We live in a world with money and without it you are nothing, and because of that money we are losing humanity itself, in a world that is increasingly populated and with less work to survive. The numbers don't add up, we'll see what the future holds for everyone due to lack of money."
110,Squid Game,"Well directed, pretty good writing, uneven acting (partly over the top theatrical, partly just as it should be), well produced and shot, keeps viewers' attention, slightly predictable at moments (and in general), masterfully edited and with an appropriate music score. As the tile says: good watch (but only once, since then you'll know ""the secret"", and the mystery will be gone forever)."
111,Squid Game,"Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2.This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout. Only minus was very bad VIPs acting."
112,Squid Game,"I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren't that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)"
113,Squid Game,"This show was phenomenal. I didn't start watching it for a few weeks after it came out because it didn't seem super interesting. It didn't appeal to me. But then it stayed at #1 on Netflix for over a month, everyone was talking about, and it seemed like the only thing on social media at the time, so I decided to check it out. I speak English, but I wanted to have the true show experience, so I watched it in Korean. I wanted to hear the actors real voices, and it bothers me when the voice doesn't match up with the movement on the screen. Regardless, the Korean actors were great. I don't know how to judge actors when they are speaking Korean, but it seemed really well done. I was skeptical about watching the VIP episode because of what people said about their acting. To be honest, I couldn't figure out what was so bad about it. Sure it wasn't amazing, and they were weird at times, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people said it was. I've talked about the acting, now I will talk about the show. Hwang Dong-hyuk is a genius. The plot of this show was so unique and so cool to watch. Every game that played was very entertaining to watch, it is hard for me to pick a favorite. I also liked how the show wasn't just these people playing kids games, it actually explored some of the characters lives. I just thought it was cool. Lastly, I loved the characters. All of them were great, but my favorites had to be Gi-hun, Ali, and the Old Man. Their characters were just so likable. Those were just my favorites, there were so many more I liked.If you haven't already, I definitely recommend watching this to anyone, you won't regret it. My recommendation is to watch the snow in Korean, but if you are just looking to relax and not read the subtitles whenever someone talks, watch it in your main language. I really hope there is a season 2, it will be cool to see what they do after the ending."
114,Squid Game,"Terrific show; a timely watch. While it certainly dabbles in issues regarding social status, I more so saw this show's narrative as a debate on society's morality and compassion. Mixing offbeat scenarios with unyielding brutality, Squid Game shows how desperate, callous and even savage humans can be when the conditions are met and that capitalism serves more as a byproduct of these behaviors. It asks the question: Does humanity still possess any decency in such an oppressed and unforgiving world? Highly recommend it. It's a breath of fresh air for anyone craving something unique. A gripping survival drama full of palpable suspense and sharp commentary."
115,Squid Game,"I'm usually not one to instantly check a show out when it's trending, but after seeing so many TikTok videos of people trying to cut perfect shapes out of the famous Dalgona snack cookies with small needles, and seeing how the stakes couldn't get much higher what with those who failed at said task would get killed (which was very jarring), I caved in and decided to see what I was missing. And after episode 9 ended, I want more. Because not only did the hype behind this show click, but it also may be even better than I thought it would already be. And me wanting more isn't me saying that the season was too short or anything, but considering how near flawlessly everything worked here, I've never been this interested in a show like this in a long time. One of the reasons for this are the characters. They're all so damn good and well written. Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Ali, Il-Nam, Sae-byeok, Jun-ho, and pretty much everyone else are all effective and very likable, even those who took villainous paths (being vague to avoid spoilers). This is emphasized by the performances, as they are absolutely phenomenal, as everyone here kills it. I felt the fear, anger, happiness, sadness, and tiredness from everyone here, making this have some of the best casting I've seen in a show yet. The story, as well, is superb. To keep it somewhat brief, it's essentially how people who are in massive amounts of debt are taken to a secret island where they must play childhood-like games to win-except, if you lose one of them, you don't just lose the game. You lose your life. At first, that may seem somewhat simple. But the way this show handles it with its excellent pacing, characterization, and world building (all with lots of gore), it works very, very well. It's not only tense, but it's very emotional. And that goes for all 9 episodes here. I was constantly at the edge of my seat. This show is also an excellent parody of capitalism, as it loosely portrays how the top 1% looks down on everyone else, and that even though money is the driving factor for everyone else, it's not necessarily money that makes life better-because the top 1% rot their brains of greed and are actually worse. So much so, that the lives of fellow people who are poor don't matter as much. And I think this show nailed that wonderfully. Overall, the first season is masterfully written, directed, performed, and executed, and I'm very excited to see what the inevitable season 2 brings to the table, because so far, this is one of the best shows I've seen in the past decade, and I hope Hwang Dong-hyuk keeps up the pace, because he did one hell of a job, here."
116,Squid Game,"This is the first Korean web series I've ever watched in my entire life and I watched it just because everyone were talking about it and everyone were appreciating it and that's why I watched it and believe me, spending my life's almost 9 hours for watching this was worthy. It's really too good and I would say that it's for everyone, I mean it has everything starting from Suspense, thriller, action, blood, comedy, adventure, plot twists, most of all is emotion, horror each and everything and that's what makes this series perfect."
117,Squid Game,The dose of enthusiasm and suspense is very beautiful .. but the end was supposed to be more beautiful.
118,Squid Game,"This is the first South Korean series I've ever seen. I really think it's a good one. The concept--similar to that of Hunger Games or Battle Royale, but they play children's games instead--is nothing new. But I really love how it's done.It's not really that scary. But it can be a bit disturbing. That mirror game is the only scary one. Episode 2 is the only one I didn't like much. I also wish the VIPs didn't talk. The acting is great, the characters are believable, making the viewers care for what's going to happen to them.Finale was quite anticlimactic, although I love that twist. It surprised be, to be honest."
119,Squid Game,"Really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. Started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the VIP stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. Has great production values and acting. Episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how Season 2 will turn out.8/10 for Season 1."
120,Squid Game,"A number of excellent films have come out of South Korea over the past decade or so. Now this, a blinder of a TV series. Absolutely fantastic. Was thinking of cancelling Netflix but glad I didn't."
121,Squid Game,"Who needs to watch 455 people being murdered? Some odd messaging on capitalism and income disparity coupled with reality TV game shows. Hey ccool, look the losers don't just fall into a pool then fall into an incinerator. Give it pass."
122,Squid Game,"In spite of the inevitable air of ludicrousness that all overdubbed shows have, this starts really well, with an idea that, if not entirely original, is shockingly and stylishly executed. But after the first ep it quickly sinks into a miasma of pointlessness: you don't care in the slightest about the characters, their sob stories, the reason for their mysterious ordeal, or - especially - the plot contortions needed to get an ongoing series out of what is basically a static situation.For a TV show, though, it certainly has visual flair, with a slew of such futuristic and dystopian influences as Escher, Kubrik. Fritz Lang, Flash Gordon and Tron. As against that, it gets a demerit for the appalling racial stereotype of the Pakistani character. You would never get away with that in an English-language show these days, and rightly so."
123,Squid Game,"Man! This show!Does everything right at the best times. Just when you forget some detail that would make you feel brilliantly smart, it comes back to whack you in the face!Like some of it's contemporaries it brilliantly fuses comedy and horror in the most psychological of way's and I must say, I really want more of this, and more like this."
124,Squid Game,"As survival series go, ""Squid Game"" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a ""Hunger Games"", ""Saw"", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards. The show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator.The stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind. The parts where they delved into the Human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom... This part, more than anything else, made this Korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted.The show came close to relying on clichéd tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow Dong-hyuk Hwang evaded all those loopholes and 'convenience zones'. He also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire.Every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point. Neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline. The thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work.Jaeil Jung's musical scoring more than 'made it work' where this series was concerned. He captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes. That ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often... That never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense.Great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes. These, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on IMDB), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric.A few negatives... There were no cameras in the restrooms. This particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there. No cavity checks of the prisoners - that was another 'tricky' omission. The highly trained guards were otherwise not immediately suspicious when one of their own started to act out of protocol. However, these and a handful of other 'loopholes' were needed to progress the plot and did not feel contrived - emphasis on that word, that's where the magic lay in this series.I highly recommend watching all nine episodes in their original Korean-language (non-dubbed) version. Feel free to rely on subtitles to stay informed. That's how I watched ""Squid Game"" on Netflix. The 'feel' was so much different than when I 'tested' a few minutes of the show in its English dub.Being in debt is no joke, it truly destroys lives and families, even entire friendships and romances. This series captured the sheer helplessness of being in debt, and it did so through its characters. It also captured the depths of human depravity, and what some people with too much money are willing to do.With Netflix's ""Squid Game"" Dong-hyuk Hwang has made a 'dark' mark one won't soon forget. He proved how artfully you can take a cliché, or something familiar, and twist it into something new. ""Squid Game"" had that in abundance, and made me feel like I was watching something genuinely artistic and soulful. The show went deep into the primal nature of Humankind instead of just showcasing our 'better nature'."
125,Squid Game,"There's a lot of hype surrounding this series. I thought it was okay, I almost didn't finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1. The problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable.After fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, I stuck with the show.So the show is visually interesting. I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)
There were quite a few irritating characters. Very stereotypical gangster type. You'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. But I'll get back to that later.Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. You also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades. Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. Then it just loses steam and gets dumb. The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story. It's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show.The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on.The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming. And it doesn't even play out all that well.After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored. What's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn't know who he was.They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk. I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs.See, so many questions, so many holes. The final ending is also pretty bad. Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending."
126,Squid Game,"The peer pressure made me watch this. I wish this show came out about 10 years ago as some small part was predictable but was I surprised? Oh boy,I definitely was. Don't need a second season, but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies. This was brilliant!"
127,Squid Game,Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2. Really entertaining we were very roped in the whole time! Emotional at times. Check it out!!
128,Squid Game,Quite a good show starts off quite slow however ur does get better. I found a few parts slow and boring however it does get better. Good story and good characters with a big twist at the end!! Hopefully a 2nd season.
129,Squid Game,I found the first season of squid game quite good however I believe that it is overhyped and everyone made out it was better than it was. The characters were good and the emotional connections were good aswell.
130,Squid Game,"IMO, this is a really well done production. Some aspects get lost in translation (cultural, not language) but it's a well told story, regardless. It's not an original story but a twist on an old classic. What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing. You can't google translate this stuff. It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it's a huge speed bump in the entertainment value. All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves. Well, the ones on screen. The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators.But, what's glaringly obvious is the racial aspect. That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani. But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean. In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western. A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too. So the slurs are intentional. Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement."
131,Squid Game,The description says the players are vying for $45 billion dollars but the amount is really 45 billion Korean won or about $30 million USD.
132,Squid Game,This was an interesting program but not as great as reviewers are making it sound. This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death. Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash. Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.
133,Squid Game,"And I'm hard to please!Being a massive fan of Korean cinema and horror I couldn't help sitting through the first three episodes happily identifying all the obvious influences which were by no means restricted to Korean cinema and horror.So the obvious comparisons with films like Old Boy and the Sympathy with Lady vengeance are there. The deshevilled under class of loan dependent opportunists of Parasite.But then there was the island of the Japanese classic, Battle Royale or the cult British 60's TV series, The Prisoner. Additionally there were the not too subtle pieces of political and social commentary which echoed recent Spanish films, Platform and Cadaver.However, it's no accident that the entire plot of Squid Game revolves around the visually striking staircase that for us art school students of the 90s instantly recognised as the post-modern Memphis style. For me this was a kind nod to the 80s post modernist architectural tradition of borrowing other people's ideas and incorporating it into something new and visually striking.And that's the point at which I stopped caring that Squid Game was in essence a neo-postmodern composite and started enjoying the ride.And what a ride.No spoilers here but suffice to say every episode had me experience the full range of emotions, from dread and anger, sympathy and blood list for revenge, Squid Game is brilliantly crafted.The horror genre nerds might try to dismiss some part of the plot as being derivative, but every one needs to remember that Korean cinema doesn't care about genre.Seriously, take a day off work, order take away food and strap yourself in and watch the whole thing in one day. You won't regret it."
134,Squid Game,"Not me, that's for sure.The first episode was a real slog. We meet a loser and half the episode is beating into our heads he's a loser. We get it. The scene in the underground with the recruiter followed by the birthday with his daughter was plenty of backstory. But no, we get stealing from his mom, failure at the track, encounter with bookies...After that we're introduced a pointless ""game"". Who runs that and to what end? The contestants are unknown so wagering makes no sense. Randomly killing losers makes no sense. Some kind of government thing makes no sense. Gladiator stories like Hunger Games or the Maze series work because the heroes are chosen for their skills. These people were chosen for their lack of skill. Huh?The acting is amateur at best. There isn't one likable character. The ending was shoehorned in to allow for an unexpected season 2.This is so far from watchable for me on so many levels I can only assume I'm not the intended audience. I give it 0 stars, everyone else seems to give it 10. Call it five stars."
135,Squid Game,"What a beautiful surprise we got here, Netflix usually makes cheap content, like in budget and in creativity, but this is one of the few great things Netflix release per year, like The OA or La casa de papel, Ozark etc.The quality of the script is top pitch perfect, as the characters construction, absolutely great games, very unpredictable, and the teams are more like a chess game, it doesn't matter if u have the strongest team in a tug of war, if u have a genius, an old wise man, fearless integrants, you can rock the way out of any situation, this show grew on me, I LOVED IT."
136,Squid Game,"This show's massive popularity, especially among young Netflix viewers, conveniently exposes that audience to the kind of childhood they had all missed out on - playing games outdoors with other neighborhood kids instead of just sitting on the couch watching Netflix. It is pretty clever in that way, yet that is just the beginning, as this show's multi-layered subject matter and plot line are executed so well that ""Squid Game"" guarantees you to be on the edge of your seat. There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch. ""Squid Game"" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like ""Pulp Fiction,"" and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time. With ""Squid Game,"" you will not be wasting time. I guarantee it."
137,Squid Game,"Episode 1 was AMAZING!!!But things went downhill a little bit each episode. By episode 4, I was totally over it.I did watch all 9 episodes, because I'd already invested so much time into it. Plus, I wanted to see what all the social media hype was about...unfortunately, after all 9 episodes, I'm not seeing it.Didn't really need to be 9 hours long...would of worked better as one regular 90-minute film."
138,Squid Game,If you watched any of the most recent dystopian movie likes Hunger Games then you can pretty much figure out that no one is going to win in this. It is made clear that there is only going to be one winner so all the supposed teams are going to end badly so the friendships made are for the sole purpose of making the audience feel something. It kinda does work but it makes you feel manipulated at the same time.This is not a bad show and I can see why people like it. It has all parts to a great Netflix Original but I just felt manipulated while watching it.
139,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a South Korean series on Netflix that blew up recently and got on my radar. Didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews, all I knew was that it was about some ""Game"" and thought it might be like those Japanese game shows or maybe kinda like Wipeout but with a story. That didn't exactly turn out to be the case and I was hooked quickly during the first episode. The series is about a bunch of people knee-deep in troubles joining a game where they compete for a massive cash prize where the penalty for failure is extreme.Boasting multiple characters that you get to know over the course of the season, all backed up by wonderful performances from the cast, getting invested in the story comes easy. They are a varied bunch and the way the series is directed and paced, you pretty much feel as if you're going through this ordeal alongside them. The psychological manipulation that the organization has set up for them and trying to see what you would have done in the situation only adds to the entertainment.I loved how the creator of the series took mostly common games that a lot of us probably have played sometimes in our childhoods and turned them macabre. With good direction and well-paced flow, the tension was often racked up to a great degree and the more you get attached to certain characters, the more intense it got, sometimes being outright brutal and gut-wrenching (I'm looking at you Episode 6). The games never got boring nor did they get repetitive as there would mostly be some twists and turns added into the mix.It also doesn't hurt the experience that this feels like a big production and not what you'd expect from a ""Game"" series. Apart from a few shoddy CGI shots which can easily be dismissed, most of it looked and sounded great.However, the series does falter a bit in the second half where, for spoilers sake, let's just say some things get revealed and they are what you'd boringly expect and probably have predicted early on. On top of that, the performances in that chunk, especially relative to the performances from the rest of the cast, just weren't good. Would have wished they kept things in the dark more, keep the air of mystery or have a bit more meat. Good thing it doesn't ruin the series nor does it impact the overall story a great deal which does end on a high note with social commentary and messaging that one can enjoy.Overall, props to Hwang Dong-hyuk, the Writer and Director, who after a long journey of being rejected by so many areas finally got to make his series and it's heartwarming to see it get so popular and receive praise and his hard work pay off immensely, so Never Give Up I guess. Unless you're squeamish and can't handle rough stuff, I'd highly recommend this series to everyone, but chances are you have already seen it. Had a great time with it. Wherever they decide to take the story next, I'll certainly am looking forward to it. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it an 8.5/10."
140,Squid Game,"The show has an interesting storyline - you can draw various metaphors (about society, capitalism) if you want to, or simply watch something with a different concept. The writing does enough to make you care about the characters.The acting was brilliant overall! Camera work, color correction/editing & set design were AMAZING and the music was great.All that said, I don't think it's mind blowing. Parts of the show that others LOUVE you may just like or you won't mind. Don't let that get in the way of your decision to watch the show or not. I think you should not miss out on it. The show is also brutal, dark and might be disturbing but still very entertaining."
141,Squid Game,"I heard so much hype for this so I was excited to watch. I did enjoy the first episodes a lot and was really positively surprised with diverse characters like Ali and Sae Byeok. I wish we got more depth to her and surely she would have had very interesting background/flashbacks. I wish there had been more winners honestly, cos i thought multiple winners were possible. The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche."
142,Squid Game,"I only started watching because it pretty much blew up on the internet and it got me curious, and wow. I really didn't expect much from this but I was proven wrong really quickly. The basis of this show is something we're all familiar with: wealth inequality and the lines people are forced to and will cross for money, and it was the literal version of 'a rich man's playground'. The poor were just things for him to play with, for some fun and excitement. Anyway, the range of emotions I felt while watching the episodes was enough to leave me somewhat exhausted, but in a good way. Really, I gotta hand it to the team that worked on this because it was clearly a high budget and high quality production. Also, I know it's pretty rare for Korean shows to have more than 1 season, but that ending was hinting at a 2nd season, wasn't it?"
143,Squid Game,"While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don't expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga ""Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji"", which has been running from 1996. It's been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing ""Squid Game"".The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this ""inspiration"".There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. ""Squid Game"" definitely satisfies in this department, although it's not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong's ""Burning"" (2018) or the Oscar-winning ""Parasite"". But the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if Bong Joon-ho would do a superhero movie called ""The Vengeancers""."
144,Squid Game,"The Good:I don't give 10s out lightly. Squid Game deserves this score because there is NOTHING else that came out in 2021 that became a cultural phenomenon like this one. No astroturfing, no manufactured hype. A genuine global phenomenon that emerged organically. How about that?Squid Game is television at its absolutely finest. I can't tell you the last time I was immediately transfixed by a show and captivated from beginning to end. Where do I even start with this?The incredible characters, who are more human and realistic than 99% of the people we ever see on screen? The incredible layered writing that gives each person such depth and complexity? The performances, which are so powerful and excellent, that the cast became overnight global celebrities? The pacing of the show which - save for episode 8 - is basically perfect? The twists and turns, shocking reveals and incredible easter eggs layered throughout? The tension generated from a brutal, misanthropic world that nevertheless has a twisted sense of morality and fairness? The iconic visuals? The set and costume design that keeps these images in your head long after you've seen the show?The exciting, diverse and incredible set pieces? How an episode about marbles - literally the least visually compelling game in the series - is universally declared one of the best episodes of television ever produced? Or how the first game grabs you and immediately sums up the ethos of the entire show?What about the heavy themes, which delve deep into explorations of human nature, greed, solidarity; that reflect contemporary anxieties about income inequality in South Korea (and increasingly, the world)? Hell, this and Parasite have solidified South Korea as a cultural superpower and honestly, if I were Korean, I would be extremely proud. The Korean Wave is going to be a tsunami.I can go on and on about what this show does well: how you can spend hours dissecting it, how it balances extremely dark and sadistic subject matter with humanity, tenderness and humour, how it subverts expectations the RIGHT WAY. It's a 10.The Bad: Perfection doesn't truly exist. And if I wanted to really pick out a flaw, it's Episodes 7 and 8. I'll touch on the VIPs after, but all-in-all, Episode 7 is still a great episode. It just adds some elements (like narration), that I didn't see as necessary. Episode 8 is an emotional wrecking ball, but it's weirdly short and kind of out of place.The Ugly: Okay, so the major criticism I've been seeing has been the performances and dialog of the VIPs. Notwithstanding the difficulty of finding fluent, non-Korean English speakers in South Korea, directing them (whilst not speaking the same language) and writing English dialog as a non-English speaker, the VIPs are highly intentional.Squid Game does not portray the wealthy upper class as an elite group of hyper sophisticated, intelligent people. This is probably a more realistic depiction: they're crude, callous, cringe inducing and save for their wealth, pathetic people. The casting of Gong Yoo and Lee Byung-Hun - who are basically Brad Pitt/Leo DiCaprio levels of famous in South Korea - was meant to imply that the wealthy retain these handsome, sophisticated men to project an elite status. But it doesn't exist. In reality, these are just douchebags.That the mind behind all of this is, well, the last person you'd expect, but in reality, would be the MOST LIKELY to do something like this, drives this point home even more.In summation. Either you've watched Squid Game or not at this point. It's a masterpiece. It's the best content I've seen all year. Just watch it and make up your own mind."
145,Squid Game,"When I first heard about Squid Game I thought it was really out there. After watching it, I still have that belief. I like the premise of Squid Game, and I think most of the show is pretty good. The games are fun, you learn to care about the players, and the setting is eerie. I did not really understand the whole organ harvesting side plot, and it seemed unnecessary. The twist at the end was pretty good, but relating everything back to betting on horses was not a good comparison. I'm excited to see if this show will return for another season."
146,Squid Game,"Long time viewer of both Netflix and K-dramas, and this one is a fantastic blend of the best of both. The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?"
147,Squid Game,"As far as I get this it's an amazing concept of mixing real lives and childhood games. So, excited about the 2nd season of this. All the best. Thank you."
148,Squid Game,"Well, before everybody was not talking about, I started to watch, it is different but I really don't understand why this happened so popular in everywhere. I watched better things from Korea. It is nice and different, simple games, good characterizations but for me there is a logical error, everybody hasn't equal standards in the game and we cannot talk about equality or justice. In an episode there was a dialog about that.. Anyway, it is nice and watchable."
149,Squid Game,"Strength, agility, cunning and dexterity nothing count in Squid Game, the value of human life is practically zero.Even luck doesn't count for anything.You compete in the game with '' free will '' even if in a society where resources are controlled by a few and most people need resources to be fulfilled, free will is just a chimera.The main flaw that I noticed in the nine episodes is the predictability, you immediately understand who the protagonists are and they will go on in the rehearsals and in the episodes and vice versa you immediately understand who is part of the extras and their life will last very little, not only because extras do not have any kind of background but also from the visual frames reserved for them very approximate compared to the protagonists.For a series like this there had to be at least 20 other main actors where every time they '' disappeared '' they gave an emotional effect to the viewer."
150,Squid Game,"Can't say that I saw many Korean movies but on occasion they certainly produce a special and unique pieces of cinema that deserve attention of everyone.First I want to say that I didn't like the main protagonist. His gambling addiction really puts you off. As the series progress you see his better qualities which make you sympathize, but still he thought he was cunning the old man in the 4th game.I felt sorry for good hearted Ali, who wasn't that smart and was completely and absolutely loyal to the end.It made very little sense to me how the bodies sbaching operation could be done under the nose of a front man and at the same time involve a lot people from the staff. Such operation could not become unnoticed.I've noticed the cop's phone was about 60% charged at the beginning, so hiw did ge kept his battery until the end?The old man's identity was known to middle staff (soldiers), which didn't made much sense.In any case it's a good one and worth to check out."
151,Squid Game,"Absolutely fabulous! Truly fabulous. I was terribly bummed to read so many reviews that claim the subtitle translation was bad; as an English-only speaker, proper translations are paramount. I never watch English language dubs as they are horrible compared to watching (and hearing real characters voicing their parts) in the original language with the subtitles on.In all honesty, this likely would have been a '10' had it not been for some slow areas in episodes 1, 2, & 9. That's not to say that they were bad, but there is a necessity for backstory that is handled in these episodes (or post-story, re: ep9) and to me there were some wasted opportunities. Nonetheless, the show is definitely binge worthy. I went through it in two days and am hopeful they'll do another season.Extremely well produced, a super cool mix of fantasy, action, and drama with a novel story line. But hey...what's up with Lee Byung-hun not being credited in IMDB for his cameo as The Frontman? I get that the ""walking around"" character didn't need to be Byung-hun, but it was such a surprise to see his face behind the mask that he needs to be credited."
152,Squid Game,"Nothing new here but it's quite well done and engaging. There's more story and character development than you might expect from this story and that keeps it from just being generic. As with many shows, the English dubbing is bad: if recommend original Korean with subtitles. One nice thing is that because this is a series and not a movie, they're able to dig into the backstories more and that makes it more engaging and interesting than this may have otherwise been. A great addition to the genre."
153,Squid Game,"Squid game feels like it's a mixture of the game show Takeshi's Castle, and the films Hunger Games, and Battle Royale!A bunch of people down on their luck playing a number of childrens games for the chance to win a large sum of money. Sounds very basic but the series is anything but, there are twists and turns all the way through, and the penalty for losing a game is....severe.There are a number of sub plots, and whilst some of those events are slightly predictable, the vast majority are not. Squid Game is like Game of Thrones in that no matter which characters you like, it's probable that they aren't going to make it to the end alive.The series maintains a high level of intrigue and tension throughout as you eagerly wait to find out what the next challenge is, and learn more about the operation behind the games. It is highly stylised and quite a few of the scenes come across as they've been taken straight out the pages of a graphic novel...all this means is that it looks great!Situations bring out the worst in people mostly, but also sometimes the best in people, as characters choose to work together or betray each other to make it to the end. Sometimes you don't want to watch, but somehow you can't look away.The climax was quite satisfying if not perfect, and it leaves the series open to a second season....can't wait!"
154,Squid Game,"Violent and imaginative, the SG is fun to watch.People struggle with money and get a chance to play kids games turned deadly in a misterious place were everyone wears masks. Ruthless, people start to die in each game until one is left. Wich one?"
155,Squid Game,This show hooks you in from the start!!!! It makes you care about these characters and you form an attachment to them!!! The message and theme of this show is so powerful and relevant. I love this show so much!!
156,Squid Game,"An outstanding piece of Korean Television drama. If you can see it with the subtitles and not the dubbed version, do so. As others have said the dubbed version is atrocious.This literally is as I have described above. A motley group of Koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death.Nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part. What do they all have in common? Poverty or huge debts or both. The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face. (One man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)There are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals.I don't want to say more for fear of spoilers. Definitely worth your time."
157,Squid Game,I binge-watched this one. Every episode was so addictive and tense.All episodes were very emotionnal. Then we reached the conclusion and.... what a letdown. Huge anti-climatic ending.I would still recommend watching it.
158,Squid Game,Watched the whole thing in a day after hearing bout it from others and some guy going its way way way out there the games like I would never have seen before!? SO NOT TRUE the plot story even plant was all Very predictable and we've seen these escape death tournaments a hundred times before usually in a just movie length and with bigger faster action so really this should just be youre average 5 but I gave a extra point as the actors are good . And it does do as a good enough past time. Its just not something that needed to be a series.
159,Squid Game,"Watch the first episode if you can't resist the marketing hype. You'll see it's a 3/4. But since these few points - due to the fresh storyline - are undeserved (it's heavily inspired by the manga-anime Kaiji, and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies), I'll give it a 1.Abysmal overacting, puppet characters, unrealistic and unrefined stuff. Even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it's trash."
160,Squid Game,"Thrilling, astonishing and deceptive at the same time. Shockingly violent and discomforting but lacks of strength in the end."
161,Squid Game,"Everyone is talking about squid game so I will give it a go...turns out the plot is right up my street! Korean children's games where if they lose they die! Really original and fresh.Ep1 - you see most of this in the trailer but it really is one of the best episodes. Red light green light iconic.Ep2 - bit slow but building towards something
Ep3 - honeycomb ep really good
Ep4 - allegiances form and tug of war
Ep5 - didn't really enjoy the harvesting organs doctor plot
Ep 6 -gganbu ep big names die in this and it's really coming towards the end now!Ep7 - glass bridge ep really good and lots more big names die
Ep8 - short ep where it leads to the crescendo in ep 9 where main character ends up winning however some of his choices are frustrating. For example not trying to win the game at the end and also when he does win doesn't make the most of the money. It finally looks as if he is going sorting his life out and then he doesn't get on the plane!!! (And for some reason decided to get a really strange haircut which doesn't really suit him!)So much potential and I really hope there's a series two!"
162,Squid Game,"Series are wonderful ones to watch because they sow curious elements into the mind of the audience when they finish the episodes one by one. There was something striking in each episode that urges the viewers to go for the next one. Squid Game is similar to that, it is like a typical Web/TV series that has that flavor in every episode. I'm an ardent fan of Korean movies because of the way of representation and the choosing of subjects they are portraying. Squid Game is the first Korean series I am watching that also provides that kind of Korean fragrance. It's about games not only one game but also the children's game popular among in Korea. The basic core of the movie is the need for money and the problems and struggles followed by the low-class section of the Korean community. The series gets more engaged when the contestants participate in the game. And the game is something like a survival one because those who failed in the game will be killed. It is a do-or-die action for them. Initially, there were 456 contestants and when the game progresses the number gets decreased and the amount in the piggy bank becomes increases. When the last man survives he gets an amount of 45.6 billion won as a reward. This might be the capsule plot behind Squid Game. There might arise a lot of questions regarding this capsule plot. Who conducts these survival games? What did they get while conducting these games? Is it legal or illegal? Like this, you'll have many more doubts and questions regarding Squid Game. If you watched the series you'll have that clear answer with you and if you are not watched it yet then go and watch this wonderful series. You'll surely get engaged."
163,Squid Game,"This might be the first major injection of Battle Royale style stories into mass media ... I think what differentiates Squid Game from other similar shows is that characters are mostly poor people with massive debts, just like most of the world I guess, unlike school kids in Battle Royale or Student aged kids in Alice in Borderland or a gaming nerd in Btoom ... The show is properly high budget , the acting is decent and the script is good, what makes the show appeal to masses, just like Lost when it came out, not many realized it's a rehashed for masses Earth 2."
164,Squid Game,"I can see why so many people like this series. Although I gave up on it at the start of episode 2 I can see that it exudes quality. It does so many of the things well that you expect from Korean drama, most particularly the actors delivering their roles with absolute conviction.But, for me at least, the story line is too dark, the view of the human condition too bleak, for this to be an entertainment. Korea does so many uplifting dramas, romantic comedies and moving tragedies for me to avoid watching those for any longer than I have to."
165,Squid Game,"Show was lame, very weirdly paced and slow. It wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee. Dont follow the hype either. Idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there. Alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense. You dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show. This show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as BR. Skip this or watch if your bored."
166,Squid Game,"This is a modernized version of the disintegration of people in front of audiences that has attracted people's attention since Roman times. Games are simple children's games. Players are people struggling in financial grip and unable to find a way out. Prize money awarded to the winner makes the man skip a few classes. In the first stage, 456 people are invited to the game. We focus on 8 of them. The remaining 448 people will die simply extras. 5 of these 8 people are doing tricks to win the money.Even if we accept the logic of the script itself, allowing people to kill each other when the game is not being played. Ignoring people even if they have illegal things on them. Freeing cheating. Employees being blunt and telling every secret, the nation's organ trade inside and not being caught in such a technological place, not smelling cigarettes, etc. Etc.The series continued with curiosity until the last episode. The last episode dropped the whole mode and evolved into a more ridiculous ending. What they thought they were supposedly hiding was evident in the 6th episode. It would be a surprise if it wasn't.The series seemed to me as a combination of movies such as (see: 13 tzameti), (see: das experiment), (see: the belko experiment)."
167,Squid Game,"With all the hype around it I was very interested in this series, but found myself somewhat disappointed. Yes, it is interesting enough to keep watching, but actually it is not that special. Yes there are some interesting plot twists but again, not really shocking. It is all a basic conflict of bonding with people that all go for the money, where apparently our hero is the only one with some moral feelings. The storyline with the detective did not add much and the VIPs were silly. The gangster is very stereotype and silly.There is a uprising in Korean series, this one is ok, but not special. ""Memories of the Alhambra"" and ""Sysiphus"" are much more intelligent in their script."
168,Squid Game,"Can Watchable in One Sitting , Binge Worthy Show from Netflix."
169,Squid Game,"I watched Episode 1 on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series, and they were absolutely right. I was captured right away. The series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing. Beware, cause there is more than enough violence in the series, and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters, at the same time that you despise others. Keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events. You probably won't see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often. The best thing about this series is the acting. My mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances. There are true Emmy or Oscar level performances throughout the show. One of the best series I've watched in a long time."
170,Squid Game,"This is a great show at first i thought ""Squid Game"" what a awful name but i got tons of good recommendations to watch it so i did and it was GREAT!!! Acting was good and the plot wad always aligned you can pretty much but two and two together towards the end if your smart but for most who can your in for a big surprise anyway good show. I recommend all to watch this masterpiece."
171,Squid Game,"I had a problem to stay with the show in multiple episodes where the tempo suddenly changes and it becomes rather uneventful, predictable and boring. I know, it tries to bring in some emotional moments (sometimes successfully ).Korean acting style is often over the top, but in this series it fits in as it should bring out the stressful environment. Still, sometimes annoying.Overall I liked it, but mostly I just wanted to know what happens next regardless of the actors or performances. Events in the plot are more significant than anything else. I am glad I avoided any spoilers before watching this, otherwise I think I would just quit mid episode 1."
172,Squid Game,"This series has many of the elements that made Saw and The Hunger Games great, with enough unique iconic elements to earn its place as an instant classic in its own right. It makes you care about its rich, developing characters, played by charismatic and convincing actors. It masterfully balances extreme suspense with gruesome outcomes, but it also sneaks in endearing and comedic scenes when you least expect it. It makes insightful social commentary about subjects such as extreme financial disparities. It addresses depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. It features creative set design, props, costumes, and music that have already become the inspiration for countless memes. It will spur various conversations with your friends about all of these subjects and more."
173,Squid Game,The inclusion of the cheesy acting and writing in the VIP segment in the middle of so much quality work was the koreans trying to broaden american interest by recreating the cheesy acting and writing usually popular in american action movies...
174,Squid Game,"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake.Season 1 : 9 episodesTop series for this year by far , the Idea💡 , the execution of the story 👏 , it shows how far need can take you and how greedy humans can be .My rating : 9/10 , IMDB : 8.2/10."
175,Squid Game,"This will be your thorough start-to-end review. I am going to mention that this series got right, and everything it got wrong. I am rating it a 5 overall. It's a solid 8 for the first 5 episodes, and just ONE star for the remaining episodes. You'll understand why.And in advance, excuse me for my not-so-good English. (Im not native).Overview:
This series was a risk to take, the director knows that very well. It's very bloody, and the centerpiece of the plot deals with a rather sensitive idea. It was no problem because it was handled as it should be, not perfectly but, it was good and enjoyable, until it started falling apart and the bad outweighed the good.The Good:
The idea is great. If you have watched this series, you must have a faint idea about why this had so much buzz in such a short time. The whole concept of ""Hunger Games"" style, being played by the wealthy but not forced to do so, as well as the kids' game as their theme, did pretty well in the first episodes. It was fair, square, and it lived up to its own concept.There were stereotypical characters, and others really well-written, the entire cast is great, memorable, and there are characters who you would root for. All characters had a common thing between them, financial misery, and that money can solve all problems, yet they had some depth to them. It's not the best character writing but it sure did the job.The atmosphere was so great during the first 5 episodes, you can actually LIVE in the shoes of the characters, you can see what they see, you can feel it, you start actually relating to them. It's all great, it's what the series is meant to do.The acting for most characters was great, the dialogue is smart (I watched it in fan-subs, as the original subs didn't do it for me).The Bad:
The main character is kind of ""stale"" to me, it's not really someone I'd care about, he is a loser, and he is set out to be one all the series but he ends up winning just like that, he gets this psychological breakdown after he wins, but it just feels so not right. The main character is just wrong. I am pretty sure everyone shares the same opinion. It's not about the actor, but the director didn't really get so clever about managing his MC's façade it felt flat.It becomes predictable towards EP 6: You start wishing something unpredictable happens. Most characters just die during the 4th and 5th game, and there's not much to see after that.It deviates from its concept: Kids game, right? That's what made the first 4 games great, as soon as they deviated from that logic, it started feeling like a different series, ones we didn't sign up for, nor did we want.The Ugly:
Remember the policeman who played spy to look for his brother? Such a really long side-plot for what? We watched him infiltrate the island but for what? He gets shot off by his own brother, nothing happens afterwards. We sure haven't seen him die but something about the entire side plot should've happened during the first season because it took a lot of screentime of the FIRST season. Simply leaving it for a second season after it took so much time from the first season is just ridiculous and kind of greedy. Also, being shot by his own brother is really cliché.VIPs: This is a grand ""kek"", they were just very bad and a pain to watch. Nothing about them really adds anything to the series, they had so much potential, and the air of mystery about them faded away poorly as soon as they started talking nonsense. I get the director wanted us to hate them, but this bittered the drinkNothing gets resolved: This is the big downside of the entire series: So WHAT. They want to enforce the fact the money doesn't buy happiness, it does buy happiness. But that's not the point, because the contestants CHOSE to partake in the blood fest. Yet somehow the MC kept whining and whining seeing people die. What the hell? You signed up for it, you get what you wished for, lolz.Last game is a buzzkill: They should've come up with a better 1 on 1 game. It was already a big let-down when they killed off the girl like that, but seriously? Suicide? After all he went through ? So freaking stupid.The last 3 episodes just killed a lot of braincells in my head. It felt like the director and the writers just turned the switch of thinking in their brain OFF. I couldn't help but feel so bad for not just skipping to the end of the last episode.All in all, it was fun to start with, and kind of an ultimate disappointment in the end. But it's still good, totally worth your time but no way in hell does it come close to the best 100 series ever."
176,Squid Game,"If you haven't seen Battle Royale, Gantz, As the Gods Will, Alice in Borderland and other japanese series, you will be amazed. I only watched with pain the 1st episode. It went slowly to the good part and I will continue watching. But it doesn't deserve the credit of its predecessors and whatever comes in next episodes will not make me change my mind."
177,Squid Game,"This one isn't popular because it's groundbreaking or going where television hasn't been before, but because of the story it's telling. Korean television/cinema has had a big boom among Western audiences in the last few years and I'm glad to see it because they do create wonderful media and are excellent storytellers. Squid Game, however, isn't any different from what the Japanese offered us through Battle Royale some decades prior but given the current socio/political climate we're living in, this show was released at just the right time.Ultimately, it's a critique on capitalism and how it dehumanizes people. We see how far a person will go just to have a fat wallet. I think the show does a good job at tackling this topic by showing the negative effects this greed has on people. We see how some working class people get lost in their pursuit of insane wealth to the point of financial ruin and how some of the wealthy elite have so much money than they know what to do with so they decide to bet on working class people like one would do on horses - a comparison that is made in the show.The characters we follow who join the games are all in financial ruin and desperately need money to pay off their debts. The first episode gives us the backstory of the main protagonist, Gi-Hun and the second one gives us glimpses into the lives of the other main characters whom the show will focus on as the games progress. The initial antagonist character among them, the gangster guy, is your stereotypical bad guy. Bullying everyone in the facility, cheating, beating a guy to death - he meets all the ""bad guy is bad"" stereotypes. Our protagonist isn't perfect but he has a good heart and seems to be one of only a few who has a decent moral compass. The latter being debatable with the choice he makes at the end, but we'll get there in a moment.The way each episode is written, you know that Gi-Hun is going to end up winning the game no matter what. Although this irritated me a bit because of how predictable it was, they do manage to hit with shocks and surprises despite the obvious outcome. Since there are various main characters we were following, you begin to root for several of them, most notably Sae-Byeok, Ali, and Player 001. So when these characters lose the game, it does have an emotional impact to those who get invested in the story which seems to be everyone, really. In that respect, the show succeeds at making people feel something and at times left in shock despite how predictable. An interesting balance to strike but Squid Game does it. I don't think anything sets the viewer up for the big plot twist at the end, sadly I was expecting it because it got spoiled for me - it's hard not to have this show spoiled with how popular it is on social media. However, it is quite a big twist that actually really brings the critique at the center of this story home.Now my issues with this show have to do with it's B plot and the awful VIP's that were introduced near the end of the games. The B plot is that of a detective that sneaks his way onto the boat when the players decide to return and continue playing the game. He makes it pretty far in his mission to investigate and expose these sadistic games but the climax for this plot is very underwhelming. I guess the game master or head henchman turns out to be the detective's brother and this revelation is what makes the detective give up, so he lets himself be shot and killed. Maybe they were trying to accomplish something with this plot, this one did manage to keep me in suspense and the ending upset me - while the predictable main plot kept me in some suspense but really got me with its ending. I suppose I'll be further unpacking that one. It might not be that deep though and just be speedy storytelling when it comes to the B plot.Now for the complaint that seems to be everyone else's, the awful VIP's. I wouldn't have an issue with the appearance of these characters if it wasn't for the horrid way they were acted out. The voices were too irritating to hear, every time they came out and spoke, I felt like the minutes dragged on. The dialogue for them was awful too. Now it's possible it was written by someone who's first language isn't English, but the actors (who I assume are native English speakers) couldn't pitch in and amend that ? Well what can you expect from them when the acting was atrocious. I read online that the actors were asked to perform this way but intentional as it may be, it was irritating and really dragged down the show in my opinion. They were a cheesy addition to the show. I get they're necessary to the plot, but had they been performed differently, in a less ""1960's cartoon villain"" way then they would've been on par with the rest of the show. I think speaking in normal voices and saying sentences that normal people say, would've made it much more sadistic. I mean that's the theme throughout the show.All in all, I enjoyed the series. I wasn't fond with the ending showing the character deciding to go back and expose the game, instead of going to see his kid - and he's the hero we were supposed to root for ? Guess that's to set us up for season 2, but I think this show works better if there's new characters each season and if they must bring back the main character, he could come back after taking care of important things. Still, I will definitely be watching season 2 when it's available. Believe it or not I'm actually happy this is as popular as it is, it means people are becoming more aware of the reality we're living in."
178,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a South Korean survival drama. I started watching the series after seeing the trailer thinking of it as a cool fun adventure thriller, instead, it turned out to be more of a hard-hitting human story. It has so much depth for a survival series genre which is mainly known for brutality and gore, which it has in plenty, but also adds to it with the writing having heart-wrangling social commentary.The writing and direction are class, the casting spot on, the music, set pieces as well as camera angle really add to the thrill. The only complaint I have is, it was two episodes too long, dragged in the middle."
179,Squid Game,Man who made this and this is so emotional when grandpa knew he was cheating but gave it all up saying ganbu buddies stay and share together and so was ali who paid a price for his innocence.I wished like every show the good guys has a chance but no this one is realistic as hell.On episode 6 made me cry i miss my dad seeing gramps .Bruh they got me in the first half I'm not gonna spoil the spoiler but I did cry for nothing.
180,Squid Game,"After finishing the show today (I braced myself not to watch it all in one sitting) and without reading spoilers (but recognising many of the hints), I think this show is liked and disliked for the wrong reasons by many.I don't know what Koreans think of the show, but have quite a few Asian friends who liked it. It's always been a bit funny to me, because most Asians I know NEVER seem interested in their continents movies or shows and prefer Hollywood.Personally, I think Hollywood is about as bad as it can be (at least I hope it can't get even worse) and there's almost nothing for me.Since the late 90s, Japan and Korea (also Brazil and Mexico) have done quite a few amazing movies.Korea with Brotherhood, OldBoy, the brilliant Shiri/Swiri, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and the very twisty ""The Wailing"" (Squid Game reminded me of that, although they are about different topics),
Japan with gems like Swallowtail Butterfly, Love Exposure, Confessions, to name only a few.Many of the mediocre or bad reviews complain about things that show that they never watched Asian movies and can't seem to get into the culture.One example is the character of Min-Yeo.Sure, on the surface, she's a manipulative lady, seemingly just cruel and selfish. But I was rather shocked to see how many people consider her to be just as bad as the gangster.The actress gave an interview and said she actually felt very bad for her character and that her character, though nasty and feisty is actually just very afraid and alone. We can see that in her own way, how she wants to ""belong"". Think how she learned to use her body or anything to ""entice"" men. Such behavior is usually learned from a traumatic childhood. I really would have loved to know her backstory and hope we will get to know more about her in season 2.I actually didn't hate ANY of the characters. Many said they couldn't sympathize or like any of the characters, but I didn't feel that way. Good or bad, they all had their two sides. The only exceptions are probably Daek-Su and the VIPs, but they are that way for a reason. Heck, there were times in the beginning when I even felt a little bad for Daek-Su.I think Squid Game is trying to show us that we are all neither good or bad people by nature. It's our actions that make us either good or bad.Comparisons to movies like the Hunger Games (yuk!) or Battle Royale don't seem very fitting. One reviewer mentions Oldboy, but I don't see that either. Oldboy and the trilogy around it is about revenge. Squid Game is NOT about revenge. It's more about human nature and how chasing after money is not fulfilling and that money does NOT bring us happiness.Don't you think most of these characters would gladly forfeit all that money if they could bring back the people they lost? Our hero sure doesn't seem happy about his winnings.And Battle Royale... it's similar in a sense that it pits everyone vs everyone, but it's all about punishment. Squid Game isn't about punishment either. Nobody is forced to participate. Heck, even before they cross the glass bridge or any other game, the players ALWAYS have the option to call it quits. It's their greed or desperation that keeps them going. And in some cases, their lack of perspective.Although the big twists are not really a surprise if you watch out for some hints that give them away, I think this has been a very good show. I think the reason it's been so successful is that although it is almost ""normal"" for Korean or Asian movies to ""not end happy"", Western audiences aren't used to it. Surely had this been an American show, the hero wouldn't have learned anything and just spent the money and have a sugary happy ending.The fact that it doesn't end in such a ""perfect"" (and thus unnatural) way is why I like Asian storytelling more. It's just more like actual life."
181,Squid Game,"One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is ""Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake"". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?Firstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.I also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.Another reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother's card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don't feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game.Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not."
182,Squid Game,"I've watched the whole lot and it's just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all. I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It's really woeful."
183,Squid Game,"A nice drama but with bad unrealistic endings in the last 2/9 episodes. The VIPs are rotten wasting stories!The starting is smooth nice to the middle but as it get long, it became average interesting only. If they did not conclude so so simply made endings, I will give 9/10. I can only give 8/10 which is considered good to watch. Furthermore, it's only 9 episodes so luckily not a long drama because the last 2 episodes were too awfully produced."
184,Squid Game,"I liked it but the last few episodes were too slow so I had to watch them at 1.5X speed. All in all, it is an odd and entertaining series nicely designed but not as unique as some claim. I do not know if the actors were poorly directed, if they are bad at acting or if it is a cultural thing but I thought many of the characters were overacting.If you have seen The Hostel franchise, Funhouse, The Maze Runner, Battle Royale, the Saw franchise, you will recognize a lot in this series. However, Squid Game stands out with its colorful design and imaginative theme and I liked it. Definitely worth a shot."
185,Squid Game,"It's really not that good, highly predictable and the ending was terrible.I will say though, the main character and his acting wasn't too bad, enjoyed watching him, but other than that, it's a waste of time.Anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series."
186,Squid Game,"First of, I am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-English movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world.The concept of Squid Game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives.The main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no VFX are used and the sets were actually built.It starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there's some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds.As we get to the finale however that's a different story, not only it's an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn't make much sense based on the previous events..Without giving any spoilers, the main twist it's not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show.Also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds.Still I did enjoy it for the most part, I don't think it's overhyped, they could've made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless."
187,Squid Game,"If you've already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you're gonna be disappointed.The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising.And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas....
The plot with the VIP was already seen many times and it felt awkward and ridiculous. And the rest was over dramatic and the ""plot twists""/reveals so typical...
I felt like I've wasted my time with this series...."
188,Squid Game,"""Squid Game Dethroned In Netflix's Top 10 List By A New Show"" It should have never reached the top 10 list in the first place! The show sucks! Two episodes of this silliness and I was done!"
189,Squid Game,"I think any review and ratings for movies is reflective of the theme of this series itself. Is this series worth 10? Clearly no. But many will give it 10 for 2 reasons.1) Gore addicts. 2) Go with the hype.In a clear objective analysis. This series started out extremely good, original, and with very deeply moving and captivating backstories. However by about mid point, like many other series, they ran out of ideas and became cliche, just another Hunger Game, Saw, etc... remake.That being said, for the first part at least, I would give it a 10. The 2nd 1/2, is clearly a 5 and a balance of 7 to 7.5. Rounding down because of certain plot holes and inconsistencies which I will address here.1) Most of the game staff's reactions through the series were puzzling and inaccurate. Everyone signed a contract and death waiver, so technically speaking, everything they were doing was legal. So why were they afraid of the police? Why overly secret? The scene when the front man realized a police was in his office, he pulled out a gun to hunt him. Why? They technically did nothing wrong. If anything, pulling out a gun to threaten the police made them wrong.This was clearly demonstrated in episode 2 that they even allowed the players to vote out of playing. They had no fear of any legal repercussion, yet then why rest of the series they were so worried about it? It is an error in their fundamental logic of the script.2) A lot of Koreans preached about how this is a series addressing income inequality in South Korea, maybe the whole capitalist world. Yet, in the film, every single player was there for a reason and not because they were victims. The main protagonist himself gambled away his money, despite having bad luck in the employment. He may not have a luxurious life, but his massive debt came from gambling and borrowing money from loan sharks.His best friend was even worse, a white collar criminal that embezzled from his clients, created fraudulent documents, etc... from ""bad investments."" Cough cough, you mean pyramid schemes? From his character throughout the series, he was not a moral man, and revealed to be a psychopath. So he was there despite the fact he was not from the lower part of the wealth range.3) The night time massacre scene was either one of the most brilliant writing in this series or the worst, depending on whether it was intentional by the writers. What am I talking about?Either the writers blundered and just wrote in this cliche plot line of how people will turn on each other for money, to survive, and what not. Or ... it was deliberate to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the game system.Throughout the game, the gamer staff dictated an ""equal"" environment of 2nd chance, not only so, but one heavily and meticulously kept accountable. When they found out 1 player was cheating with the staff, they were eliminated and made examples of. Not only so, they observed their 3 fundamental rules so tightly, they even allowed them to vote out the game in episode 2.So the riot scene was out of place, either as a writers' blunder again in the inconsistency of the script, or it was brilliantly put in to demonstrate the hypocrisy of their so called game. They claim to have strict equal rules, even a democratic process, but in the end, used monetary incentive, greed, and starvation to thin the herd when necessary and to turn the players against each other rather than against the game staff. Players were suppose to play the games and be eliminated through the games, not murdered in their sleep. There was no accountability when that 1st man was murdered and as such created hostile environment rather than the promise of fair play.All of the sudden, the chance to vote out as a majority disappeared as the players were no longer divided into 2 groups, yes and no, but into multiple self-interested groups. This is... the heart of socialism, which might all along be the author's intent.If it is... it is brilliantly done. Why?Take a step back and look at all 9 episodes. This is what it means then.In the capitalist world, there are winners and losers, there is a wealth gap. What socialism does, is preach to those who failed in the capitalist world, by their own hands, and a promise of a ""2nd chance,"" a better system, under the pretense of equality, a democratic process, accountability, and social order.However, in reality, all of this was done at gun point and the people, though voluntarily there, were there without choice because their alternative is go back to their failed life in the capitalist system. The socialist system itself is a deception, instead of order, they actually created chaos and pits people against people through greed, starvation, and manipulation. The people, which originally had a choice to democratically end it, then becomes enemies towards each other, losing sight of the real enemy that put them there in the first place. In the end, even if you win in a socialist system, like the protagonist, you really lose. The only real winners? Are the socialist creators.This is socialism's core, what happened in many countries throughout history such as North Korea, China, Venezuela, and what is happening now in many western worlds, including the USA."
190,Squid Game,"Was curious to what the hype at office was over this series. Now I understand. I agree with reviewer, rubberduckydca, to save myself the need to echo the exact same sentiments and more. Holy molly, Hollywood, watch out. Great entertainment, though, a tat bit blood curling disturbing."
191,Squid Game,"The middle of the season is gripping and exciting without being a cheesy horror series. That said, the beginning drags on a bit and I was looking at my phone at times waiting for it to get good.And the ending was nice but felt like the writers didn't know what they were doing and made stuff up as they went along."
192,Squid Game,"Terrible performances from the VIPs, but not enough to ruin that fantastic tv series. This is marathon worthy: I couldn't stop watching until the end. More than the sick games, the mistery behind the main plot was engaging and the end was surprising."
193,Squid Game,"This show had the potential to be one of the best foreign mini series ever streamed world wide, maybe it is for some but not for me since the flaws it kept having but covered by the unexpectd shocking events and great actors, the final episode is the reason not to give this show a 9 or 10, the worst plot twist ever happened and ruined it to be a perfect masterpiece, season 2 isn't necessary but seems like it's happening anyway."
194,Squid Game,"I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It's not just filthy rich making poor fight.I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it."
195,Squid Game,"*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants' lives.Now, that's all well and good. Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would've made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn't the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that's it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don't worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what's his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn't even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he's only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder ""How bad are things in South Korea right now?"" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn't actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren't bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I'm just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn't you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let's do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun's gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I'm getting tired at this point, so I'll just leave it at that.If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two."
196,Squid Game,"Players are you ready to Die for the price yes sir, what the hell is going on, this concept was so intriguing that i had to see this series and there and behold i saw it for my self can't say I am a fan though but it's that good."
197,Squid Game,"This show keeps you glued to your seat from start to finish. It's done very well from every point of view, just the police actor shoul have been less younger.I hope for a second season.9/10 Bravo."
198,Squid Game,"Is it just me or have American TV Series gone mind numbingly stale?Squid Game definitely has it's flaws, but it definitely offers something fresh with a different perspective. And once again as with alot of Korean productions there is no fear of treading into dark territories without a care in the world for 'Hollywood' endings or sentiments.Also unlike US productions, this story appears to have been limited to a single series."
199,Squid Game,Every aspect of Squid Game is done almost to perfection. The character development is perfect and draws you into the contestants lives. You end up genuinely caring about many of them.The show is vibrant and fresh with dark undertones leaving you feeling unsettled throughout.The ending seems slightly forced but not enough to diminish this exceptional piece of work.
200,Squid Game,"I've enjoying this series, although it's a couple of episodes too long, and definitely doesn't stand to the hype that toots it.I appreciated the slightly more realistic portrayal of characters than in most movies, with good people shown to do bad things when pushed for survival.I also liked the balance of likeable characters from both genders, and the element of humanity, flawed such as it is.The story is not new, but there are a few twists in the first 3-4 episodes that I found smart enough. Starting with episode 7, the series starts to drag, and the ending is disappointing.Some details are far from smart (not to say plain dumb), but those details are minor enough not to cause stumbling.Overall, it's worth watching."
201,Squid Game,Of course as soon as squid games blew up Korean shows started flooding Netflix remember when crockadile Dundee blew up in america back in the 80 and 90's ya its like that.It will quickly fade as no one wants to do subtitles and bad translation and voice sync.There will be an audience in teh US but mostly like Anime it wont get mainstream again squid games was a fluke and it wasn't that good.
202,Squid Game,"I had to insist until engaging on to watch this one. In the beginning the cartoonish humor let me down very much. After overcoming that, it really gets interesting. Episodes leave you wanting to know what happens next. I felt very annoyed with all the main female characters but it was clearly the director's intention. Despite hating any type of reality TV it is a good entertainer anyway."
203,Squid Game,"Let me keep it straight.Squid Game has a better cinematography (see the color contrast!!!) but Alice in the Borderland is way darker (n thus better, personally) as a thriller and horror series. I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes. Which is to say, If u can't stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it's not something original and groundbreaking. As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane. The baddies are not that bad (at all!!). Finally, why there is always a super clean-n-tidy, pale skin, ""handsome"", smart, literate, elite entrepreneur young prince???? Where is the alpha-male?????!!!!!!"
204,Squid Game,"This drama has it all. The series highlights social issues while following a big group of desperate people trying to pay off their debts in a deadly game that entails children games turn bloody, lured in by a promise of big money.The simple question is how far would people go for a lot of money when they can't pay their debts. The secondary question barely touched is who would get a kick out of the killing."
205,Squid Game,"I was blown away when I first started watching this, but as the series went on it got a bit tedious, and some of the acting was terrible, especially from the woman who had the lighter, she almost made me want to abandon the whole series.There is some good acting though, and the idea of the series is very good and interesting.I'd like this to be re-made by the Americans, I think it would definitely be interesting."
206,Squid Game,"This show has some serious hype at the moment so I thought why not give it a go. This series is such an interesting concept, it's like a blend of hunger games and saw with some real life elements thrown in as well as some interesting Asian quirks. The way the show is set up just keeps you asking questions, the whole show is just a lot of questions really and it's great as it keeps your mind racing. Once I'd started this series I couldn't stop as I just needed to know what was happening next! This show just keeps you hooked and I love it. It's pretty emotional at times also, I didn't think I'd be so emotionally attached to these characters but by the end I was so engrossed and found myself really sad as certain characters were eliminated from the games. Honestly believe the hype that this show has and give it a watch!"
207,Squid Game,"Yes I might be exaggerating as it's quite different, but in a way this show reminds me ""Number six"" who desperately tried to escape that island.I miss The Prisoner's show, thus Squid Game fills it very well and even beyond."
208,Squid Game,There was quite a buzz around Squid Game over the last few weeks. There was positive as well as negative buzz regarding the violence.After watching through the show in the last 3 days I can say that the show is interesting in some aspects but has issues in others.The acting ranges from good to outrageously bad for some of the characters. The sound and visuals are pretty solid.When it comes down to the writing it's a bit of a rollercoaster as there are good and bad things there as well. I didn't really like the characters and some of the games presented were poorly thought out in terms of the rules and the characters didn't notice these issues which then made them act stupid.The ending of season 1 is rather open and like with many shows leaves room for a season 2. The question is whether or not they can make season 2 also interesting because I think we have seen the best twists the show has to offer in the first season.Also looking at the shows as a whole I can get behind the message it tries to deliver even with the problems.
209,Squid Game,"Just completed the series and found this show so thought provoking for many reasons. You have your standard character developmental checklist which is desperation, greed, boredom, curiosity, evilness and pure disregard that builds a cast of characters. The premise of the show is simple on the surface, but it much more complex the deeper you get into it.This show also brings a disturbing realization to me in real life:
I mentioned the show to my daughter who is in her first year of teaching kindergarten. She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents. What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents. The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going. It's not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality. 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother's throat to get out of. What a warm and fuzzy thought!"
210,Squid Game,"The first episode is so packed and dense with brilliance that even though it's only a hour long it felt like a full complete movie in and of itself, yet I was unable to look away the entire time it was that good."
211,Squid Game,"I am an ardent follower of the Korean movies. Even though most of the movies are laden with violence, gore and bloodbath, the chills and thrills of most of the movies I have watched till date have not disappointed me. But I was a bit apprehensive of watching a Korean web-series even though it is insanely popular and one of the most trending shows in the recent past. The very name Squid Game , the latest offering from Netflix did not appear to be very much appealing. However, I risked my time on the rave reviews the show is getting. And boy! It has paid back. I cannot recall any single show more edge of the seat than this. Yes, there may be better shows in terms of intrinsic production values. But if you ask me to select one show where even for one second, I could not hold my breath, it was this, it was this, nothing but this. Normally my hectic work schedule does not allow me to binge-watch a show. But Squid Game eventually turned me to a Binge-watcher. It is so much enjoyable, spine chilling and mind bending.It is believed that even if ghosts exist, the human beings are capable of making this world even a more ghostly place than the original ghosts would do. Basically, greed, lust, lack of control, survival instinct, desire for power and authority, insanity make people do macabre things and when people get the taste of blood, they become even more dangerous than the man-eating animals. Squid Game captivates human emotions to an extent you are awestruck. The level where people can stoop to, to make things shinier for his own life will make you sick as you watch episodes after episodes of this brilliantly made series. The raw violence and gore trademarks of the Korean style of moviemaking is present throughout and this makes the show unsuitable for the children even though the central theme is based on the games played during childhood. In the age of Super Computers, when people have stopped playing those forgotten games any longer, a group of losers are seduced to play six rounds of those games. Winning will guarantee them freedom from every debt as the rewards of winning are astronomical. But the punishment for losing is what makes the series so very horrific, gruesome and rewarding- death. How the real-life losers vie with each other to redeem their own lost hopes is the plot of this super paced series.The show is full of metaphors. It may be worth mentioning that of late numerous movies have also come up with the portrayal of the absence of an egalitarian society in South Korea. The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. Remember Parasite and the subtle show of class struggle therein? Squid Game also tends to point fingers to the inequality prevailing in the South Korean society. Few references to the illegal immigration from North Korea are there, too.Squid Game in may ways is similar to one movie I watched long back- Exam. There also the creator worked on the same concept and I liked that movie. But in Squid Game, the dividends are more rewarding, scintillating and thrilling. I simply cannot recall a single dull moment in the entire show with a runtime of around eight and half hours. The lead actors especially Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae Soo, Jung Ho-yeon are stunning. The old man (I could not google his name) was fascinating. The script is tight, gripping and addictive. The cinematography is insanely horrific just what the screenplay demanded. The music matches with the spirit of the show. The creator Hwang Dong-hyuk creates an environment that is claustrophobic, ominous and jaw dropping.Overall, this show will haunt you days after you have finished watching it. Remember, it is not an easy watch because of the abundance blood spill. But if you are a lover of the thriller/horror genre, this is a series you have been waiting for years. This is going to make amends for the poor choices Netflix has been making for sometime now. Be a player, watch Squid Game.My Rating - 9.5 out of 10."
212,Squid Game,"Battle Royal meets Belko Experiment with some SAW vibe twist at the end, that's all I'm saying if you have seen those 3 films this is the show combined. I have nothing negative to say this show was so well done and hope to see a second season soon!"
213,Squid Game,One of the best shows I have seen in quite some time 10/10 please give us more!! This show is so compelling and emotional and non-stop thrilling suspense!
214,Squid Game,"First of all I really thanks to the makers who have build this series. The writers, directors and the actors for their phenomenal performances. The way show starts from its first episode it will just hold your mind and body and let you stay still. Production design and vfx work are outstanding.Performance of all the cast are looking so real and the horror sequences that happens in the show that will just blow your mind. Don't wanna give much details just go and watch. You shouldn't miss the show if you are a series lover. NETFLIX has done it again. Just WOW....."
215,Squid Game,"Squid Game is an interesting and rather gruesome show about a group of financially troubled Korean adults who agree to play a sequestered group a children's games in order to compete for a large cash prize. Little do they know that there is a substantial price for losing, and they soon find themsevles in a sort of Korean style Hunger Games. The main characters engage in a protracted struggle for survival--once the players agree to play, they are not allowed to leave unless a majority of the players agree to end the game. Spurred on by greed (the prize is over 20 million US dollars) most agree to play on to the finish.This series is quite entertaining, but thematically owes much to other recent last-person-standing movies like Battle Royale and Hunger Games. This show is interesting because the characters are trapped not so much by their social class as in the Hunger Games, but rather by their bad decisions that result in their financial desperation. In that sense, the show seems to hold up a mirror to what society tends to do to people--set them in competition with each other and then severely punish the losers. The games are conceptually very ingenious and produce both suspense and interesting moral dilemmas. There's also a number of interesting subplots that I won't give away as spoilers.Squid Game is a pretty entertaining and addictive watch, but beware, it is really violent. There is plenty of suspense and some good characters, so much to enjoy if you are into this genre."
216,Squid Game,"Among other things, the writer/director stresses several times how the players are 'equal' and must be treated fairly. Then near the end, when the 3 finalists cross the glass bridge successfully, he has the bridge panels explode with great ferocity and causes the young woman to be seriously wounded (and later has her killer explain that it was a mercy killing... that she was terminally wounded. That's hardly fair, don't you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial. You mean all the world's class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?"
217,Squid Game,"Good main character, interesting sets and the promise of an interesting series. As the series went on, it got more samey and ludicrous. After each episode I was thinking, this is getting worse and worse. The ending certainly confirmed this and the final episode was the worst of the lot."
218,Squid Game,"Cube, Escape Room, The Cabin in the Woods, The Hunger Games....etc! Seems that mortal combats for the pleasure of elites has become very popular lately.Well, to be honest, it could have been so much better if it was made in America. A great plot though, some great lines(as well as cheesy ones) and twists but still lacks something in between. Sometimes it falls so deeply into its childish play you may wonder if the show has been made for juniors.Final thought: a very entertaining miniseries that I wished was made in Hollywood! End of story!"
219,Squid Game,"The first five episodes are thoroughly entertaining, fast-paced, and establish each character in a sufficiently believable-if a bit hollow-way.From episode 6 onward, the characters become real human beings and the emotion hits HARD. The stakes become real and gripping. I loved it.There are several holes in the story that are never explained, but with this being a continuing series, there will be opportunity for them to fix that.This is far deeper than I was expecting."
220,Squid Game,"Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.What other, also terrible films (""would you rather"" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of ""red light, green light"" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they're playing children's games, and why it's all happening, might offer some comfort, but it's all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the ""equality"" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it's so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they're badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content."
221,Squid Game,"I just started this series. I'll finish because the story is excellent. Good characters, good drama, thought provoking...all the makings of a stellar viewing experience.But in my whole life....the English dubbing on this is THE WORST and it totally takes away from the excellence of the overall story. I only speak English, and I'm finding myself taking mental notes of the million different better ways this could have been translated to make it more compelling. Seriously, the English in this series is like porn dialogue. Who at Netflix thought this translation mess was ok? Do better Netflix."
222,Squid Game,"Finally after so much hypes and promotions over Social media platforms I have binge watched this Squid Games season 1 during this weekend. First of all this movie shows us the perfect examples of Human behaviors that too in a very practical way. The character development of this show is top notch and the set design/locations was tremendously great. The screenplay was good but I think it was dragged a bit to showcase the Game scenes and players emotions during gameplay which was good actually.Actually we have already watched this kind of concepts earlier so nothing new in it except those +ve points mentioned in above paragraph. It's wholesome bloodsheds allover this show so it's better if you're 16+ then you can go for it. It have also a little sexual intercourse scene was there for around 40-45Sec so better to avoid watching with senior family members ; of course you can go with your brothers/sisters if they're comfortable with these little scenes.And Finally I will rate it 6 out of 10 Stars from my side, because for me it's just a One Time Watch kind of season. You can go for it... It's worth spending time if you wanna enjoy a show during your leisure time."
223,Squid Game,"It wasn't until episode of the VIPs that I changed to have its original language and subtitles. This totally changed my view of the entire series and I may have to go back and rewatch it particularly because of the poor dubbing in English which the text wasn't bad, it was the inflection and tone that was obnoxious.The last episode is profound and leaves an open for a second series. There is still confusion in my mind over the detective/brother plot line."
224,Squid Game,"Just a thrilling series. The camera work,sets just beautiful,amazing acting. It keeps you wanting more. At the end we all where VIPS to the Squid Games."
225,Squid Game,"Even after that atrocious second episode I'd recovered some interest and intrigue in the various plot-lines. I rated it a steady 7/10 and then the penultimate episode dropped me to a 6/10 then the last episode was awful: dead mum, red hair, pointless and unsatisfying twist with the old man. I mean, come on! If he wanted some people to play these old games with why not organise a tournament where no-one dies and everyone has a fun, happy time competing for the money? And the red hair - wtf? And the money - the old dear who has this adopted son foisted on her is going to agonise over spending those billions because she thinks it's for Cho Sang-woo.I'm just gutted that the series played out the way it did becuase up to that point it was OK. Really though it never lived up to the tension of the set-up and the consequences of the first game.My conclusion to all this - Netflix have a brilliant marketing departmnet and they know how to dial the right dials even when the product isn't that great, or original."
226,Squid Game,"The was a fun, fascinating show that was more emotional than I ever expected it to be but also not as violent as I was expecting either. There is some brutal violence but extremely tolerable unless you are squeamish.Many of the characters you will feel a connection to even if they aren't in the main cast. There are some you will enjoy getting their ""come up'ins"" to a satisfying end. The choices the lead characters make will enrage you and make you despise them but the backstory given to those characters will also make you understand why they do/did the things they do/did.There isn't much in the way of surprises (except the hair, if you've finished you know what I mean) but there are some decent plot twists that may catch you off guard. The 6 games themselves, many across the world will know or may have even done; some you'll be like ""really?"". All are brutal by design. This is worth the watch and dubbing in English didn't look or sound as bad as it could have."
227,Squid Game,"The best part about this show are the characters, gi-hun is a great main focus, say-byeok is a great secondary protagonist, sang-woo is a great twist villian after deok-su dies a few episodes short of the finale, and speaking of the final episode, that was my only problem with the show, the final episode is actually really confusing and the twist reveal at the end felt really forced, overall, this show is great, but the conclusion was disappointing, I'll be sure to review season 2 when it comes out."
228,Squid Game,"I was really enjoying this series until the last episode... it completely threw out the awesome character arc of the protagonist to set it up for a second season when it was obviously supposed to end of a semi-downer ending... which would have been effective and great.This film isn't that original. It really bugs me that American audiences find this to be so ""unique"". This concept has been used in many plots... for a long time... Especially in Asian cinema. So everyone should just relax.Still, this is a pretty great series. I just feel sorry for anyone that has to watch the last episode..."
229,Squid Game,Dont listen to twitter on this show its not over the top it has no deep message. Its just fine.
230,Squid Game,"Good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated."
231,Squid Game,Wow this show had me on an emotional roller coaster. It really makes you wonder could you really be that cold if you were in the same predicament. I became invested in the main characters background stories and rooted for them throughout the entire competition. The most heartbreaking scene was when Ali died he was very kind-hearted and the game was too cut throat. I can't believe the old man was the chairman behind this operation.
232,Squid Game,"The acting is absolutely atrocious throughout with the possible exception of the female lead who's a South Korean model turned actress and one or two others. The main female antagonist is one of the worst actors I've ever seen...ever, she overacts to the point that I was waiting for her head to explode and I cheered when she finally bought it so I wouldn't be subjected to any more of her ""acting"". And even allowing for the dubbing the dialogue is often worse than the acting, corny, cheesy, very dated. And I found the main character to be too much of a loser, to the point that while I knew I was supposed to, I felt no sympathy for him at all. Because all of his problems were completely self-inflicted and he continued to be a loser through the entire series...I just didn't care about him.There are plot holes wide enough to drive a truck through. Like the police detective who manages to infiltrate the island and fool everyone even though there's security everywhere and the guards are computer coded. And lets not even mention how he was able to follow the van from about 30 yards back and then move around on the ferry without anyone seeing him....and I guess I missed the reasoning behind the Front Man being his brother and killing him....And yet.... I couldn't stop watching it....because the writing is incredible, especially compared to the absolute drek coming out of Hollywood these days. And while the acting leaves something to be desired the characters are refreshingly realistic in the way they react to what's happening around them. There are no heroics, no women who can kick the ass of a guy twice their size, no men who end up figuring a way out of the mess they're in. There are just real people dealing with a horrific situation the way actual real live people would, not the way what passes for real people in Hollywood do. The emotions are raw, the situations are brutal and the good guys don't always win because at the end of the day there aren't any good guys...just people trying to survive but not giving a thought to what it's costing them to do it. Episode six was the absolute high point of the series, it felt like a gut punch while I was watching it, how often can you say that about a mainstream series or movie these days? That episode was some of the best drama, some of the best writing I've seen in many years and I think it will stay with me for some time.Sorry to say that they couldn't really maintain it after that. The resolution of the cops story line was lame and I'm not even sure why he was there at all. I'm sure there's something I missed about why his brother, the Front Man, killed him but.... I missed it. The rich spectators were lame; basically tired cliché's.And the end just kind of fizzled. I know a lot of people think the main character evolved during the games and came out a different person but I have to disagree. He was a loser at the beginning and still one at the end. The old man had a very good point in the final episode, every player was there by choice, they all left and, already knowing what it entailed, made the decision to return. Yet the main character seems to want to blame everyone else for his trauma, the old man, the people running the game, everyone except himself because nothing is ever his fault. He hasn't changed, he makes a half-assed attempt to do right by his promise to the female player by getting her brother and dropping him off with his friends mother but he apparently abandon's the girls mother in the north and in the end fails his own daughter...yet again because he'd rather wallow in guilt and his own self-inflicted misery that try to move on. He's still a loser....just a rich one.Squid Game is yet another version of a very old and well worn story, the difference is that it made the characters into real people who dealt with what was happening around them the way real people would. That's what makes it better than other versions of the same story. And it makes it light years better than any of the drek being churned out by Hollywood these days. Even with it's flaws I highly recommend it. Just be prepared to be emotionally beaten up by it!"
233,Squid Game,"This is a simple formula that has been done to death ""poor people being made to do highly fatal games while rich people watch"". By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like ""it's an study of human nature"" etc etc. The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes. This world and it's environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games. I enjoyed it well enough but let's face it, this is no 8.0+ IMDB ratings are a joke."
234,Squid Game,"The problem with a mini series that starts out as good as this one is, it's really hard to keep the same intensity for eight more episodes. The first episode is arguably the most intense and shocking 55 minutes ever filmed. So there's bound to be a drop off. Even so, the entire series is extremely watchable and even binge worthy. If you're looking for something different... THIS IS IT !!"
235,Squid Game,"A breath taking series
A game of wealthy and pain through pleasure beasts in human form, against desperate people for money...
Betting their precious lifes just for one to take the price and get out alive
Would you play?Watch it now!!!"
236,Squid Game,"Content: ok. The creativity in the horror genre, depicting the dark side of society, human decadence.Visual effects: nothing
Music: nothing.Emotions. Feeling scared by the killing scenes. Fear Level: 3/5. As the episodes go on, the fear decreases
Feeling angry in episode 8.Feeling sad and emotional in episode 6.Feeling quite nervous before the games starts.Average score of episodes: 6+7+7+4+5+7+4+8+6/9ep=6.Good and positive messages and emotions: almost none.Should this season be re-watched?: No."
237,Squid Game,"I started watching this series having heard that it is one of the most successful Netflix series ever produced. It was definitely a great series. The treatment, social message etc were great. Kinda reminded me of a movie I watched called Platform. But i would stop short of calling it the best. The concept might have been given a bit different treatment but at the end it was still akin to an escape room. The scenario under which the participants come back also sounds far fetched. Ok there could be a lot of difficulties and hardships in the outside world but would someone want to go back to a place risking their lives where they are 99% sure to die. But the show depicts that the people once left the show first time they were so desperate for money that they came back irrespective of the dangers there. Not so believable according to me. The reasoning of the old man why he conducted this game was also kind of ridiculous. But all fine in the name of fiction. Loved the characters otherwise."
238,Squid Game,The show is just okay. I don't get all of the hype. There are a lot of plot holes and the story doesn't make much sense. There are too many slow motion shots. I think it's because there isn't much of a story. None of the characters are likeable. You never really care about who lives or dies.
239,Squid Game,Attractive games I remember the chess game on Harry potter movies.I hate the cheater who killed Ali. And the policeman is really annoying hope see him dead.
240,Squid Game,"I have been very greatly entertained by this series. I would have given it a 10 but I took a point off because of the poor acting from the VIP's and the ending that seemed rushed. I could have thought of a better suited and deserving ending instead of a destructive one. I also did not understand the drastic change of hair color in the end. The subtitles can also be improved. Accurate translations including the slangs can change the effect of any foreign film.All in all, this series is fantastic! It has interesting twists and surprises. It is violent so I definitely do not recommend for kids to watch even though it has kids games in it. The story reminded me of The Hunger Games but also unique in its own way. I would classify this as Horror/Drama/Thriller genre. The character development is very well written where a lot of movies fail to succeed. It is very important to any movie. Episode 7 for me is quite emotional and also 9. You have to be cold hearted not to fight back the emotions of what this episode brings. All the main characters did a great job. I like the mixture of different types of people. Definitely recommend."
241,Squid Game,"First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes ""Kamisama no iu tôri."" It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i've always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. It's hard to connect with the story and the actors when they're expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from ""actors"" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.Finally: Squid Game could've been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else. This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. The games wasn't fun (and we've seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring."
242,Squid Game,"Very well done production. It was like a modern day Twilight Zone. Character development was excellent, music/score was spot on and like another important character, and story was well done. It was creepy, chilling, bloody, touching, and emotional. It had a little bit of everything.The very few complaints about it I do have don't outweigh the good points - The acting was a little over-done at times. The voices and lines of the VIPs were way over-acted, the subtitles were very fast and hard to keep up with at times, and the last episode/ ending was just a little too bizarre - it took away from the good parts of the earlier episodes.But definitely watch it."
243,Squid Game,"68/100I finally decided to finishe this show after being on my list for months. I don't have much to say other than to highlight the inconsistency of the script of its episodes, which became extremely annoying after a few chapters.For instance, episode 6 is easily the best episode of the entire series. Right after, you are introduced to one of the worst; it's almost as if you have to reward those moments when Squid Game truly shows its innovation. That's why the ending, although disappointing, I can't be surprised at the fact that it was executed in such a way.Speaking of whether or not this series is truly innovative, it definitely has its own quirky streak, one that the series isn't afraid to exploit almost 100%. Many times these moments may not work for me taking into account the contrasting contextualization that the program possesses but, one way or another, it's still appreciated.Impressive performances by the cast but that can be affected once certain new characters enter.The only thing that really remained throughout the program was its technical aspects. It got to a point where I was blown away by some of the editing decisions the series would make. They would seem simple, but they are refreshing to see for a series with so many ""action"" scenes.Squid Game fully understood how to stand out, which is why it will become one of the most remembered shows in the coming years. However, popularity never meant quality, and this might be the best example of that saying yet."
244,Squid Game,"I bought into the hype and watched this mess. I am very confused about what people see in it. I can look past the horrible over acting by the VO artists, stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development. I stuck it out until the end and was completely let down. By far, the worst finale of any series in history."
245,Squid Game,"It was good - but no where near as good as all the hype and talk led you to believe. The basic concept - we've all seen it before - but still nonetheless it was okay - I enjoyed watching it, it's a bit over the top and actually fairly predictable - but it was good, but no where near as good as so many people are making it out to be!"
246,Squid Game,"I hate violence in movies but somehow could not stop watching this. The story is intriguing - a group of down-in-their-luck men and women were invited to play a series of kids' games that pitted their lives against each other for a prize of billions of wons. I couldn't help wondering whether millions of viewers all over the world also have the same question: if you are up to your neck in debt, would you join the game?I guess the reason I kept watching this despite my aversion to violence is because the violence is necessary to show viewers the horrendousness of greed. It shows how evil love of money is, that one would be willing to die for it. This begs another question: how is this game different from the game millions of people play everyday, sacrificing their relationships, health, principles, dignity and self-respect for jobs and other sources of income?"
247,Squid Game,"SG is a foray into the callused debauchery of which humans are capable. It builds on 'The Most Dangerous Game' w/ a twist. Here, bored positive-balance-sheeted rustlers devise a game, that enables them to entice poor souls in financial straits, to come out & play. The key is in what the players weren't told, not what they were: 456 competitors may enter, but only one will exit alive at the end. These Tattersalls denizens don't compete, except to bet on the ""horses"" performances... & deaths.SG asks its viewers if they believe humans are good. Not quite, right? I was yelling at the screen like I was back at, well, the races. It isn't a matter of players acting horror-movie-lame, rather, it's their failure to timely process how, at a frenzied Gallop, the race was degrading into barbarism. Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!! Work on the word ""NO!"" Augh! Pleading w/ them has no effect. All viewers can do is watch in dismay.The violence is lurid, but not gratuitous. Author, Hwang Dong-hyuk, stated his purpose: ""I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life."" He was poaching from the gauntlet of his own fiscal hardships.Kdramas excel at juicing the viewer to extract every wince & gasp. The paddock lined w/ dewy pink, Easter green & childlike trappings is a visceral mocking horror; a real dread multiplier.The players aren't the only losers. The police Ofr's story is grim. Hwang Jin-ho went there to save his brother. Seduced by the power of the dark side, the frontman won't let *anybody* move in on *him*. So he brought his own brother down. That's pain. Frontman actor, Lee Byung-hun, aced an expression of curtailed grief, tinged with guilt, + overt resolve to cantor forward. After all, it was his brother or him.1 - 456, when Kdrama screen writers assign #s to players, they likely have a correlation to their values in Numerology. It's about adding layers of depth & meaning to the script, & not for pushing a belief system. We can easily decode what the writer is announcing b/c varied Numerology websites are fairly consistent. While the definitions, as in astrology, tend to be generalized so as to broaden the application, let's jump in to see if any of the player's #s are messages to viewers.>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & #456 signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach a #456 how work harder on oneself and add value to life. 456 picked up 001 as a gganbu trainer, evincing that, plainly, moral fortitude is no prerequisite.>218 is Cho Sang-woo, 456's 'friend' who worked up from the 'hood,' to being a whilte-collar hood. To a point, he mirrors 001. This loathsome in-runner surprisingly gave up the fight, but not before becoming a murderer. #218 is for manifesting one's biggest & on the face, near impossible desires (💰) into reality. Business, duality, & serving humanity must coexist. 218 knows that 456 will serve his mother AND humanity w/ the 💰. 218 failed in his run to win that💰, but he found redemption in his last moments.>067 is Kang Sae-byeok, from NK, who strives to protect her family. No surprise: #067 signifies home, family, unconditional love, responsibility, sacrifice & service. Creating a solid foundation for the future, & protection of family & possessions is a #067's priority.>001, the old man, is most positive when pacing for work. #001 is, recognition for 1st place; it represents independence, but can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>101 is gangster, Jang Deok-su. A #101's primary function is romance, w/ importance of relationships right behind. At first blush this doesn't fit w/ the character, though he did get involved in a quasi romantic trist. Let's flesh it out further.A #101 needs coexistence. Without it, a #101 is alone. People w/ that # can feel lonely & lost just thinking of being alone. 101 obviously grew up w/o basic needs & training, leaving him consumed w/ bitterness & ill-prepared for rigid competition. #101 also points to eternity & the journey that is about to begin w/all its uncertainties. It's a reminder that we are not in control of our destiny, God is, so #101s should follow the course & learn before their time on this plane is over. It's sad to think that 101 didn't get emotional support or the care needed for success. He is still responsible for his infractions, but it's sad, none the less. He parallels the VIP who was attracted to the cop. They both had the same expression of shock, disbelief, & the beginnings of acceptance, when facing death.>199 is Abdul Ali, one of the worst upsets of the show. #199s are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda. For Ali it's providing for his family - independently. A #199's goals virtually never conflict w/ humanity's survival & long-term well-being. We see that Ali is good, albeit naive, & foolish to be so independent that he'd wager his life on a long shot to try & provide for his family.>212 is Han Mi-nyeo, the 'crazy Mare' who brought down 101. #212s frequently chase curiosity & adventure, and ALL new, shiny objects, often on a whim. #212s can be good team member & their energy can be sensual. Jumping the fence may lead to negative outcomes. Enroute towards goals, they can face harsh obstacles. An add'l similarity to 101 is that only the negative interpretations are exhibited by them. Their harsh lives had severed them from the positive elements w/in themselves. They portray ruthlessness, but there is a forlornless about them, too.>111 is the doctor. A #111 won't let himself be slotted into a team member role, unless the role is real leadership. They haven't been broken. If #111's thoughts are negative, it could attract toxic situations & people.>240 is just released from prison for putting down her abusive 'sire', 'Philly' Ji-yeong. #240 is about nurture & mutual support w/ a high focus on security & the future, all provided without expectation of return. She went underfoot for 067, & thus negated the lie the VIP's tell themselves about human nature. Having already sacrificed her freedom to deliver justice to her mother, 067 is the moral center of the show.>244, the pastor: Spiritual advancement can be phenomenal in a #244's life. He must keep wrong at bay & not offend the inner energy installed by his maker.>The husband/wife duo is portrayed in #69, or two identical digits facing & complimenting each other to make a whole. If we squeeze 6&9 together we can make an 8, which, toppled, is the eternity sign. In addition, the visual aspect of the # is related to ying&yang. The energy of #69 is best when involved directly w/family or team as an equal. Freakily, #069 symbolizes the closure of a chapter in life & encourages one to be prepared for traumatic phase. Whether ending good or bad, it is bound to bring a huge change. Be prepared for it, b/c the the manner in which it's dealt with will effect one's future.Finally, upon the runners' return, in EP3, 187 players re-enter the stalls: The US police code for murder.Getting chills?Oh, these ""poor,"" rich, hacked-up GOONS. Their lives are so empteee. Sigh. Studies show around 21% off CEO's are psychopaths. It's not a stretch to guess that some of these fulsome degenerates are in that club, given their heightened sadism. These reprobates can't seem to notice through all the haze of pride, that people are most gratified when we help others.001 didn't get what he wanted by hosting SG, which was a panecea for loneliness & boredom. It seems he & the VIPs justify their actions by deluding themselves that they are conducting a social experiment - Reassuring themselves that everyone is as cutthroat as they, leads to pitting people against each other. This enables them to inveigle their own selves that those people deserve to die: 'Just look at who they really are! It's voluntary... Anyway, they all get a fair chance.'In the end, the old man had the whole world, but was utterly unsatisfied. Craving the comraderie he'd had while growing up poor, he felt that kinship w/ 456, even though 456 eventually betrayed him. At the time, 456 even had a second chance. He could have done the all-or-nothing, but refused. That plot point of betrayal, while needed, was his worst moment. The old man was playing him all day to tempt him, but he meant it when he called 456 his gganbu, or close buddy.The kinship manifests itself when the old man wants to see HIM at the end of his life. 456 is there, bedside, when #1 dies. Where's his wife? Where's his kids?? Where's his grandkids??? Can I get a mistress? Nope. Just 456 & an aid were there. Next, 001 saves 456's 'life' a second time, by jerking 456's bit toward living, rather than merely existing.456 is who he is. He wins 3x's in the show's run, but even when he wins, he's a pathetic loser that barely stumbles over the line. In winning, his soul was put-down. When he went to see the old man in the penthouse, he won their game, but he again, didn't get what he wanted, as 001 died before 456 could kill him. It did wake 456 up. He no longer has to feel guilty about flashing a laser in the old man's eyes during the race: His regret is not shipping 001 off to the dog food plant himself.The red hair broadcasts that he's now either on fire, or starting to blaze his trail. Finally. This is not over. We need a season 2. The question has not been answered yet. #456 is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. Here's my ante-post bet & hope: In S2, he'll be stallion #789 who tramples out the ghoulish fraternity of gamers.Quote:

For age 15+"
248,Squid Game,"SG is another foray into the callus debauchery of which humans are capable. If there's no umpire, they will always run offsides. It is a display of the mutual annihilation pact we enter when it's ""every man for himself.""This eventing builds on 'The Most Dangerous Game' with a twist. Here, bored, specialized multipliers of their own net worth, devise a game in which they entice impoverished souls who are in a asset-liability crisis to come out & play. We all know that money isn't everything, but it sure fills in divets so the race of life will run smoothly.Instead of the fulsome, rebrobate 1%ers participating in the contest, they prefer to spectate from the comfort of their big screens, or private luxury box, while the ""horses"" perform... & die.Do YOU believe humans are good? Not quite, right?SG had me yelling at the screen like I was back at, well, the races. It not necessarily that all the players are horror-movie-stupid, but rather, many didn't disern quickly enough how the ""game"" was metamorphosing into ruthless savagery. I tried to plead with them: Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!!! Work on the word ""NO!"" Augh! The players do soon understand that the only rules that apply are the ones that they are explicitly given by the referees. The penalties for running out of the basepaths are, Umm... Severe.The first two episodes focus on the wild swings 456 experiences when his journey begins. We watch 456 enter a limo, awake to a surreal psychotropic trip in the lofty dorm of horse stalls (300ft high, maybe?) & finally exit into the calamitous onslaught of Game 1.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the author stated his purpose: ""I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life."" He was building on his own experience of financial irons that kept his account in the red. The script is a metaphor for his own monetary gauntlet.For those of you who are new to Korean programming: Hey! We've been waiting for you;) Just relax, you should achieve your subtitle fitness almost immediately. The whole world is watching our entertainment deposits that way. If you can't diversify, they win!K-dramas excel at withdrawing every possible wince & gasp out of the viewer. In general, the writing, directing, acting, & overall play are consistently supplying returns on investment due to the high quality of execution. So much so, that they're in danger of their stats being overlooked. Korea's got talent.SG is more of the same. It is superb dressage, or pagentry. This particularly applies to the horror genre, which is loaded with dumbed down characters& dialogue, lots more blood& guts, & an extraordinarily evil feel to the substandard works. A de-worming & thorough muck-out is in order. SG blows the whistle on those foul circulations. The violence is jolting, but not gratuitous or meaningless. There is a message for us.Yet, K-Dramas, like Simone Biles, can twist professionally, with beautiful strength. K-Dramas spiral the knife into the viewer's psyche with disciplined follow-through. The absolute demented sickness of using the innocent color pink, with other pseudo-cheerful colors, (that also resemble many medicines, such as Pepto Bismal) plus the kiddie trappings (such as the giant doll) is all nauseating. It a dread multiplier.K-dramas also tend to drop players on the audience that are the most extremes of themselves in the beginning of the shoot. A multi-episode show allows ample time to invest in talent to improve performance & yield gains. Just remember that most of the people you see on the screen will either dramatically transform, or the audience's appreciation of them will change, as the series matures. You may squander your currency backing a failing commodity, while another's performance might lead your fantasy team to victory. 456 is pathetically & painfully a substandard performer of the worst sort: over 40, living with mom, swiping her money to go gambling on horses... Has he ever been bullish? Not likely. He's thoroughly contemptible, & relegated to the penny stocks. I was aggravated at the thought of up to 9 innings/episodes monitoring his performance. It was doubtful he would gain any interest.Every competing ""horse"" has a number. If Korean screen writers assign numbers to jerseys, or saddlepads, it's likely said numbers have a commodity backing their values in Numerology- This is not meant to be an endorsement, it is to forensically decode what the writer is announcing in the stadium. Definitions in Numerology, like astrology, tend to be generalized. This broadens the applications, & provides a utitly player that can rebound into several positions. Having said that, Let's see if any of the numbers the author assigned have any credit values...>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach how to learn to work harder on oneself before other things. Hard work will add value to life.Check. It's applicable.>218 is for Cho Sang-woo, 456's friend from the 'hood.' The number 218 symbolizes manifesting one's biggest & seemingly impossible desires into reality, often related to wealth.>001, the old man's # is at its most positive when in the realm of work. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. This number represents independence, but this can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>199 is Abdul Ali. 199's are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda, which, for Ali, is providing for his family on his own. #199's goals virtually never conflict with long-term human survival & well-being.Check, check, check, again. And on it goes.Getting chills? If not, you probably haven't seen the show yet. Just wait until you do. The strategy trotted out is medal-winning. Just be woke about what the show is about. It is not about displaying incidental, cheap, & meaningless horror for the purposes of titillation. SG is a metaphor for the writer's own hardships in a cruel, uber competitive & heartless society. The players all represent the downtrodden, like geldings in irons.Most of their backstories, if broadcasted on GoFundMe, would get scouted for assistance. I'd be tempted to contribute to several of them. Even the criminals are subtley shown to have been wedged into their life choices. Delving into one gangster's number (101) exposes his basic needs that clearly weren't met in his life. It played a role in his projected gains & losses.K-dramas are also wont to lob surprises, or deferred options the viewer didn't account for, into the works. Expect that not everything is what it seems to be. Avoid being roped in by Ponzi Schemes.This is not over. We need a season two. The question has not been answered yet. 456's number is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. To the extent that he accomplishes anything, true to form, he would barely get a neck over the line. Heres my ante-post bet & hope: In season 2, he'll be the stallion that tramples the game runners as a #789.Apologies for mixing monetary, equestrian, & sports metaphors over here. I'm not good with rules either.Quote:
Good rain knows when to fall. ~Du Fu~I also did a spoiler review.🎭8.5 🎬8.5 🤔8⚡8🎨7🔚9."
249,Squid Game,"I really liked the three first episodes, none of the following were bad but the three first were great. Some parts of this series is a great psycological exploration of friendship, sacrifice and human desperation. The ending was unexpected in some ways."
250,Squid Game,"One problem I am finding is with more asian made entertainment, now they get higher ratings by other asians simply because it's asian made. Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture.I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn't love it like some are. It's yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style. It's not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing. Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing.This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio. We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles. But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes. So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs.And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)..... it is AWFUL. Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices. I know some don't like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion."
251,Squid Game,"You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked...""Can money buy you happiness?"". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN's exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?There's just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly. The VIPs though are very bad in acting that is one negative. Overall, a must watch entertainer which can be binge watched in one go (or you may take two days considering it is a bit too long)."
252,Squid Game,"This show is a farce. The acting is Atrocious!!!!!! How is this drivel getting such high reviews???? It's terrible, its awful."
253,Squid Game,"10/10 great tv series, must watch unlike any other series you watched/"
254,Squid Game,"Kids may not know it is basically a copy of the Japanese movie ""As the Gods Will"" - the first chapters are identical concepta add then bits of ""Escape Room"" ""The Cube"" and the ultraviolence of ""A clockwork Orange"" (btw the VIP lounge scene is obviously idea taken from the Clockwork Orange movie's ""Milk Bar"" scene).Also the English subtitles are awful.The ending was so disappointing. And the last episode was half as long! Underwhelming."
255,Squid Game,"The show was decent, worth watching but not as great as some are saying. Took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing. Get ready for season 2."
256,Squid Game,"I put it on my watchlist because I absolutely love korean thrillers. I love the style and the type of writing the screenplay of almost every korean thriller and drama. Then I went to vacation and when I came back the hype about this series was incredible. I hope that more people love korean movies and series now as much as I do. Very nice, didn't disappointed and is as good as I expected when putting it on my watchlist."
257,Squid Game,"Must Must must watch it, I finished it in just one day, i was glued with my chair whole day to finish last episode get predictable But it don't ruin your enjoyment. I heard about it from one of my friend and watched it and won't regret."
258,Squid Game,"As a Korean series, it was good actually. Good acting from the Korean actors, but foreigners? NO, It was extremely bad as you feel that they are just reading what they have to say
Anyways, it takes eight for all."
259,Squid Game,"Let me preface: no, I am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can't wrap my head around the hype. Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc. So I'm thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it's new or innovating.Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there's only one winner.In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste. Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not. I didn't enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. I'd suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be."
260,Squid Game,"After a couple of episodes I thought I wouldn't last to the end of the series. But it became oddly compulsive, and by about half way you definitely want to know how it all ends.But it is not that great. There is a lot of repetitiveness in the story, and it is drawn out over rather too many episodes.Moderate acting, but the main character was good.If you are looking for something different, well worth a try - as long as you can tolerate extreme violence."
261,Squid Game,"After ""Liar Game"" and ""Alice in Borderland"" we have ""Squid game"".Some parts have been gruesome and to much fo me but thank God it's on Netflix and I could skip :).Marbles game was so emotional that I have cried a little and I'm not ashamed to admit it.Very happy to have binge watch it.PS. Gong Yoo from ""Train to Busan"" or Goblin has also a short appearance among many other known actors from K-dramas."
262,Squid Game,"Kind of the same thing as Alice in borderland except the motives, characters, and drama are done much better. I also like that most of the characters are adults with relatable issues. I'm tired of teen drama. Take note Netflix you got a winner here."
263,Squid Game,"Yes this can be seen as a dystopian fiction. Like Maze Runner, Hunger games, you name it. But the fact that they put children's games into the mix was a concept that was pulled off very well and in a way that made you feel a major amout of tension. I can only hope that this gets renewed for Season 2. If not then it had a hell of a run."
264,Squid Game,"You know, not that bad considering overhype. Ephemera, no more, but has a good picture, music and let's say not so banal development of events( of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer, but for most series and viewers), let's say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement (usually it is so). Strongest side of this series is an acting, it is really solid. I think, considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as 1."
265,Squid Game,"It started slower than I had anticipated, but I understand it's because they want the viewers to get to know one of the main characters a bit more. The games themselves are fun, yet sometimes sad to watch.....you will know what I mean when you get to the marbles game......no spoilers here! The show gets better as the episodes go on and I found myself rooting for a few of the participants. It's a fun show to watch, but the cruelty of humankind is just insane. The lengths people will go to survive is real and sad. I watched with subtitles because dubbing is always terrible and takes away from the characters in my opinion. Overall, I would recommend this show as it's very different from anything out there and after episode 3, keeps you in your seat."
266,Squid Game,"The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a ""battle royale"" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn't matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a ""good heart"" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don't matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are ""forced"" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, ""we can win this with everyone still alive"". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a ""final boss"" enemy in the show.I won't spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of "" saw that coming"" and ""give me a break"" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further."
267,Squid Game,"Squid Game has to be the most unique show I've ever seen in my life. Everything from the music, cinematography and genius storytelling lead it to be my favorite show of 2021 and in my new Top 10 fav shows of all time..."
268,Squid Game,"I think the first 4 episodes were really excitement but gradually at the end of this seire I think that was really boring and really predictable, especially the last episode in my opinion was really terrible!"
269,Squid Game,I think the first 4 episodes were really excitement but gradually at the end of the serie the movie was really boring and predictable! Especially the last episode was really terrible and I hoped that I shouldn't follow this seire!
270,Squid Game,"Started well. But mid way through, it gets tired and feels sluggish. The games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc. The ending was horrible and vague.It shows that losers will be losers even after winning. Just not relevant in today's world."
271,Squid Game,This is for immature kids. Its your classic Netflix show. I kept hearing people say its good so tried to give it a good go bit start of episode 3 i had to switch off as my brain cells were slowly dying LoL.
272,Squid Game,"Very similar to ""The Running Man"" (1987) in plot, although it plays more like ""Battle Royale"" (2000) and ""The Belko Experiment"" (2016).The whole story starts with a broken loser getting contacted by a guy that knows absolutely everything about him (in an almost supernatural way.) He invites him to play a game, which would reward a humongous amount of money to the winners (if there are more than one winner, the money is divided amongst them, inciting them to try to win alone.)When playing the first game, though, the players find out that losing means dying (or getting killed!) Obviously, people freak out and a lot of them die immediately. After that, people vote to go back home, without any prize.Episode 2 is dedicated to show the survivors that their lives are hell on earth, so many of them decide to go back into the game. That was at the same time the best episode of the whole series and the worst: a whole episode filled with fabricated drama, to built backgrounds for many characters, which prove to be absolutely meaningless later on, because the story simply ignores their psychological profiles and life baggage, making them act and react at the necessity of the plot.Key characters' personalities change ""sides"" just too many times along the series, at the will of the writer. For instance, the protagonist starts as a jerk, stealing money from his mother (for gambling, nonetheless,) then becomes a soft-hearted man, trying to connect with his daughter and save everybody, then becomes a jerk again, trying to save himself at the cost of others' lives, then soft again, then jerk, and so on. Especially in the last episode, his changes make absolutely no sense whatsoever.Before his last friend dies, she asks him to promise to go look for her brother, but he doesn't promise (in a ""I won't promise, because we are both getting out of here"" kind of moment, although not actually voiced that way.) When he's out, he enters jerk mode, effectively not going after her brother for a whole year.Anyway, his girl friend is killed by his ex-best-friend-forever, so, obviously, the protagonist is forced into jerk mode and tries to kill his ex-friend-turned-arch-enemy... Until he has an opportunity to win the game and let him die... Making him go back into soft mode... Then his ex-best-friend, for absolutely no imaginable reason, kills himself (in a ""if I don't die, we are both going to die, so I better kill myself, because you bozo won't let me die"" moment...) Game over! The protagonist wins, time to go home, in jerk mode, of course, for reasons.Then, another plot twist, shamelessly copied from ""Saw"" (2004): one of the protagonist's previously dead friends was not dead at all, he was the mastermind and game master! After a long and boring speech, which is basically a Korean translation of the final speech from ""Saw III"" (2006), the protagonist enters soft mode again and go after his dead girl friend's brother (something that makes absolutely no sense, as she had never said who or where he was, because she was very secretive about her past, having escaped from North Korea - even her name was kept secret!)BUT (yes, a huge ""but"" there) he was in false soft mode! After getting the boy out of the orphanage he was kept in, he ditches him (and a case full of money) with the old mother of a dead friend and disappears! After that, he enters actual soft mode and gets a ticket to fly to meet his daughter, whom he supposedly loved so much that he decided to risk his life getting back into the Squid Game (to be fair, he also did it to save his mother's life, whom he finds dead after he goes back home, but two wrongs don't make one right, right?)BUT (oh no, another plot twist!), on his way to the airport, he meets the guy that recruited him to play the Squid Game...! And does nothing about it! He continues on his way to the airport, because he loves his daughter, right? Apparently, wrong! As he's boarding the plane, he decides to pick the recruiter's card and call: he wants revenge for what they did to him, and he's mad, and he's back in full throttle jerk mode...! What, again, makes absolutely no sense! The mastermind is dead, so whoever is the game master has absolutely nothing to do with him! Besides, he voluntarily decided to enter the game, so, if any one's to be blamed for all that happened, it's himself!Except for one game (tug-of-war), all others are amazingly lame and people die for nothing, just to advance the plot toward the scripted lame ending.The random changes of heart of the characters made me want to finish watching the series just to get over with it and never look back. Aside from the protagonist's soft/jerk mode switching, what happened to his ex-best-friend-forever was probably the worst character development I have ever seen. In the beginning, we are made to believe he's a nice guy with a truck-load of bad luck. Then, when he's back into the game, he secretly tries to kill all of his friends, for absolutely no reason. To make it very clear that the first time was not a mistake or misunderstanding, he does it again and again and again till the final game.Because of all those completely random and irrational changes, I was simply unable to hate the ex-best-friend or sympathise with the protagonist! All I could see was a stupid writer forcing the characters to push the plot forward, against logic and common sense.And talking about logic and common sense, did I mention that the Squid Game is a secret organisation? Well, it is, kind of obviously. As mentioned before, the ""people"" behind it have an almost supernatural knowledge about everyone and nobody outside have any knowledge about it/them. Even so, the series introduces a subplot twist: there is a secret organisation operating inside the secret organisation, stealing and trafficking organs from the people that die in the games, without anyone in the Squid Game society noticing! Later, it's revealed that the Squid Game society actually knew that there was an organ trafficking group working behind the scenes, what makes even less sense, because how could a secret society infiltrate inside an even more secret society, and why would that society let such a huge liability operate freely inside it?The best character in the whole series is a random police officer that collects the protagonist's report about the Squid Game society when he gets out the first time. Despite not believing in his seemingly absurd story about a secret society playing deadly games, he tried to help him in all ways he could.I've heard that there will be a second season, but I don't want to watch it, because the protagonist is a schizophrenic jerk, the Squid Game society is made of dumb jerks (making people outside necessarily even dumber, as they can't figure them out) and the writer knows absolutely nothing about character development. Even if the producers would fix all those issues, what I absolutely doubt, the series would still be completely unwatchable, because either the protagonist stays the jerk anti-hero he'd been for most of the first season, or he'll be the jerk superhero, that abandoned his daughter for revenge, who he seemed to have become in the last few seconds of the last episode, that is, either way, he'll be a jerk."
273,Squid Game,"Finally finished this series. This is series is sticky, i mean it stick viewer toward, full of suspense, i really enjoy its game and i didn't expect that last game ends so easily in that's point i didn't satisfy. However i think they also made 2nd season after seeing its ending gin hun (lead character) didn't take the flight. GOOD series."
274,Squid Game,"I really don't know what all the fuss is about... The acting is strong (as expected from Korean actors and actresses) but most people are talking about the plot, which to me, is nothing special. Sure there are some plot twists but there are also way too many gaps for this to be called a ""classic"" or ""masterpiece""."
275,Squid Game,"I Felt like one or two episodes too long.Some were great and some too much monologue.Still pretty good TV version of battle Royal.Or perhaps a TV show of the movie ""Would you rather""."
276,Squid Game,"This show sucked me in on the first episode. The acting is superb and the plot is great. The only issue is the VIPs, that's where the acting is bad and writing fell apart. Luckily the VIPs are only in one episode so it doesn't ruin the entire series. I binged this on Netflix after watching one episode. Hoping for a season 2."
277,Squid Game,"It's a watchable series but not something that will make me watch a season 2. The cast is great, acting is good (except for the English speaking VIPs wearing masks). The personal stories of the contestants and how they interact between each other make the series more human than just a survival game. It does get bloody and somewhat violent as most survival game films do. So, one season is good enough for me."
278,Squid Game,"The story centers around 456 individuals who are in debt, and accepts the invite to play games for a chance at a large cash prize. Like Alice in Borderland, their lives are at stake. The tv series is great compared to Alice in Borderland. We can understand better where the characters are coming from, and what drives them as individuals. And the idea of deadly children's games is unexpected and refreshing. With each death of the main characters, some do feel sadness and disappointment. However, the tv series is not perfect, with my ability to predict who will win, who will be betrayed, and who is behind it all. And let's be honest, many of us were rooting for another person to win the prize. Anyways, I hope there will be a season 2, with the ""cliffhanger"" not being that shocking."
279,Squid Game,"Didn't expect to see exactly that what the movie is, but that was just the pleasant surprise. I like the idea of the people target to play the game, how they refuse, yet reinvolve - there is a message already in the first two episodes. As for how the show goes - good acting with great selection of casual-looking people, it holds its Asian manners, which is also his charm - brings their specific craziness and cruelty even, yet at some moments it is funny just as they can do it, but it is not a comedy at all. The entire show intends to bring a message, even after the outcome, it is a nice thing after so much gore. And happily, we don't see another unnecessary and intrusive homo love story.The scenes are captive, great colors and screen format, all the details are perfectly touched, the music nicely fits the acts. No wonder Squid Game is so popular, it simply deserves it."
280,Squid Game,"I really wanted to enjoy this series after all the hype, but just found it lacking in any real substance. There is a very linear story line, people in a lot of debt get invited to play some very basic games. Twist is, they get killed if they don't win. That's it. There is some initial shock during the first game, but that wanes as the series progresses. There are a some semi-interesting, but predictable back stories, and most of the characters have few, if any redeeming features, so you don't really care who survives. It is easy to be seduced by the initial shock of the first reveal, but it really doesn't progress much from there. I'd recommend. Midnight Mass on Netflix if you want some real horror."
281,Squid Game,I never got to watch any series after Mind hunter and Kingdom that kept me hooked. The Squid Game hits off right from the Episode 1. The series deals with all the aspects of human emotions especially GREED! This show cant be missed at any cost. This series deserves 10/10.
282,Squid Game,"Outstanding acting performance by ALL actors, so it looks realistic despite of the imaginary plot. People who hit rock bottom and have nothing to lose or that simply have no other choice take the very high risk of death hoping to win a kids game that will solve all their problems for good, or so they think. The only problem is that those who lose the game are killed immediately, so it's actually a game of life and death. Makes you think about the horrible life of the poor, who suffers with no future, while the wealthy enjoy."
283,Squid Game,"Overall I love the show. Great story, of the games. Few things I don't like....the acting is sub par and feels scripted. And the main character, you wanna like the main character. And I don't, he's a sleazy Grambling addict who is really a piece of garbage. I dont care whether he makes it or not. And overall this show makes Koreans seem....cringy. Horrible people."
284,Squid Game,"Loved this show, great story and idea. Though the acting is sub par. And up until the last 2 episodes you really want the main character to die. He was a gambling loser and then at the end he's the only person left that you want to win. Honestly the girl should have won....and then! At the very end...instead of taking his winnings and leaving. He goes back to...Do what? No one knows."
285,Squid Game,"It was very well acted . The male lead was excellent . I did figure out the main twist in the storyline , earlier on. I'm eagerly waiting for series 2 .I've watched South Korean movies for a number of years and have always enjoyed them .Their series Kingdom is fabulous too . Hollywood needs to learn from South Korea how to make good movies and series ."
286,Squid Game,"I am at the 3rd episode in a row! This is really entertaining in a good manner of modern Korean mystery dramas. Well done, usually I am quite skeptical about Netflix shows but this one is truly good one. Enjoy!"
287,Squid Game,"Solid drama with good story complexity and excellent character build up. Each episode is thrilling and heartwarming. Awesome series, one of the best series i have seen so far on netflix. Looking forward for Season 2."
288,Squid Game,"It is violent, contains plenty of gratuitous blood and gore, and features some amazing set designs and decent performances. Like any good game, Squid Game keeps you hooked until you get to the finishing line. There are a few questionable sub-plots - for instance, the undercover police officer who does absolutely nothing to stop the game - but the overall story holds up. Korean entertainment is here to stay."
289,Squid Game,"Masterpiece series
I remember old days game where play in childhood memories
I honey candy 🍭I recommend to watch atleast onceI waiting for more sessions."
290,Squid Game,"Brilliant Korean interpretation of Hunger Games + Prison Break + many other clever shows. Culturally fascinating, edge of the seat sweaty hand watching. I love it !"
291,Squid Game,I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE HYPE ABOUT IT... IT IS NOT INNOVATIVE AND DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PERFORMANCES IT'S JUST THE KOREAN VERSION OF DEADLY GAMES (WHICH ALWAYS IS MILLIONS OF TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT)
292,Squid Game,"I get the premise.. I get the idea.. I just don't get the acting. You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times.. like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale.. it's like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one).. how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one.. I give it points for originality but I hated the characters. They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better."
293,Squid Game,"What a amazing series from start to end ,really no words .best movie or serie regarding games .Korea took it in extream beauty level .so much lessons to learn by this series .I enjoyed more then money hesit season 3.4 and 5 .thx to Netflix showing or making series like that .hates off Korea and Netflix."
294,Squid Game,"A five for the main story a 1 for the ending, like people said it does try to somewhat act like ""SAW"" at some point.Also the subtitles was way off.If I had to watch again... I wouldn't
Some episodes was interesting, but most was not and like I said the ending was awful and doesn't make sense."
295,Squid Game,"The first couple of episodes a very well done and pack a punch, but by the end it just seems to run out of steam. The marbles episode was the last real swerve, after that it becomes paint by numbers to the point that I started fast forwarding through most of it just to get it to end.Early episodes are an eight, final episodes are a three."
296,Squid Game,"It's more than just a show or very strange idea from South Korea's minds, slowly with the characters development there will be a lot of questions about life in general and especially about being a human or not... and this is the strength of the show, yes as lot of viewers I didn't like that much the last 3 episodes mainly because of the introduction of some strangers...... otherwise it is a solid show."
297,Squid Game,Hope find season two and dad Sang Woo actor who sweetheart as mean characters . Go hun will fight evil guy offers him in danger play in games if Squid Game. Make girl's brother and Gi hun's daughter had met each other. Upset Sangwoo killed off.
298,Squid Game,"Good cast with a smart story. It's somewhat overly violent for shock's. If you pay attention to what's happening during the episodes you can guess how it's going to play out, and that's quite rare these days . Overall really good but the last two episodes was a little weak imo. It's seems that Koreans know how to entertain us, thank you !"
299,Squid Game,I am the first to admit I'm a lazy movie watcher and am not big on dubbing foreign movies or subtitles so when I kept hearing about Squid Game I was hesitant.This movie was amazing and was such a well written and interesting story.I've seen others bag the VIPs and I agree that was the weakest point of the show but hard to fault anything else.Can't wait for season 2.
300,Squid Game,"A hype is a hype is a hype... and our actual societys' Zeitgeist. The series is far away from the mentioned ""masterpiece"". Its starts very good, the first 3 parts are very enjoyable, but then it goes down quite quickly. Everything is far too obvious, from the beginning everything is so clear, not one single surprise to the end, and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline, the bad dialogues and the overacting. Furthermore full of plotholes, another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes. All in all nothing special."
301,Squid Game,"The success of the movie, ""Parasite"" has given RPG film makers brain freeze. If South Korean filmmakers hate Capitalism so much, its a short trip to North Korea. Meanwhile, horrible over acting. Inconsistent internal logic. Full of plot holes. Non violent scenes are devoid of entertainment and violent scenes are repetitious and disgusting."
302,Squid Game,"Everything is bad enough in Squid Game. But the most unbearable thing is to make us believe that this imaginary would not be ideological. But what we are shown is mostly a very bourgeois fantasy that man would be a wolf for man, that the game or the war allow to reinforce. Rancid and pathetic."
303,Squid Game,"Everything boils down to bad guys in South Korea. They're not Korean, or even Asian. They're European Caucasians. Get that. The only white people in this whole series are cast as the irredeemable bad guys. I'm sure it's just a coincidence."
304,Squid Game,"Squid Game is such a successful show that presented one-of-a-kind filmmaking elements that were never seen before. From its unique story to its visually stunning shots, the show deserved everything it got.The show really presented a powerful dramatic topic in the most beautiful way. You constantly be asking yourself who is right and who is wrong?. You get to see the different emotional decisions that characters have to go through to either sacrifice their lives or defend and protect themselves.Really loved how the show manifests the different characters and the diversity between them. It doesn't focus on one character, it rather focuses on around 7 different characters. You get to see the old, the young, the poor, the rich, the female, the male, and even the husband and wife. This makes the story even 10x better as we get to see everything and everyone's decision and how they react to these different games.I feel like the show was better when it was mysterious. As soon as things started to get revealed to us, the show lost itself and that mysteriousness vibe that it was offering. But, at the same time if things kept being mysterious, then the questions would've never been answered so the show would've been even worse. The show had plot holes and things that just didn't make sense at all. Like stupid decisions made by characters, or stupid character developments, or cheezy lines like the ones in ""English"" (and not Korean). Like why not keep everything in Korean?! Why do you have to add English dialogues and characters?!. But on the other hand, the show offered us many elements that covered these bad plot holes and made us not think about them as much as we think about the good stuff. For instance, the visually stunning set design with its beautiful colors that are matching perfectly together and with each game that they were playing especially they are meant to be for children so the bright pinky colors explain all of that. The custom designs as well alongside the masks gave that scary, suspense, and thriller atmosphere.The acting is beyond amazing. Each actor presented the dramatic side and life of their character perfectly and their acting plays a huge part in how we were easily connecting with each character. The acting of the VIPs was one of the worst things that I have ever seen.The show's 9 episodes are written very beautifully and carefully. This is why they turned to be great. The 2nd episode with its amazing title, ""Hell"" explains every back story. Although it was a boring episode, without it the show would've literally been nothing and the characters would've meant nothing. Really loved how the show presented a specific character that was quiet and didn't have any lines in the whole show except for one specific episode and we were easily connected emotionally to that character. It took the writer only one episode to make us connect deeply with the character that was quiet in previous episodes. That is enough to explain how each thing about this whole TV show was written with deep thinking and creativity.Finally, the beautiful music score is composed by Jung Jaeil, the same composer of Parasite (2019). You can hear the similarities between the two. Especially that both of them discuss such a sensitive and realistic topic which is greed, the difference between the poor and rich, and what people are willing to do for ""money"". The music score played an important role, especially in emotional scenes. They made these scenes way more emotional than they should be and added a lot of meaning to them.My rating is 8.5/10."
305,Squid Game,"This isnt one of them. There were some great characters, but sadly, they were wiped out til only the dregs remained. They dregs weren't much better than the English speaking vips that had to be the most poorly cast actors in the history of the universe. The end was fitting. Bleak. The movie was bleak. Bleak can be good, but there needs to be a point. There wasn't one here. I cared not a lick about those that remained. This was a terrible waste."
306,Squid Game,"The luckiest unlucky? The question, what does success mean to you? Just try to ask yourself after watching it. What a brilliant, dark, fun & fast paced show to demonstrate metaphor of capitalism. I would love to take this ride again. Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. The acting was pretty good and the story & plot was crazy. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality, honesty, sacrifice, smartness, cunningness and so on. Ending was somewhat predictable bht definitely a good show. I do recommend for you to watch it."
307,Squid Game,"What makes this show great, besides the amazing storyline and acting, is a glimpse into the Korean culture... and human nature. The human nature part is not a pretty sight, although we see the light in the darkness in some characters."
308,Squid Game,"Starts off pretty well in the first episode. Then it's just downhill and pointless. The ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crap
It turns out everything is dread, nothing has any meaning, and no one gets happy for anything. Doom, gloom and bad acting is all you get."
309,Squid Game,Great show with great twists. The only thing that I found bad was the VIP's terrible acting.The only Korean show that I have watched and it was amazing.
310,Squid Game,"Nessa analise me baseei em 5 importantes pontos: Enredo, desenvolvimento, personagens, estética e entretenimento.Enredo: 2/2
Desenvolvimento: 1/2
Estética: 2/2
Personagens: 1/2
Entretenimento: 2/2."
311,Squid Game,"1. If you are a fan of Violence and Thrilling Elements then this movie is for you.2. Produced with Highest Budget
3. No compromise on quality
4. No Compromise of script execution
5. Mix of Emotions, Action, Horror, Thriller. Spy and what else
6. Keeps you engaged throughout."
312,Squid Game,"Meh. Overrated. It keeps banging the same drum about what you'd do in a game if it was your life versus another's life. It's got a certain style, but the acting was amateurish and melodramatic. Sorta like anime."
313,Squid Game,"What is going on here? How can this show be praised like it is? This series is positively garbage...It's first degree from A to Z, the writing and acting are deplorable (oh the rotten discussions on the meaning of life!), the message distressingly banal, if not non-existent. Manichaeism in all its glory..The choice of music (Blue Danube from top to bottom) to emphasize the decadent atmosphere is pathetically heavy too. I really don't understand what people can find in this interstellar piece of trash that looks like it was written and directed by an 8 year old child, considering how subtle is it.Nothing is credible, everything is predictable, the characters are caricatures (OMG, the ""VIPs""...)What's the so-called great political and social message? That people will do anything for money? That's the great originality of the thing, seriously?I haven't seen anything that ridiculous or grotesque for a long time."
314,Squid Game,"One of the well-made, and original shows. The highlights: its writing, creative direction, Large and beautiful set design, character developments, and an uncovering of the truth of Humanity. Though it is not for faint-hearted people as it is brutal and disturbing in many ways still A masterpiece that every movie premyy should watch. Highly Recommended! ❤"
315,Squid Game,"My biggest problems was how main character has been portrayed. He was detestable. First 10 minutes of the show and I really, really, really wanted to punch the guy in the face and turn off the show.The show kinda uses dirty trick to make him less what he was portrayed as and more relatable. This effect was the strongest on 6th episode, Gganbu, which was also the best one out of all 9.In all honesty i had to force myself to watch first 3 episodes and they totally failed to hook me in. I only kept on watching because otherwise i'd feel like I wasted 3 hours for nothing. Sunk cost fallacy.I am kind of glad that I did. Kind of.At episode 5 things got slightly better. 6th was the best, the peak of the show and after that it was slow and weird fall. Yeah, episode 7, 8 and 9 were weird to say the least.The issues: The playgrounds and props look cheap. Director tried to imitate 'hunger games'... things (episode 7 onwards) but... boy, oh boy.. It's just bad. Fake blood was downright insulting.. While some scenes were brutally real. Like DUDE, decide. Want me to be grossed out with fake CGI blood stain, or puke my guts out?!The games are weird and some of them make little sense difficulty-wise, while others are made so unfair I just scratch my head ""what was the point other than playing SAW movie on us?"". Seriously some of those games a blender with nails and glass would be safer place than whatever they came up with.Ending, without any spoilers... Here's the thing: Koreans to my knowledge LOVE unhappy/sad endings. It seems they just need to be beaten down emotionally. I seriously do not remember the last Korean movie that didn't end up sad for the sake of sad. And because it's a 9-episode long show, the ""sad ending"" phase is stretched quite a bit. Not gonna lie, I did feel like my eyes got teary, but it was annoying, rather than earned.Should you watch it... Did you like saw (and/or dont mind gore)? If so, go ahead. Do you have netflix? If so... eh, sure.I wish i could just tell you to watch episode 6.. but without knowing the characters and their relationship... Eh it's either all or none case, sadly. I will definitely not bother with season 2 if we ever gonna get one."
316,Squid Game,"The sereal started very interesting. You dont know why happening this, who is behind this, and what kind of child game thay will play. But after episode 7 when the vip-s arrived, the whole concept are turnd up side down. All the serial become predictible, like im feeling my self as a precog. Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever. That makes from 8 star to 7. But is still a good seral. A new type of battle royale. But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived. Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star. And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting."
317,Squid Game,"The first episodes hit you like a hard punch in the stomach. Original and well produced series. Disturbing, bizarre and unpredictable. Many very good characters with the big exception of the VIP people that were very bad acting. Korean filmmakers show more and more their ability to make high quality dramas. You are kept on the edge of your seat for the first half of the series. Then it loses some steam and focus. The ending a bit disappointing and the opening for a second seasons feels totally unncessary. One season is enough and it is a very good watch for the not-faint-hearted-viewers."
318,Squid Game,"As in the title says, this show is great. Already people made detailed comments and I won't have anything futher to add. But I'd like to point out two things.First one is complaints about predictability. I strongly disagree that view. Until the last second of the game, you'll be wondering who is going to be the winner. Because the balance between characters is consistenly changing thanks to great storytelling and it makes you reconsider who deserves to win during the entire show.Second thing is apparently people annoyed by the performances of VIP actors. It's true, VIP actors are really b type movie actors yet they have very short amount of screen time. Therefore it doesn't affect the overall experience in my opinion. If you're a person who has watched many other asian productions like me, it won't be a problem at all. Whenever a British or American actor is being seen on Asian movies (both chinese and Korean), you'll find their performance laughable anyways. Actors here reminds me IP Man 2. Regardless this is not a serious issue to lean on.In short, don't miss it out and believe the hype. Definitely deserves to watch."
319,Squid Game,So dumb. I don't understand all the hype. I could only watch this with one finger on the Fast Forward button.And now i have to come up with 150 characters to complete this review.
320,Squid Game,"Hwang Dong-hyuk's thrilling, hyper-violent, unique Korean TV series steaming now on Netflix is one of the most original and gripping shows ever produced for the medium. Taking place in South Korea, it concerns people who are in serious financial ruin that receive a mysterious invitation to compete in a series of children's game at a secret location that could earn the sole winner the ultimate prize of millions of dollars in cash, but the catch is you have a certain amount of time to succeed, and the losers are brutally executed on the spot. The series' lead protagonists are Seong, sensationally played by Lee Jung-Jae, a divorce gambling addict with a lovely young daughter who is in deep debt to some vicious loan sharks, his childhood friend Cho Sang-woo, superbly played by Park Hae-soo, who was the golden boy of the neighborhood that went to a prestigious business university, and now his wanted by the police for embezzling great sums of money from clients of the company he worked for, a beautiful young pickpocket named Kang Sae-byeok, impressively played by Jung Hoyeon, who needs the money for her baby brother who is in an orphanage, a Pakistani migrant worker, Ali Adul, terrifically played by Anupam Tripathi, who is on the run and is desperate for money to support his infant child and beloved wife, a sickly old man, Oh ll-nam, endearingly played by Oh Yeong-su, who has nothing to lose, and a murderous criminal, Jang Deok-su, memorably played by Heo Sung-tae, who is on the run from killer gangsters. Marvelously directed by Dong-hyuk, it has a truly engrossing screenplay by Hwang Dong-hyuk, stunning cinematography by Lee hyeong-Deok, and incredibles sets. This highly addictive show had me and my dear wife on the edge of our seats, the suspense is almost unbearable at times. We cannot want for season two to get here. Highly recommended."
321,Squid Game,"I really enjoyed this show. There are some weak moments, too much explanatory dialogue, the acting can get pretty cheesy a few times, but overall it's fantastic. I loved the ending, too, not sure why so many people seem to dislike it."
322,Squid Game,"Hands down superb, if you aren't a fan, then you aren't a fan of Korean cinema. And you most likely watched this with English subs because of social media's hype. Go back to gavin and Stacey if that's the case."
323,Squid Game,"A battle royale-style concept that's been done many times in different forms (e.g., Alice in Borderland, 3%, Hunger Games, etc.), but there's just something in the way that Korean artistic style makes even the most cliched story lines interesting again. The first episode felt a little sluggish, but gets going by the end, and boy does it get going!The show is thoroughly enjoyable and gripping to watch, but gets predictable towards the end. Not only that, I think the writers ran out of shocking novel ideas about how to stage the namesake game in the end. But by then, you may just appreciate the relief of a straight-forward conclusion.Definitely binge-worthy! Though they could make a sequel/season 2, I don't think they should--it doesn't really need it, nor leaves you wanting more."
324,Squid Game,Terrible voice actor in the main character. Childish. Stopped watching. Subtitles are better.
325,Squid Game,"There's a lot to compare with Squid Game, because there are some obvious similarities to Battle Royale but different enough.The good: the contestants are fantastic, the script, and acting are first rate and it's impossible not to get attached. I like the simplicity of it: people want money, they compete in deadly games to get it. There are opportunities to leave, but the need for all that money is greater than risking their life. The bases are pretty well covered. Visually it's like a demented Dr Seuss story. Loved the sets!The bad (or, the picky): the VIP's are stupid with horrible acting, everything the rest of the show isn't. The surprise ending is cool, but the explanation is pretty lacking for a show with tons of detail. I guess they can use season 2 for this. As a stand-alone you have to just accept that someone has the money and imagination to put together such an elaborate and secretive series of games for the benefit of a few bored rich people. And the workers? No explanation how the control is there at all."
326,Squid Game,"Anwar Says : Last week, there was absolutely nothing to watch on Hindi OTT and I decided to go for much talked about Squid Game on Netflix, a Korean dark and disturbing series. 9 long episodes and would force you for a binge watch.You have everything in the plot , childhood games , killing, inhumanity, hatred , emotions, sentiments , and above all mind game . Out of 456 contestants, all down with debts are ready to sacrifice their lives to earn money, sounds a familiar subject but the Netflix team has converted it to unnerving deadly battle.Premise is simple and the characters are introduced quite fast but smoothly. If you loose you are killed and your guessing is not correct every time. Don't want to be a spoiler, so not narrating the story and the games .The lead Lee Jung- Jae gets answers to all his questions in the last episode.Watch the series with sub- titles on , in spite of the fact the dubbing in English is of quality par excellence . The masked jump- suits used by the guards are going to be the favourite this Halloween . Already running at top spot since a fortnight.9 out of 10 from me .#Nerflix

327,Squid Game,"What a Beautiful show this was!.. It'll make you think about yourself, the people, life & everything else that 'matters'.. &🥂Cheers to everyone involved in this amazing show you all did a really amazing job Everything was just Top Notch!🎭✨Negatives : 1. A bit predictable but still i was
hooked.2. The dialogues (& acting) of VIPs
was cringe.I've seen so many movies & shows from South Korea & they never disappoint do they!?P. S. For the haters - 'Hating on popular things doesn't make you a cool or interesting person' XD."
328,Squid Game,"How is this currently on a score of 8.2? The lead character was SO annoying in the first 30 minutes that I switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through.It's not a patch on either Battle Royale or the American version of that, Hunger Games.It drags on and on and on, and the ending is just flat.Watch it if you must because of the binge/hype value, but it has little to offer any serious film buff."
329,Squid Game,"Everyone gave their best except for the VIPS.Great series to watch
Hats off to the director!"
330,Squid Game,"TV made for violent lowbrows. Parasite was rubbish, this is even worse."
331,Squid Game,"The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time. It sure knows how to play around with the viewer's emotions. It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways.Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you.Great Character development - CheckPerfect Casting - CheckPerfect screenplay and progression - CheckA brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices.And that's what the show is all about. The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world.I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions."
332,Squid Game,It seems to me that too many Humans with not much of the grey matter are such Gullible People getting excited about this absolute Rubbish.Try getting outside a bit more People????
333,Squid Game,"No spoiler here, just a recommendation. In my mind it's only 8 episodes long. Episode 8 is short, so just add 20 mins of episode 9 on top of it, and stop at the moment it says ""X amount of time later!"" Nothing else worth your time after then, the next 40 minutes serves to be quite damaging, as far as the story is concerned. The end point I recomend is really appropriate. Well, go past that point, but just pretend that segment is part of a bad dream!"
334,Squid Game,"Saw films, Gantz anime, Alice In Borderland tv series, High Rise Invasion manga, and more have done this formula. Some of which have done this formula better.The only thing that Squid Game adds new, is that it is South Korea's own take on it, with a kdrama spin.At max, this is a 6 star at best, and a 2 star at its' worst. I'm just not as entertained, compared to other kdramas and survival game narratives (as listed above)."
335,Squid Game,I seriously don't know what the hype is all about. Is it because people get killed while playing a game? Is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey? Because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better.To me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long.
336,Squid Game,"...and I couldn't even finish it.Maybe it gets good; I don't know, as it has so much hype and good reviews.I just know it's not for me.The main character is so unlikeable that I don't care what happens to him. Maybe he grows as a character...he probably does, but I don't care enough to stick around to see.The acting is over the top. The main character pulls faces every two minutes. I've seen better acting in high school plays, but maybe a lot is missing in the translation.If I ever watch the rest I'll come back and write a better review but for now, this is a hard pass."
337,Squid Game,The production was done quite well. Love the direction. Cinematography was on point. Actors did a good job. That being said the story really starts to take a turn for the worst towards the end. Branched storylines resulted in dead ends. The failed attempt at trying to be artistic and deep was quite cringe worthy in the finale. Would i watch S2? 50/50.
338,Squid Game,Honestly Netflix can not make many good American shows without a bunch of woke politics and other trash. This show is god damn amazing!!! Its so dark and twisted.
339,Squid Game,"09/12/2021,
NetflixI was meaning to watch the squid game for days due to the insane hype it created here at my place. I always expected it to be a sort of highly intelligent game show kind of film but when I finally sat watching the first episode, I definitely know it is going to be another parasite.Again, I don't hate parasite, in the same way, I don't hate this series. Squid game had a good pace with it, not once I felt bored and I really admired the effort that these film makers have put in to the show but, BUT, the series, same as the film, was insanely dark, disturbing and hopeless.I mean, why do you have to create such series and pour in more negativity into this world? Don't you have enough? I think this is the problem with not only this but most of the Korean films/dramas, called to be 'thrillers' these days and the fact that these inhumane shows get widespread acclaim is horrifying and making me question the future of this world.Judgements aside, the series also had major flaws like crappy characters, predictable tale telling and confusing logic. At times, you cannot find motives for a character's action at all. Some characters had no back story, no arc, no depth, even though they were prioritized over other disposable characters.I mean, do these people ever think what will happen if they get killed? With what hope, they are entering the game show? What are the odds' of having multiple winners? Did they really choose to return even after watching a bloody massacre in front of their eyes? Did they really think that these people can be trusted after watching that?Coming to the male lead, Who leaves their sick mom for days/months to play a dangerous game in the hopes of winning money and returns hoping that she would be alive? What are the chances of winning the game (1 out of 456)? Did they really think they will have multiple winners? Which game has that?Do any of these characters live for themselves? If the characters are so sentimental towards their loved ones, why risk their own lives in the first place? Would the loved ones think that the money is better than the loss of their children/parents?Why did the female lead leave her only brother to play the game when she had no debts? She could have lead a good life here in South Korea making peace with her mind that she cannot see her mom again. Did she really think that her mom would be happy after coming to SK and to know that her only daughter is dead? What were the odds that after the escape, her mom would still be left alive in NK? Did she put her entire life in danger, trusting on some blind instincts?Now that I think of this series, there were so many things that didn't make sense or plainly were there to psychologically torture the characters. The series, as parasite did, left my heart with a hollow and I'm stressed out. Like life is not stressful enough.I'm alarmed at the ratings that this weak show has been given and seriously feel frightened of this sadist community, who I know will not dare to kill anyone if the dystopian future arrives. I'll rather take my own life than to play a people killing game like this."
340,Squid Game,"I hate Netflix with all my soul, but was surprised by the superb concepts and style of Squid Game, with human, complex characters, and plot. I can honestly say I found the show brilliant at times, with honest, raw emotion present, intertwined with unflinching violence, and more than capable actors turning in poignant and nuanced performances. I loved it. Until the very last episode. The pacing was off, multiple twists that just didn't seem to fit, and just a tone and feel that felt way off after 8 episodes. I would have given this a 9 or maybe even a 10 if the final episode had been..more fitting. I still give it a solid 8/10. Great show."
341,Squid Game,"There was a new Korean series on Netflix and I didn't really care. But it didn't take long before I started hearing about it from all sides, and only in a good way. So I decided to watch this series and I don't regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn't anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it."
342,Squid Game,"I have no complaints about the story of Squid Game or the violence and gore in the story, it's actually done rather tactfully throughout, showing just enough here and there to make it worthwhile and fun to watch.The acting is top form in all respects, every portrayal is perfect and heart-wrenching in places in both how perfectly its shown and how decent it's made .Even the sets are painstakingly jarring and off-putting, that. ""relativity"" style primary colour hallway set is so jarringly off-putting and decently alluring at the same time, I knew on first seeing it that I'd love the set decoration and propworks.So why after all this gushing for how wonderfully amazing this is am I not giving it a 10/10?Because I want this series to be literally just this, a 9 episode story of a down-on-his-luck man with decent ambitions who goes through hell only to come out on the other side as a hero.But that ending man, that ending...the sequel bait in it is thick as 10 week in the snow syrup. And I don't want that, I don't want Gi-hun to become some warrior trying to take down the international Squid Game people. Let this be the amazing single season it is that shows even the lowest man can become something amazing when given the chance."
343,Squid Game,Ok..it's entertaining for sure...but plot wise it does not make sense..at the end ( spoilers). It's about how can they treat people the way they do.. forgetting the fact the contestants chose to be there and could leave anytime they liked..they knew the rules and decided to play ..so why the suddeb blame on the host of the games?..all in all it's fun.. expect a few remakes from bigger better film studios..
344,Squid Game,"Regardless of the plot, subject matter, etc, this was overall some of thee best acting I've ever seen. Keep in mind I'm disregarding the VIPs lol. But this movie is making me feel things I absolutely did not expect at all going into this, lol. I feel ""truth"" from almost every main cast member. Honestly, it's a brilliant performance and, if it were a movie and shot to be a movie, I'd see it making waves in American mainstream similar to Train to Busan. A+++ to the actors, wow, the character arcs in this are awesome to watch."
345,Squid Game,"I watched two episodes and I had enough. There's nothing here, terrible acting, unoriginal concept (I've seen a half dozen movies that resemble this series). I honestly do not understand what the hype is about, the only thing I can guess is that the producers and Netflix paid a huge amount of money to market this show. I see a LOT of Stanley Kubrik wanna be here, from the masks (Eyes Wide Shut), the music (On the Beautiful Blue Danube) the surrealism (The Shining), the gore (A Clockwork Orange), and there is nothing wrong with being influenced or even try to imitate art, however this series is simply too weak and Kubrik's imitation is a failure in my opinion. If anyone is impressed by this then they must be watching reality TV all day long."
346,Squid Game,There's a lot of blood and violence in my opinion. I often wonder which is the more accurate one. Does blood gush out if a bullet pierces a person and how much. Is it like tiny not visible droplets that couldn't be caught on camera and then there's blood pouring from the wound I doubt it's a splatter fest.The social commentary was elsewhere too but I found the voting scene most fascinating. How half of the players wanted to get the money and risk their life. I get that many of the players were desperate but can't these people get even a litt paying job rather than play in the squid game. I'll rather work at a McDonald's than risk my life.
347,Squid Game,"I feel conflicted after finishing the series. After watching the 3rd episode I was hooked! Just absolutely amazing! A solid 10! I'm glad there were only 9 episodes. At this moment I'm not sure exactly when it started going wrong. I agree with others, the VIPs were awful and cliche. And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh."
348,Squid Game,"If you liked any Black Mirror episode, imagine this series is 10 times better. Perversion, simplicity, emotion, action and drama, all in 1 package. A must watch."
349,Squid Game,It was an ok watch to start with but then each episode just dragged and dragged on making it quite drawn out and boring. Should have made it into a 5/6 episode series. Doubt i'll watch another series if they make one.
350,Squid Game,"Answer: Do not know. Binged through the 9 episodes .Mixed feelings mixed opinions , mixed reactions,
Excessively brutal and violent yet all the brutality and violence hides a hidden agenda for everyone to interpret as he/she wishes. As I watched the English dubbed version with Hebrew subtitles I can only say that the subtitles often differed from the dubbed English ,hence i believe that the translated subtitles are more close to the original Korean version that the dubbing. The main character actors give a reasonable performance while some others should keep their day jobs.So is it worth watching?-See the Subject line. I would rate it 0/10 and 8/10 at the same time. Hence I am giving it a 4."
351,Squid Game,"An excellent series on the critique of capitalism and money worship in the world and the current world of Korea (South). The series clearly challenges capitalist society, saying that the poor (participants here) are the slaves of the rich (here the game makers). As the main character clearly says somewhere: ""You (the poor) bet on the horses and we (the rich) bet on you! You are our horses! The main goal of the series is the critique of capitalism in the form of these."" Fascinating, exciting and breathtaking matches that managed to reach their goal well and become the most watched series in the history of Netflix to date, which is true, I suggest you watch it."
352,Squid Game,"I don't watch many foreign shows or movies, but with all the popularity surrounding this show I just had to watch it. ""Squid Game"" is a very engaging show that keeps you hooked in with its various twists and surprises that keep you watching. While the last episode failed to satisfy some aspects of the series, it still wrapped things up nicely and did a great job of showing the consequences of a society were the rich are the only ones who benefit. Very excited for season two."
353,Squid Game,"It's really nice esthetically pleasing. But you have to like testosterone movies sadistic and so on . So yes Pasolini did better with.salo 120 days of salo ..
But new generation forgot about this...."
354,Squid Game,"It becomes one of successfully Korean dramas. Besides the brutal element, the setting of each game involves lot of tactics, eg composition of the team, your partner, sequence etc.. which determine your success rate. There is nothing relevant to distasteful Saw game! Plus all of them participate in the game on a voluntary basis!Another thing I like most is about character development. All main characters' acting are excellent, and the supporting roles like snake tattoo, Pakistan contestants are also competent. It reminds me of Busanhaeng! However, these foreigners VIP acting are so embarrassing.Just a bit strange. Gi-Hoon personality setting difference before and after participating in the game is too much. In the past, he was kind of greedy gambler. However he suddenly ends up like a superhero with full of truth and justice. If you don't want to use the money, it's better to donate it. So comparatively Sang-Woo character is more consistent. All in all, I did enjoy it from the beginning till the end."
355,Squid Game,"I enjoyed this show it was very interesting to see. This show was intense from start to finish. First, of all the first episode with the red light green light game caught my attention. I had no idea anyone was going to play it with guns so that was wild. Second, camera angles were dope, however shaky camera work some scenes. I also loved the acting and the character development and attachment came so easy with this show. Finally, I loved the story of this show and connections and betrayals. This show was relatable and shows how society in the long run will look out for their own interests while there is still a few good things about humanity as well. Thank you for the show."
356,Squid Game,"Honestly, i skipped the story of the player's background. But when the game began to play with all the gripping game stage, its excited me. This serial is a mix between the Hunger Games and Saw. You'll never expect whose the boss of all deadly games, if you already watched Saw movies, then you'll know."
357,Squid Game,"If you are wondering if this show is worth of all the hype, it is.Just a few flaws for me: the cop sub plot feels silly; and as usually in korean dramas, when they need white characters (the VIPs here - by the way, could you imagine a US show were all the villains would be POC?) they cast the same bunch of untalented dudes. Their acting is so bad that i really wonder if they are truly actors or if there are just white dudes livng in Korea."
358,Squid Game,"""Squid Game"" is one of the best Netflix shows to come out in a long time. It's a truly twisted yet inventive show filled with amazing performances and terrifying situations.This show truly kept me engaged throughout all its 9 episodes. The characters are absolutely amazing. Each character is truly fleshed out in their own ways making you care about some yet hate others. The acting is amazing. Each actor gives a commented, realistic, and terrified performance, and it feels real. The games too are very fun to watch. Some are quick and fast, while others are slow and terrifying. It's a very inventive premise for a show. Also the show truly made me cry. It's a show that succeeds at making you love characters too much. And that will result in you crying at certain things that happen in the show. The show also just has a real look at what it's like living in debt. It's makes you think whether it's worth it to risk your life to get money.I have but ONE little issue with the show. The first 2 episodes are just a little slow. I feel that they could've been better paced, but that's it.""Squid Game"" is a truly amazing show that has amazing performances, fleshed out characters, a real look at reality, and a premise that's so creative that it's almost impossible to enjoy."
359,Squid Game,"I think this series is great and different experience for all the entertainment lovers.. Only lacks at emotional elements cause i think it would be great if they develop more moments..
Otherwise this is entertaining at many portions.. Stretched at some portions.. Thrilling at time.. Horror in elements and emotional in parts!!"
360,Squid Game,"The main characters are all unlikable, in the extreme. And all the acting is terrible, and voice acting in translation somehow even worse.I have no idea how this became a success."
361,Squid Game,"When you watch S01E06 (""Gganbu""), make sure you have a box of tissues next to you... and preferably also somebody to hug."
362,Squid Game,"Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It's basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It's basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much ""micromanagement"" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it's really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the ""micromanagement"" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot."
363,Squid Game,"This show shows us the hypocrite nature of humans and how they can turn into monsters when the things come to money & self life.But at some instances the plot was predictable like in E2 (voting stops at 100-100 and the last man will decide the result), the front man turns to be the police officers brother and the last episode ended at such an anti-climatic note (sang woo kills himself for what? After returning from game Gi hun forgets about his daughter for whom he wants to be a good father)"
364,Squid Game,Overrall it is a good show and the only concern i had was the acting it felt so cringy and annoying at the same time and i skipped so many scenes bcz of very poor acting.
365,Squid Game,"I've watched a ton of Korean series and films and to say this was good is overstating.The premise, the storylines are nothing new, it's been done a lot over the years.Just has more CGI Bells and Whistles.Sorry, but I can't recommend this slop.Easy to figure out that The Front Man was the cop's brother...
Lots of blood and headshots...
I was stunned that the bathroom sex scene was there...
None of the characters made you actually like them or pull for them...
If they make another season...that's punishment enough."
366,Squid Game,"I loved everything about this show, very engaging and stressful, yet it depicts human emotions to the fullest. Gambling on a horse race will never feel that easy anymore."
367,Squid Game,Great show. Brilliant acting. Apart from the VIPs who thankfully had a small part otherwise they could have overshadowed a fantastic show. The bureaus are great screenwriters and I hope this introduces people to the brilliance of Korean filmmaking (start with Train to Busan!)
368,Squid Game,"I found this drama to be well executed and entertaining.Were there bad plot holes?Yes.Did the VIPs episode suck?Yes.But did that hinder the overall series?No.Because, this drama, despite its gruesome violence, is pretty light. It doesn't have a deeper message nor a plot that makes you stop and think a lot. At one point, it's just a game and you even stop feeling for whoever that dies.Pros:
Good actingThe childish games with a twist were funLight plot, easy to follow.Uncomplicated charactersStellar castCons:
VIPs episodePoliceman's story line, how he gets into a highly secured center being undetected was unrealistic, also how come his phone battery lasted for 6 days without dying?Characters did not have much depth (except for the girls and Ali)Anyway, I have been watching kdrama for a while now, and I should say Squid Game is not the best kdrama I have seen. But it definitely is not the worst. It's a fun ride. With awesome OSTs and BGs. Everyone should check this out."
369,Squid Game,"Squid Game deserves its hype overall but is still marred by glaring inconsistencies and poor story-telling. One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it. It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning. Seven more things that compromise the story are:1. The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below. Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game.2. The Front Man is Jun Ho's missing older brother. You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent. Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?3. With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?4. A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game. Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo. Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself. This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead. What an anticlimax.5. Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor's guilt, leaving Sang Woo's mom saddled with her son's debt and Sae Byeok's brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year.6. Squid Game started in 1988. Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows. Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters.7. The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America. Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games. How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like. If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator. End scene. Better set-up for season 2 instead of some irresponsible father letting his kid down again."
370,Squid Game,"Very original, very strange. I like strange. Ooh look at this, it is so cute and harmless like a puppy until it bites off your index finger."
371,Squid Game,"Good idea and first episode but by episode 4 i'd had enough. Too weird, violent and unlikeable characters."
372,Squid Game,"Sure, it's a complete rip-off of a Japanese classic movie but it's still one of the most imaginative and visually stunning shows this year.Love it.Watch it!"
373,Squid Game,"Absolutely brilliant! Loved it from start to finish, excellent acting (apart from the American actors at the end! Dreadful) Great story, had me hooked.. binged watched the lot!Looks like they'll be a second series which I can't wait to see! Superb."
374,Squid Game,"I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue)."
375,Squid Game,"First off, if you are starting this show, please give it the respect it deserves and watch the original Korean version with the English subtitles. A lot of people can be incredibly lazy when it comes to foreign films/TV shows. Avoid the American dubbed version like the plague. Now, onto the shoe itself which was an absolute blast from start to finish. Believe the hype, it genuinely is that brilliant and the acting is on point. The characters are very well developed and you start to grow to like certain characters as the series unfolds. It's over the top violence and a little far fetched, but you are watching a TV series for entertainment, not to be educated. For all the 1* reviews. Ignore them. These are people that deliberately don't rate a show because it's popular and trend. Yes, it can be annoying when a show suddenly becomes huge and everyone jumps on the bandwagon, but don't let that put you off. It's one of the best series Netflix has produced in years. Highly recommended."
376,Squid Game,"This show has a great script, excellent actors, but fails to keep the viewers interested, because it is really slow. I often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer, adding very little to the plot. This show could easily have 6 episodes, and that would improve a lot its entertaining value."
377,Squid Game,I don't get why people love it. Simply put it's saw but these people are willing to risk death. The over acting is annoying and not sure what the actual words are but the English dub is painful and out of touch with what is going on in the movie.
378,Squid Game,"The show, for the most part, was good. A few dinky plot holes but I can live with that. The characters, however, are not good people nor are they redeemable. Normally, no likable characters completely kills a show for me. Alas, it's hooked me in enough I want to see where the story goes from here. So I guess they won."
379,Squid Game,"Pros: acting, art direction, visuals, detailed storytelling
Cons: filler scenesWith more than a decade in making, Director Hwang Dong-hyuk has nailed this series, possibly allowing for more Korean creators to explore this genre.The acting by many of the characters in the show has been phenomenal. Their backstories were believable and emotional because of the emotions they conveyed (if being watched with original Korean audio + English subtitles, instead of English dub).The artistic design throughout the movie was aesthetically pleasing and creative as color choices in many scenes are intentionally done. And with that being said, the attention to detail carries this show beautifully.The only complaints while watching were the filler scenes; making the show feel as though it's dragging at some points. Some complained about the acting of the VIPs, but I think that was intentionally done by the creators."
380,Squid Game,"What's with all the hype??My biggest problem with this are the characters. I just don't care for them, very two dimensional and not very well drawn.The concept is nothing ground breaking. Seen it done before and better. Also don't bother with the dubbed audio, you'll end up laughing.Found myself bored in quite a few of the episodes also.Overall, I just didn't care, not the worst thing I've ever seen but nowhere's near worthy of the hype it received."
381,Squid Game,"It's hard to understand the killing by numbers appeal - it's expressive and shocking and bizarre, but mass-murder is mass-murder. Whatever the plot, it's just unnecessary and fairly uninventive after first shot - once you understand the game rules and one person breaks them and gets shot, the rest is the same dull murderous routine for another 5 minutes.At the same time it's hard to sympathise thieves and gamblers - their lifestyle is by no means a death verdict, but they're not a relatable bunch either. Plus the acting is terrible, maybe save the old man, the Indian guy and the masked folks as long as they're wearing the masks.Cinematography good though, and maybe there's a great reveal up ahead - but I'm very reluctant to go past episode 3 for the reasons above."
382,Squid Game,As we enter I don't know the 10th lockdown in my country thanks to the coronavirus and its variants dropping sequels and prequels every so often I finally decided to check it out and see what the hype is about.Literally finished the show start to finish ! Edge of the seat type of show.The plot itself is simple but the direction the screenplay and the casting ..mind blowing !
383,Squid Game,"It is worth watching.The first season was awesome. Interesting concept. The problem is, that a lot of it is predictable."
384,Squid Game,"5th episode is in, so far I haven't seen a higher level of violence and gore that I was expecting to see. It's a survival game genre TV show, but it hasn't been living up to its premise yet. Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It's simply because people can't understand what's going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary. One more thing, it was really nice to see an indian actor as one of the main characters in the show. I know It's not a lot, but still it adds a lot of positive effects in the show."
385,Squid Game,"Nothing more than a Korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc. Terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes.Probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy, Anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time."
386,Squid Game,"This show isn't as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. It's definitely entertaining to watch, but it doesn't have any more substance to it than that. Maybe because I've watched this after the ""raging hype"", but I personally don't think this is a new concept at all.The acting is decent and it's filmed well, but my rating went down from 7 to 6, due to the explanation we're given as to why the games exist in the first place.Perhaps a lot of the viewers haven't seen Battle Royal and generation Z have only just discovered violent asian cinema."
387,Squid Game,"What's Good- Yes, concept and plot of this survival drama is not a new thing, but the way it conveys with conviction has no match.It is high intense drama of human emotions like fear, greed, worrying, anxiety and humanity. Like in 'parasite', it again shows social inequality issues of South Korea.The series is a high-quality work and It's visuals are strong to build suspense very effectively.Recommending to watch original Korean audio with English subtitles. And yes, it can be addictive one to binge watch!"
388,Squid Game,The show is a must watch. Would have made it a 10 were it not for the VIPs. I don't understand why they came into the show so late. You figure they would have liked to see it from the beginning to quench their thirst for seeing people suffer but they didn't. They should have just cut them out of the script. Otherwise an excellent series.
389,Squid Game,"1-6 built strong momentum.Ep 7 brought in talkative bad English speaking actors that completely killed the mystery and the momentum the show was building. The show would have been smarter to keep them all silent and have them look tough and mysterious. The moment they started opening their mouths and started walking, they looked and sounded like average American Joes with average intelligence and an average strut. The show died there.Ep 8 Predictable progression, predictable ending, boring.Ep 9 total waste of time. Just drags on for too long."
390,Squid Game,This series has a really good storyline.You think you know how an episode goes. But it always takes a different turn.It has been very well thought out.Well done and i would say check it out!
391,Squid Game,"I saw this drama cause I am a Kdrama lover .But it was not for me. From the first till the last episode was reproduced violence in every way. Sexual, verbal ,physical, just plain, coarse ,cruel and bloody-minded violence. Absolutely not reccomended to everyone under the age of 18.Regarding the plot , there was some parts with no reason. For example the whole story about the policeman was just unnecessary as he was not involved with the main characters.In my opinion only the last episode tried to ""save"" the whole disturbing face of the drama showing a more human side , and giving the moral message that money don't bring happiness."
392,Squid Game,"One would think that a miniseries centered around a gameshow would be stale after a while, but this series is top notch. I did think some elements of the story were hard to grasp, however the show was suspenseful and included an interesting range of characters.The only downside for me was the finale. I would have expected more character development from GiHun."
393,Squid Game,"If you liked Alice in Borderland then this is a good bet! Likable (well most of them) characters, suspenseful and just a fun concept in general."
394,Squid Game,"Good theme, but story developed in a bad way. POOR DIRECTION
Idle for 2hr movie release than that of an 9episode series."
395,Squid Game,"Pros
* interesting premise
* atmospheric
* some of the acting is very well done
* some character development is well doneCons
* character personalities change at random
* some over the top acting
* some overly stereotypical characters
* premise doesn't have any real foundation
* it ignores the potential sociocultural insightPros
The story underneath it all is an interesting one. The same general idea isn't a unique one (eg. It's similar to Brazil's ""3%""), but the my build in enough sub-plots, mystery, and kind of cliffhanger endings, for it to have a fair bit of intrigue.The setting also works. Real life scenes in the city are mostly either dark or grey, contrasting with the childlike bright colours and symbols of the games. It's definitely quirky and somewhat atmospheric.Cons
But that's all let down by some weak acting, annoying voice actor in the English dubbed version, and characters either who are too stereotypical or whose personalities change in a whim.There's some decent acting and character development as well, but it's way overdone (exaggerated facial expressions and 'tantrums') by the main character and a several of the stereotypical ones are where the acting is really overdone.By the end, when they start revealing the motivations behind it all;m, it gets pretty weak, stereotypical (again), and exaggerated.In addition to this, there's so much potential for a political or sociocultural commentary. So much scope to address the changes in kids habits (from active and interactive physical and outdoor games and the creativity of making up new ones, to iPad and PC screens all day long). And more so, to address the poor dying and struggling to survive to make money that for most is never actually within their grasp, while the rich do nothing but exploit them. (The latter is what ""3%"" does really well). But the dialogue doesn't really touch on the issues at all. More focus on blood and guts than on any potential insight.Overall, too many characters make no sense, and it ultimately feels hollow in the end."
396,Squid Game,Literally gave this a 9/10 all because of how intensely obsessed i am with 067 and 240. That's it and that's all.
397,Squid Game,"First I hate not having the option of listening in the original language with English subtitles. No option other than dubbing...my absolute least favorite way to watch. Now, the acting, or rather overacting big time. The main protagonist is an absolute waste of space and acts like Jerry Lewis on acid! The overacting and drivel dialogue makes it a ZERO, but not possible here."
398,Squid Game,Squid is a great show I will not write a long review but you need to watch it.
399,Squid Game,"Absolutely amazing show. The plot is not predictable which I find very intriguing. Kudos to the creators because this show, it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society. Not only does this show keep you hooked, but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole. With all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one I've seen to date. There are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all I highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you. It's much needed perspective growth that more people should delve into."
400,Squid Game,"Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!"
401,Squid Game,"This show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what I think about it, I did so. It isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice. That's what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. Sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. This doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. I don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.For starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. This wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death. It doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was. The characters in game didn't. When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.Also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. They are killed at random. The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. It all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. Losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play. Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. As such it's nothing special in the longrun."
402,Squid Game,I caught this on Netflix and it was a phenomenal series! I wasn't even sure I would like it but I ended up loving it! This is a creative storyline that gets pretty twisted but they were still able to add in some real sentimental parts that were surprising. Also has some mind blowing twists in it. Be prepared episode 6 is a rough one. I couldn't believe how much you end up liking certain characters so when those certain ones were eliminated it gets really upsetting.This ended where they could do another season so I looked it up to see if there were plans for it but there isn't yet. I read the director actually wrote every episode himself on top of directing it. He said if he does do another season he would use a writers table asks other seasoned directors.Do not miss out on this series!
403,Squid Game,"It's been done - and it's been done in better ways. See The Running Man, or Escape from LA. This is teenage waffle trying to appeal to the phone obsessed fickle morals of a younger generation. In that regard it has succeeded.It is essentially a children's programme with the gore not even being that graphic too. Mix that in with a massively predictable and immature plot (the old man was obviously behind it all) and a ""Luke I am your brother"" Star Wars re-hash crossover (complete with Darth Vader type villain) and mix that with a bit of The Hunger Games and you get this.The moral side of it is warped too and the main characters - nay, all of the characters remain very unlikeable, annoying and unrelatable. When he dyed his hair green at the end, I knew this was also trying to appeal to the overly geeky anime teens by attempting to create a cool anti hero that could be replicated at the next comic cons.Overrated."
404,Squid Game,"Squid Game has a very high body count, and lots of gore to go with it. But even while the blood is spattering, the focus is on the characters, their relationships with each other, and the mysteries they're unraveling. The attention to detail in every aspect of the series elevates it from enjoyable and entertaining to truly exceptional.The sets in the Game are mostly simple, with a childish surreality. Yet also artfully designed for the impact that they have, and exquisitely memorable.Usually when the acting is good, we don't notice or think about it. But there were several times that actors displayed their emotions which such perfectly controlled subtlety that you have to stop to admire it: the uncontrollably trembling chin of an actor pushing himself to the edge of tears to do honor to the scene, or an actor's blank face with the character's emotions ""betrayed"" by only the twitching of one eye.Needless to say, the directing and production must have also been top-notch to create these scenes and put them together to tell such a simple but compelling story. The emotional impact is also carefully crafted: somehow, in the midst a huge number of violent deaths, the audience is left sobbing for half of an episode as both developed and undeveloped characters face impending death.And ultimately, there is a fairly clear moral to the story. But that will have more impact if it's seen and felt, instead of described here."
405,Squid Game,One of the best shows I've watched! Everyone of the actors was so so good.
406,Squid Game,"I have to hand it to the Koreans, the two things I've seen from there both had very similar dark themes - the other being ""I Saw the Devil"". Both of which are truly disturbing pieces of art, but you can't help but keep watching to see what the conclusion may be.The show raises some interesting questions about human nature and what drives us to do the awful things we do to one another, and you can't help but wonder if such a shadowy society producing a game like this for wealthy clients really does exist somewhere. Either way, it's a very clever concept and masterfully done.I do hear that the subtitles to English are not always accurate but I don't speak Korean so cannot comment on that. Even if they're not, I was able to follow along and I'm hoping I didn't miss too much of the plot."
407,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a thrilling, emotional and absorbing South Korean drama / thriller series. The series is filled with superb performances, fantastic production values and sets, riveting games and personal storylines. It gets a strong recommendation from me. If you can handle it."
408,Squid Game,Sangh wu offered and showed compassion when he didn't had to(HELPING ALI) and He played him when he had to.SETU.
409,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a Death Game Series, It's Looking Familiar be like Alice in Borderland, Actor & Atress is Very Good, Music is Amazing, My Favorite Round is Red Light, Green Light & The Man with the Umbrella, And The Series has Most Viral on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter & Youtube. The Series, I Giving 10 Star, I LOVE IT!Rating: 10/10."
410,Squid Game,"Sure, it's pretty predictable at times, but the execution (no pun intended) is excellent. What makes Squid Game so good is it's characters and how they try to manage themselves. The subplot of the cop, I could've done without. It was just filler."
411,Squid Game,"Sorry folks, this is not good. I don't know why there is so many great reviews. The main guy is an idiot and loser and not likable at all. But that is not the bad part. Why would you participate in something you have no idea what it is? They will offer you lots of money if you win? You don't think it could be dangerous? No one asked this? All other game shows that you can win money and prizes, don't drug you and have masked people. The first game was so stupid. Every single person moved at red light. Ever so slightly, but they still moved. And only some got shot? And all those people still ran after they saw guys get shot when they moved? Are they all idiots? And green light and red light switched on time, but when all those people got shot, it stayed red for awhile. Why? Really stupid. Also you know you can die so why continue playing. They never mentioned that you can't quit in the first episode. I would say f this I'm out after the first game."
412,Squid Game,"I did not expect it to be so good! This series shows the depths of human behavior, reminded me for a moment Black Mirror.Just watch and you won't regret it. I'm becoming a fan of Korean movies and series. They know how to do the job.Wonderful script, Intriguing,funny, touching and frightening All at once."
413,Squid Game,"If you can deal with the graphic violence you'll enjoy a well acted, well directed mini masterpiece about the human psyche, desperation, relationships, greed, selfishness and sacrifice. Refreshing to watch after all the predictable dross out there. Just about long enough too. Recommended."
414,Squid Game,"I was very surprised by the quality of the storytelling. This story is like a parable, like Greek mythology, a simple story with a message, to make a point that life is not fair. We are not all equal, luck plays a big part in our successes and failures, and ultimately we are in a state of stupor going about our daily rituals, seeking something we don't have, driven by greed which in turn is driven by the desire to have fun and escape boredom, and some of us will do anything if we are given permission to do it and are rewarded for it. This story of humanity is universal, and can be told in a million different ways. The Squid game tells this story in its own way.I think people are horrified at what humans can do to another person, but history has shown us that time and time again, most people are capable of the most awful things if they are scared, alone, are at one point powerless, and then at another point, given power and rewards. It takes a very special person to rise above this. Very special indeed. And if you think you are that person, you are most likely mistaken. This is why the ending of this series is so unpredictable, because out of the ashes, from the depths of despair, can arise a person who is not compelled to be bound by the arbitrary rules set by the powerful, someone who makes all the difference to others, who can see the truth, at last. It is no accident therefore that the writers have juxtaposed religion here and there and 'Jesus?' is asked at the right moment. Very clever in all respects. Thank you to all involved."
415,Squid Game,"I tried to give it a watch I heard nothing but excitement over this show so I decided to see what the fuss is all about and I don't understand. I couldn't even make it 20 minutes into this mess. Robbing old ladies, gambling problems. And blood fetish from the mafia? Insanely boring I couldn't even keep my attention up enough for them to get to playing the ""games"" I heard they do in this show. Disappointing."
416,Squid Game,"...Korean, Chinese and Japanese.Dear Hollywood...R. I. P."
417,Squid Game,When I first started Squid Game I didn't expect much. Just something to pass time at work. After the first two episodes I was hooked. The show is thrilling and makes your heart beat increase. I highly recommend watching if you are looking to have some entertainment for a couple hours.
418,Squid Game,"Some of South Korea's most popular and innocent children's games from the 1970s and 1980s are reinvented as a mysterious survival game with a cash prize of 45.6 billion won for the winner. However, there is a catch: ""Losers must pay with their lives!""My Thoughts:
It's been about two days since I finished Squid Game, and it hasn't left my mind. I still can't believe I finished all nine episodes in one sitting.The acting is beyond phenomenal, and it elicited emotions in me that I had never felt before in any other show. EVERYTHING about the production value, the plot, the character development, the set designs, was simply amazing. I went into this show expecting to mostly enjoy it and then move on, but I had no idea it would have such an impact on me.Squid Game amazingly combines the carefree, idyllic days of childhood with the harsh realities of adulthood by forcing ordinary people to compete in life or deathmatches to potentially wipe out their debts. It's a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer that's equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing. In other words, there is something for everyone in this show. It's emotional, dramatic, with enough blood scenes to satisfy suspense and thrill-seekers.In a nutshell, according to me, the current buzz surrounding Squid Game is well-deserved. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. This is one of my favorites on Netflix right now."
419,Squid Game,"This Korean drama shows up Hollywood in every way. By the third episode, the viewer is totally immersed in the characters' struggles, because this is just good writing. Each character is more and less than they appear to be. We have fascinating and necessary back stories, which make the action incredibly poignant. This is not, as many critics have claimed, a gory show. It's no more violent than something like Game of Thrones. Less so, as the main violence is people being dispatched by gunfire. I do think the last few episodes weren't as good as the first ones, but I suspect they're planning a follow-up season, so much was left unexplained. Great show that really explores human nature, both the good and the bad."
420,Squid Game,"The plot is exciting.. keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat.. but the ending is so rushed and not so great.. the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players .. then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene.. they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax..in the earlier part it's kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to Gi Hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him.. I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending."
421,Squid Game,"Not in the same league as a lot of korean stuff,its a steady series thats about it,most of the caracters in it are as dumb and thick as dogs💩,and it dose'nt take no working out whats going to happen at the end."
422,Squid Game,After money heist its next amazing bog thing on netflix ..from above it looks like only thriller but actually its a fulll package u need to must watch ...foled with emothoon and every thing that one wants in the show.
423,Squid Game,"Rating: 8This show was identical to Money Heist in so many ways. The costumes, the plot, the way how people tackle situations and obviously Netflix. Squid Game seems like Money Heist of an alternate darker reality. But I enjoyed it. I hope the series does not get milked much. The acting performances were good, I liked how the games were simple yet ingenious.This series, I believe took heavy influence from old movies like Cube and Exam. Exam is a really underrated flick and I could sense the influence in the finale.I believe you can give it a watch and climb the hype train. It has comedy, gore, tragedy etc a complete package but it's not a must watch. I think it will get renewed for a Season 2 but after the finale something felt amiss hence I am giving it an 8. Probably because I have seen Money Heist, Exam, Cube, Saw etc hence I didn't find the plot as completely new and offbeat."
424,Squid Game,"I recall a book from the very early 80's, 'The Ludi Victor' by James Leigh, which is pretty much the same idea repackaged here. Squid Game is quite well done. No real surprises, even the person behind it all wasn't too difficult to guess once you connected some of the dots. In an endless sea of bland series though this does stand out so it's worth the watch."
425,Squid Game,"I remember watching Korean films back in the day and they had .. something. These days it seems they copy American style with a bit of a twist, but still disappointing.In episode 4, they make a huge plot mistake which makes no sense (food, without spoiling too much).This show is like news media... using something to shock you, to get you to watch, but no quality or depth to it."
426,Squid Game,"So Initially I liked this.Than in the last couple of episodes everything was ruined.It sort of forgets what the main character wants to become.So the game has been running for decades. Yet it was sponsored by a man who died in the last episode???How does that work?I am sure some of the translations where not correct.The shaky English by the V. I. P. S sort of make that obvious. The V. I. P. S have to be the worst actors I have seen in a Korean show. I can't believe those people even have resumes and all experience as writers.... Can't they tell them to get other talent. Why did the majority of them have to be Westerners as well ???So after this was ruined. I looked back. And thought about what I liked.And I have to admit I was blinded by some of the decors and the art direction.There is too much that doesn't make sense , like the side operation run by some of the employeesSo the minimum I can give is 1 star when I rate a title.I gave it two stars because I liked the acting of the character Sae Byeok by Hoyeon Jung. As well as the other girl she paired up with in episode 5 and 6.I decided not to give a star for the art direction as their were some obvious fails to that as well. But I don't think the art department can be held responsible for that.They did have the best lines and writing as well.Really this is not worth your time as well.... just watch battle royale or tag.The shooting of this might have been a lot of fun. That is why it sort of is funny that the sick organisor says it is more fun if you participate instead of watching . Well I think this holds true for this show."
427,Squid Game,"There's nothing new here. And it's not better than any of the many other films, programmes, or books out there on the very same topic. In fact, I completely fail to see the appeal as well as the point.It's not a bad show, and if you haven't seen any other films or programmes about people being pawns in (generally) wealthy people's sick and murderous games, it might be enjoyable."
428,Squid Game,"Very gorey, love that. The plot was predictable most of the time, and the ending was so unsatisfactory. They'll prolly show what happens next in season 2, but honestly ever since number 067 died, it hasn't been the same. I was rooting for her so hard, even tho I knew she wouldn't win in the end.Also, I've a feeling the officer didn't die, he was shot in the SHOULDER by his BROTHER. Lol that's just my theory. I've a feeling the officer will come back in S2 and save the front man, cause the front man is prolly mixed up in this and can't leave."
429,Squid Game,"I thought I cried during the hunger games, yeah no. This was more than I could've ever imagined. Very eye opening to what our world can and could be like. Very happy they released this when they did, this show is phenomenal."
430,Squid Game,"The thing is, for me at least, I had to ""forgive"" much of the script, there are big plot holes in the series that one has to just overlook to make it to the end and give it such high ratings.Don't get me wrong, I get this is not supposed to be taken literally, and some suspension of disbelief is necessary for most syfy series, but you have to be consistent with your own premise.(Side note, sorry if there're mistakes/misspellings, somethings up with my app it seems.)"
431,Squid Game,"Spoiler !All deasthes can be predicted in orderSpoiler !One of the most predictable thing which can be named was the ""OLDMAN"" key role in the game, from the scene of ""Night Chaos"" that he shouted ""Stop"" and the ""Black Man"" obeyed his order."
432,Squid Game,"This is a good show; the concept is good, the acting from the main cast is solid, it deserves to be watched by the masses.But; it's not a great show... it has some plot holes, as well as some terrible acting by the American characters (I won't include any spoilers, but I guarantee you'll know what I mean)All I've seen these past few weeks is the serious hype surrounding the show, and as someone who is a bit of a film buff, it needed an honest review. Go watch it, you'll enjoy it, but please don't claim it as the best show ever."
433,Squid Game,"This is a must watch. It speaks for itself. It's violent yes, but the characters are alive with plenty of personality. Pure quality. Perfect storyboarding and addictive. Yes, the weakest part is the WIPs but the rest is perfect."
434,Squid Game,An excellent modern fable that strongly resonates with the debt crisis (specially in South Korea). It is more of a psychological commentary about human behavior in life/death situations.
435,Squid Game,"#SquidGame, I believe each & every game, each & every episode was almost perfect! I believe I never felt any boring scene throughout the series despite 1 hour long 9 episodes. Every game is edge of the seat moment, the way director created emotions at the end of marbals game that was Outstanding. That old man & Ali was phenomenal. The lead 3 character were fantastic throughout the series! Only VIP's acting wasn't good as needed but it doesn't create any effect on the series! A Definitely must watch series!"
436,Squid Game,"This series show us how can be tricky to be poor but paying with the life is not a good end to the problems.This kinda violates human rights in some ways that are impossible to describe but the end of the series make it worth watch.Carefull with the games you play , guns are not the end of all lives sentence."
437,Squid Game,"From all the Netflix shows that theyre taking over the world by storm Squid game is my favourite. The story is very interesting, the actors are incredible and the drama is perfect. Episode 6 is the best emotional episode that i've seen this year but then is falls down with the cringe VIPs and the twist at the end kind'a takes the emotions that you felt at the end of ep 6. Althought a good series and looking foorward too season 2!!"
438,Squid Game,I watched this because everyone else already had. And it was supposed to be ground breaking.It is far too long. I was just sitting there waiting for the next game to begin. Would have been better as a movie. The bad ending didn't help.I had to resist the urge a couple of times to fast-forward to the last episode. How it became so popular I have no idea. But it was alright.
439,Squid Game,"Thoroughly enjoyed this show, waaaay out there, but so out there it was truly captivating!"
440,Squid Game,"Overhyped nonsense with a typical K Drama thrown in for good measure.The story is a carbon copy of several other Netflix shows, including a Japanese tv show from a few years back
The acting is way overexaggerated and borderline cheesy
The setup is completely nonsensical and the atmosphere in the film, except for a few moments, is poorly done.The only reason this show got the exposure it got is because of the enormous amount of marketing it received from Korean conglomerates. This was advertised on every bus and taxi in Seoul for months.If you're going to be copying a typical battle royale formula, at least make it original."
441,Squid Game,"The shows interesting, it's entertaining, but the main character is such an idiot I wish he would have died right away."
442,Squid Game,"Simply Genius... A masterpiece... Its a must watch webseries.... Grt performance by each and every character...
Waiting for season 02.. korean webseries are never disappoints.."
443,Squid Game,If you are looking for a happy ending look elsewhere. The ending was meeeeeh but just give it a try. Great acting here.
444,Squid Game,"I have to agree with others: I really didn't like the last three episodes and the wrap-up was dissatisfying. ""Gganbu"" was one of the strongest episodes in an emotional perspective, yet the last episodes tracked back with the reveal of the ""one"" behind everything on one of the most interesting relationships they set up through the entirety of the show.They also left one of the most interesting characters who had so much potential completely behind, Sae-byeok, and completely invalidated the sacrifice of Ji-yeong and the impact of their scene - which was a shame.The VIP's were stereotypes, horrible actors, and extremely unnecessary. I hated every second on screen they appeared and their absolutely dumb commentary.Up until Episode 7, I would have given it a 9 or 10. Episode 7 onwards was a 4 for me. 10+4 / 2 = 7 stars overall."
445,Squid Game,I particularly like the way the characters are built and their stories are shown to the viewer and how their life is desperate to the point they put it in risk to make it better.
446,Squid Game,"Koreans now to the Emmy awards. Great, surprising.But ending is disappointing. Maybe It's because of there's another season .."
447,Squid Game,"I agree with others about the VIPs acting and line being awful. I watched it dubbed in English, so it could be translation, or voice acting that went awry. Otherwise the dub was quite good(well for dub standards). I think I'll be watching it a second time with just subtitles.South Korean cinema has become so popular in the West because it carries a certain gravitas and detail many western movies lack these days. I'm far from a film buff who looks forward to Tribeca or Sundance, but I can confidently say there is a distinct discipline displayed in South Korean films and shows. From the emotions on display by talented actors, to scripts that rely more on showing over telling, to the amazing seeds sown early that lead to payoffs later. And it's all wrapped up in great cinematography.Squid Game is no different. It might not reach the heights of OldBoy or Parasite or even I saw the Devil, and is a little more predictable. But it is a must watch for fans of South Korean films."
448,Squid Game,"This Korean series is a poor, lame adaptation and actualization into a bloody pop Korean culture context, of a short story (""El premio"", The prize) by Julio Cortázar. Only in a iliterate culture such as actual you can explain why people became fans of such a lame tv series. If you hace read Cortázar's shor5t story, you will know immediatlñy that that's the major spoiler you can recieve from this schow."
449,Squid Game,"It is disturbing in a way that why the hell is happening this ?But I have to say that the plot is unique ( Not in a good way or bad way but very dark grey i guess ).Okay, At last my opinion is one should watch this."
450,Squid Game,"Terrible VIPs and second to last episode was trash, but in whole it's great, recommend to watch."
451,Squid Game,"I didn't like the final episode that much. Way too much mellow drama for my personal taste. I would have preferred if more then one character survived, those characters being Seoul Gihun, Kang Sae, Sang Woo, and Jang. I really didn't like how Jang went out.Overall a good intense show."
452,Squid Game,"Everything is predictable and nothing surprising happened about who survived the game and what happened at the end...the games had nothing like intelligent mind game, they are just a bunch of gambles plus trial of muscle strength which is completely a disadvantage for women. The masterminds, the fellows, rich vips, people who showed up in business scene etc are all male, also there were full of misogyny and insulting lines to women which supposedly old stereo type stupid males came up with. As a person who lives in an asian country near korea, there's no wonder. Those elements were just disgusting and there was nothing fun to watch this show. I just kept watching it expecting something mindblowing would happen at the end by high scored reviews but NO nothing at all. I just waisted my time."
453,Squid Game,It's definitely not usual korean drama. It doesn't have any romance or any thing. So any one even who don't like korean drama can enjoy it.If you like escape room or Alice in boarderland it is definitely your kind of series. Story is simple a group of people play children's games and who loses will die. Even it is children's games it will keep you at the edge. That's also the speciality of the series.This series will never going to disappoint you It's worth every bit of your time.
454,Squid Game,"I love squid game. I watched all 9 episodes in 2 days as it was so intriguing. Episode 6,9 and 1 were so good and the games were so tense and creative such as the first one and the tug of war won. Episode 6 was really sad with many of my favourites dying like Ali and il nam. The twist at the end of ep 9 was good with IL name creating the games but I didn't like it that much. There are some unnecessary rude scenes in ep 4 and 7 but I just forwarded them.Overall,I rate the show 8.5.It was definitely Netflix's best show but it was not the greatest show of all time."
455,Squid Game,"Other says Alice in Borderland has much intensity especially in episode 3 . But squidgame, it has a heart, loyalty . It's a mix of As God's Will, Triangle (2011) that ship scene."
456,Squid Game,"What a unique, entertainingly disturbing concept. The writing was well done and kept the watchers guessing with lots of twist and turns. You feel for individual characters struggling to survive that many people can relent too. The games are simple yet disturbingly twisted which keeps
You wanting to see what comes next. Two thumbs up!!"
457,Squid Game,"Being a fan of Korean cinema I was intrigued by this series and over the weekend became addicted to each episode. I was especially intrigued as I know Jung Ho-Yeon from the fashion industry and worked with her on many fashion shows. Didn't know she could act as well as she did and look as unattractive that her role called for. The only but for me was the VIPS and the manner in which they were portrayed. It was vulgar, crude and racist and a total turn off for me."
458,Squid Game,Didn't like the Korean overacting or the premise or the pacing. Got 2/3rds of the way through Ep1 and gave up. Can't see what all the fuss is about and I normally give stuff like this a chance.
459,Squid Game,It started off slow but picked up and starts to catch your attention Quick after the plot is revealed...the Characters are interesting and by the middle of the show your already explained of most of their roles. Definitely something different from most recent series.
460,Squid Game,First few episodes were good.but than those vips kind of ruined it......hate to break it. .but how somebody can enjoy it when you are killing people like some tomato bags.
461,Squid Game,"Omg it was amazing! Attractive, interesting and exciting from the first episode! I LOVE IT! I love the whole characters and how they played their roles, it was damn sad when the grandpa have died and Sae-Byeok at the end."
462,Squid Game,"The Old Man being the main guy - hmm...
There are hints throughout the show btw. In the Green Light, Red Light he was the one who just triumphantly walked among the people trembling with fear after the ""K-Anabelle(lol)"" doll starts shooting.He smiles as he is enjoying the moment. But they wouldn't kill him because as we saw he wouldn't be killed after the Marbles Game, he still lives.So, maybe there was no stake for him, I guess or maybe there was... that's why he volunteered to play. Or maybe just for fun of it, you know - as he says.Even in marbles episode, he is shown as a planner to trick 456 just to see if he tries to use the 'dementia' of an 'helpless' old man, even if he is considered a good friend. But he went out as a kind, loving grandpa kind of way. That's why the twist - that he was the Mastermind bums most people. But he is a planner, a great one. I am not judging if he is a smart guy, should be an evil one. Just saying after the series shows he was.Just take this as a fun read, I guess. Umm, bye."
463,Squid Game,"Last century misogyny, foul language, ageism, casual racism, greed and despair - basically everything that's wrong with South Korea today, and which would be outright rejected if this was a Hollywood/Western production. It's amazing how a few bits of cheap brightly coloured scenery and silly costumes can get people excited about what is a very old and trite concept. Yawn."
464,Squid Game,"A series high on adrenalin and suspence. With a very relatable lead. I loved the scenes. The lead does not feel untouchable, rather, you get the sence that he two may fall at any time. The plot is simple yet loveable.You actually understand why the characters are willing to go through what they endured based on their own personal struggles. It is a sad and emotional flick.Pay attention to the Subtitled even when watching the Dubbed version. It is full of nuggets ands gems.A masterclass that may have initiated me into a new genre."
465,Squid Game,"Very very minor spoiler. The show as a whole was phenomenal, and I'd recommend it to almost anyone, but the ending was weak. The second half of the last episode honestly weakened my rating by two full stars. Still worth it though."
466,Squid Game,"So misanthropic, violent, gory, pessimistic, vague, misleading and superficial... but its production was very good and in good taste.Maybe that's just what most people care about and this is the reason that it has an 8 rating on IMDb!Don't let your children watch this also!Politically it was so vague and maybe it can give some people very wrong ideas about authoritarian systems and regimes.Don't forget about the whole series just because it has a decent humanistic ending!On most occasions, there wasn't any humanistic approach at all.There was something more like amnesia, players keep forgot that they have to kill everyone to be able to go out, just unbelievable.Casting of all non-Korean actors for VIPs were completely scornful and wrong and the actors who played the VIPs were sounding so amateur and unnatural.There was some good stuff and some good intentions in this TV mini-series but it was buried under these negative aspects of it.6.3/10."
467,Squid Game,I really don't get the hype. Done 5 episodes now and find it all rather boring.Maybe I was expecting too much when someone told me it similar to Battle Royale....?
468,Squid Game,"This is a very strange series. It's like a cross between Logan's Run, The Hunger Games, Lost, Lord of the Flies (not to mention M. C. Escher) and a number of other dystopian books/movies that have come out over time. I grant that the way the story is told is somewhat original, and as an example of Korean drama, I suppose it gets a few points for raising that profile....But seriously...WTF!!!!!The dialogue, is addition to being almost juvenile at times, is made even more excruciating by the absolutely horrible, over the top, beyond melodramatic delivery by both the original Korean actors and the those doing the English dub. But even the scenes in English (the VIPS) was ridiculous, so while this may be intended and a normal quality of Korean cinema, it doesn't automatically make it good or even ok. My score of 3 is almost exclusively due to this. It made the show nearly unwatchable. Maybe this makes more sense in the original Korean and would have been better served by English subtitles. I don't know.I also question the premise for the show in the first place. Yeah, times are tough, but would people really be that morally depraved? After the first round when they were allowed to leave, I find it difficult to believe that anyone would come back no matter how difficult their situation was on the outside. And how could anyone ever possibly emotionally separate their ""winnings"" from how they were acquired? And while the ""1 year later"" epilogue does cover this to some extent, I mean really, what kind of horrible, sad, miserable life is Gi-hun going to have? Obviously they're planning a second season, so maybe we'll find out more, but I don't think I really care .Also, as we learn more about the operation of the contest itself, more questions arise. First you wonder how they explain all the deaths. Then when you realize they are harvesting organs, you have to ask why a sudden influx of supposedly anonymous organ donations wouldn't be questioned by someone. And wouldn't there be a sudden flurry of missing persons reported that the authorities would be looking into? I get it. It's a fantasy dystopian thing, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief on this point.However, I liked the creepy use of Tchaikowsky's waltz from ""Serenade for Strings"", Strauss's ""Blue Danube"" and ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and found it to be one of the more interesting aspects.But again, seriously......WTF!!!P. S. How again is the game court supposed to look like a squid?"
469,Squid Game,"Annoying characters, illogical events, boring dialogues, very precictable. What was this all about? That Koreans like violence and satanic killing? The idea is the series is quite good but the script is eventually pretty weak."
470,Squid Game,"Make sure watch it
its amazingif u wana more excellent korean series?I offer u thisflower of evil
my dangrus wife
goblin
& hotel deluna."
471,Squid Game,This TV show was very sad in the beginning but as it goes on it get good the story is very well written and I got to warn you its very graphic I give this show a thumbs up make that 4.
472,Squid Game,"OK: I've only seen the first episode, but what a drivel it is! As if this would ever happen in real life. It also - forever - lowers my faith in both Japan as a refined culture and people in general who praise this a-b-s-o-l-u-t-e tripe.Why even make this kind of TV-series when it only focuses on how much blood people can bleed? Please avoid at all costs."
473,Squid Game,"What is wrong with the world? Lol this show is horrible and predictable but mostly stupid.Episode 2, they all go home... those that survived. Then they go back, willingly and I'm supposed to feel sorry for them? Oh, my they are so broke that they'll go enter games to kill themselves for money that if they die they don't get so they leave their family without answers to even where they've gone. Now their family will spend a lifetime looking for them.That's selfish.I think people today are easily entertained. The thought of being so stupid so play chilhood games in a deadly way for money is insane. Oh and it was obvious #1 was in on it... he was far too happy playing a Red Light and definitely moved lol.I'm in awe, seriously."
474,Squid Game,"Despite the moody grim nature of the show it manages to pull off great thrills, human drama and most importantly hope and an ending that satisfies giving hope to its viewers. It doesn't try to be ultra realistic or end on a depressing grim note which is why I loved this show!!!"
475,Squid Game,"Its no doubt this series is great.. But is it worth all the hype it's getting across the world?! No...The concept looks similar to modified concepts from several movies that we might have seem before.. like hunger games, battle royal, the condemned, the running man and many more..While the games itself were okayish to watch, the show is not about the games.. Its more about the relationship between players.. Ots all about the emotional connect.. Overall, its a good unreasonably overhyped series.."
476,Squid Game,"Standard down on their luck beginning of characters, then the storyline quickly goes into overdrive with many social mores broken.I guessed the ending but the reason I don't give this 10/10 is the last episode is somewhat muddled. The angst and actions of the main character is weakly explained."
477,Squid Game,"First six episodes are great - excellent introduction of characters and how they got here, careful world-building, clever and shocking games with increasing suspense up to episode 6 which is the peak of the showBy episode 7 there are about 20 players left, with a couple of ""important"" characters. That's where the show goes downhill:the fifth game is almost entirely luck based and running order practically determines who will pass. It also weeds out a lot of players giving us finalists out of nowhere-the winner is predictable and almost all uncertainties are removed prior to the final game, that confrontation felt empty
VIPS are abomination and ruin these last 3 episodes by a lotThe cop - lost brother plot resolved in a very underwhelming wayFront man is still a mystery - how he got to that position and why, his only redeeming quality is cool maskThe host and the grand scheme are also very underwhelming and predictablethe 1 year later epilogue is just depressing, maybe that was the intentionAll in all, I feel it could've been better. It's like they've run out of ideas towards the end."
478,Squid Game,"The series uses recurring theme of anime like jujutsu kaisen, btooom and movie like Tournament, Gun Akimbo; tries to put together set of events which are predictable and characters which you cannot relate to. And to make that happen there is very stupid premise of VIPs and debt for which people are ready to kill and die for."
479,Squid Game,"I wasn't hoping it to be this good but it has a good story, good graphics and well acted. Teaches a few life lessons. Sometimes the story gets slow but picks up later on. A great watch indeed."
480,Squid Game,"The premise and aesthetic of the show had me hooked already. Lots of mystery. Love-able and hate-able characters. The ""games"" they play are always intense and you hope your favourites survive.It was quite emotional too, there's times where you have to be deceitful to your allies.Really great show all round. Although the VIP's had atrocious acting when they were introduced around EP 7. Really took me out the immersion for an episode.Other than that it was amazing, I love Korean shows and you don't get many on Netflix, so I hope the show does well so we see more.TL;DRIt's great, watch it."
481,Squid Game,"The messages of this series were too negative. The topics have been done before, but this series shows worse versions of the topics.Nearly everything was predictable. Stupid decisions are made. Don't understand what all the hype was about. Won't be watching the second season. If any."
482,Squid Game,"Sorry. That's a crude summation of this brilliant series. It's a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in. Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game.Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out. The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed. It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror. If you're ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game."
483,Squid Game,"I am seldom one to follow the masses and I am not probe to popular opinion. At first I was of two minds, but as the story develops it becomes more complex. The characters who seem likable and reasonable becomes more questionable. You become torn between their motivation and which is the real driver - survival or greed. Or are they possibly the same? In a world where ownership is survival what defines a fair game? If there is such a thing anymore... This is very good storytelling even if a bit extreme. The lines between good and bad gets blurred. The walls between ethical and immoral is broken down. The subtext is phenomenal and though the violence feels somewhat unnecessary (it could have been done less graphical), it is driven by very strong narrative threads. Highly recommended! This is Money Heist, but with an actual story."
484,Squid Game,Life is boring when you are a billionaire. Gripping with anxiety but futile and aimless if you poor. One gets excitement the other gets money and aim. Where is all to lead? Have a look.
485,Squid Game,"A series or movie that makes time pass quickly because you're so into it is greatly appreciated by me. So many titles to choose from but only a few leave you with a feeling of satisfaction after viewing. Several Korean series hit that mark, Vagabond, Kingdom, Tunnel, to name a few. The only problem I have is with scenes that go on way to long, Nine episodes could've been cut to six with some efficient editing but other than that I loved it."
486,Squid Game,Every episode they took morea than anything efforts to make such a great show. I love this show and all the characters made this show a very well. Congratulations to all the cast and crew for working for this series. Loved it and i can watch it again and again.
487,Squid Game,"I don't know how to feel about this series, it left me with so many feelings. I have to say that I liked it for that reason. I was very uncomfortable watching the show, but something kept me watching. There were some plot holes that other people have mentioned already. I also think that some of the gruesomeness was a bit unnecessary. I understand that the gore was a big part in the whole show, but some of the scenes were a little too much. Otherwise, definitely worth a watch."
488,Squid Game,"Very good tv show as i expected from the Korean shows but i think the storytelling is not very well although the characters are well written
And i liked the Design and Music also some twist events."
489,Squid Game,"What i really liked about this is its completely different to all the other formulaic shows, i watch a lot of tv and even if i am watching something i am really enjoying i often feel i have seen it before. This is completely unique. Totally absorbing on the edge of your seat television."
490,Squid Game,"An absolute masterpiece of tv show
The actors the story the cast, music, just all is prefect, enjoyed every minute of it."
491,Squid Game,"The survival story is actually pretty good, but it doesn't really surprise me in a way like how a thriller should be able to suprise you. Honestly, I must admit that is too overrated since there are still tons of movies/series with better quality. To me, the story is not that tense and plot twist is also very average for a survival story.However, what I like the most is the emotional effects that you usually find from a K-drama. As a viewer, I am able to understand the characters' backgrounds till they want to sacrifice their life for money. I mean it is very sensible since you can find it in our everydays' life. Obviously, this is a very good point since most survival stories are not that logical and sensible. Well, we can find a lot of life lessons from Squid Game. I think this is one the reasons why it is too overrated despite the average plot twists.On top of that, I really love the 'A Class' actors as the cameos, it's quite surprising though I wish they could involve more. I think instead of the main casts, Gong Yoo is the main trigger why people are so curious to watch it. In other words, A Class cameos are the stars there. Well, I really hope they will bring back Gong Yoo and Lee Byun Hun later on!"
492,Squid Game,"In my opinion, ""Squid Game"" is overhyped, and I don't see any other reason than good marketing and viral advertisement.The story is nothing new: game, where the last survivor(s) get(s) the prize. We had seen it in anime, tv-shows, and movies like ""Cube"". Nothing special. What Squid Game does different? Actually, not much. It discloses the motivation of the characters, which is, eventually, irrelevant. It allows to fill half of a season instead of filming 1.5 hour movies.Do I think it's a bad show? No, it's decent and I don't regret watching it. Yet it's quite basic in every possible respect, distinguished by quality of the scenes, but not content.."
493,Squid Game,"Ok first and foremost hear me out, it's Jigsaw but made in a larger environment, with bigger budget and more techy stuff, with same poorly executed and barely noticeable subtle society criticism. Is it watchable? Yes it is. Is it ground breaking, revolutionary, never seen before kind of story that people will remember and passionately talk about even 10 years from now; like the overhype wants you to believe? Absolutely not. Acting is probably the worst part of this show, characters are hard to believe and sympathize with with almost no character development, the way you see them in the first episode is the way they stay for the rest of it... All in all, for people who for some reason tend to fetishize Korean production and for people who want to be up to date with what TikTok is talking about this is a must watch, for everyone else watch if you want but even if you skip it you're not missing anything."
494,Squid Game,"..... ruined by some extremely unlikeable characters, and some really terrible voice acting. It's visually stunning, though, with several impressive sets."
495,Squid Game,"Firsts things first, the series is really well made and has a very well thought and written story.Speaking of story, this one was super realistic in regards to what would happen if such a situation were to happen, the only 2 problems I had were thinking of a way someone could be that rich to afford such facilities and to buy a island for themselves while keeping everything unsuspicious. Talking about unsuspicious, problem number 2 is how would 456 be kidnapped and no one would notice? Other than that I have no other critic to the story, well done, realistic and interesting.Image wise it is as impressive as a series gets. The sceneries are beautifully well made. Interesting camera angles for a series as well.Lastly I want to point something out, a technicality that I noticed (and like I noticed this one I might have missed many others or there might not even exist any other, I don't know). When they are at the Tug of War, when a team loses they all fall down the bridge. I also noticed that it takes a few seconds for the blade to cut the rope. If putted the pieces together then shouldn't the winning team fall down the bridge as well duo to the massive weight difference, especially when it's a team with 3 women vs one full of men and the team with the women wins (meaning the team with only men is heavier)?To finish, the series is not perfect but it is pretty damn high up there."
496,Squid Game,"It could have been great - human selfishness exposed through worst excesses of capitalism, emotional struggles and ridiculously tough life and death choices, great sets, plenty of villains and drama.Instead, it is so unbelievably full of plot holes that it could only work as a parody, perhaps even really well. Unfortunately, Squid Game takes itself more seriously than a 19th century psychiatrist. It oozes heaviness and deep philosophy that its clownishly overacting cast (VIPs are the least of the show's problems) just cannot bear out."
497,Squid Game,"My ears rang, the never-ending drone of people clamoring on about a new television show, one that raised their expectations of Korean cinema and the content Netflix sponsors. I ignored it for a while, but the incessant noise could only be filtered out for so long - eventually I gave in. The faint tap of the buttons on my Google TV remote echoed through my living room, the silence almost deafening. I sat there for a while, looking at the cover - what did it all mean? I knew, of course, there was only one way to find out - I had to watch it. I had to steel myself; bend my legs, jump on the bandwagon. For a few moments I sat puzzled, wondering why I couldn't grasp the context; my brain was moving at a million miles per hour and skipped over something integral to my understanding of the media - subtitles. The echoes of the remote could be heard again as I navigated the maze of menus to provide me with context to this global phenomenon, something I had managed to avoid for as long as I could.As I sit there, the darkness almost entirely enveloping me (save for the incredible illumination of the 55"" screen on the wall), I began to sink. I sank further and further, my sense of awareness gently escaping my grasp. 001. 199. 218. 456. The numbers revolved around me, my attention skittering between them. Who do I pine for? Who do I despise? Who do I pity? Who do I envy? Even though my mind raced through these questions, it could never find an answer. No, it could never perform any task in its entirety as it was completely and utterly hypnotized by the reel of cinema rolling before my eyes.Eventually, I came to. I looked at my clock: 3:53 AM. How much time had passed since I sat down? I couldn't remember. I picked up my phone and a steady stream of notifications littered my lock screen. I asked myself a different question - how many DAYS had passed? I had been so engrossed in this work of art I lost all sense of being, all sense of time, all sense of life. And yet, I never felt like I missed something, like I had passed on experiences that would have made me feel some semblance of happiness and joy. My life had skipped two days in the blink of an eye and I didn't feel anything. And despite watching the illegible names of several people I knew nothing about in Hangul gently scroll up, I still continued to think about the event I had just witnessed. What happens next? At the moment, I don't know (though, my mind certainly has ideas). But I can only hope that this phenomenon continues, as my mind couldn't take the hit of knowing this would be the only exposure to something so interesting, something so vile yet gripping.So I say to you - stop reading this convoluted memoir and watch it. You eyes may bleed; your mind may shatter - but you will never feel something as incredible as this piece of television."
498,Squid Game,"Intense. Massively intense!!!Games. Choices. Money. Decision.Oh what a twist! Salute to the Scriptwriter and Director, Hwang Dong-hyuk!Cheers to all the actors! It made me scream and cry!9.5/10#SquidGame."
499,Squid Game,"It would be completely unfair to rate the actors if you watch English dub, because a lot is lost in translation. This is the best drama series available. I."
500,Squid Game,Squid Game is a solid show but that's it. I don't know why there is such a hype about it. This show is just a few weeks old but already overrated...
501,Squid Game,"With a premise similar to the likes of Cube and Circle, the odd titled Squid Game helps us question humanity all over again as well as the importance society places on money.As dark and violent as Battle Royal and intriguing as 3% it grabs your attention early on and keeps you guessing to the end.Great binge worthy series with a likeable cast and main protagonist.Knocked off one point as I didn't love the ending but otherwise a really great TV series with some great ideas and worthy of top marks.Season 2? Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again..."
502,Squid Game,"This has budget, making for some entertaining scenes, but the plot is quite poor, many parts didn't make sense, too much of it down to luck and it's very predictable. The characters' back stories are uninteresting, there's not much character development. It's average at best for the genre."
503,Squid Game,"Interesting Korean take on Hunger Games and Battle Royale. Good start with intrigue and character building until it became boring, pretentious and predictable cliché."
504,Squid Game,"Take Battle Royale, Alice in Borderland, and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji - put them in a blender with all the best parts of each - BOOM you get Squid Game. Incredible plot, great acting (yea the English VIPs were awful, but not enough to the people who are complaining about them in reviews), and the intensity...wonderful series."
505,Squid Game,"It started good but end up pretentious.There were many things left unexplained like
1- the videos were already sent to police .2- how did the cop's brother become a master and for what .3- there were people who's supposed to take the MC kidney, but somehow and even though he never paid them back ( since he never used the money ) after a year , he still had his kidneys .4- I don't remember how many players were there but how did they manage to split into groups of tens. It doesn't make any sense .5- the cop that was shot, the body will be found and even if it didn't , he would still be remain missing, which is a huge problem since he's a cop not just a citizen.6- when the old man told his assistant to excuse him from watching the game with the vips and wanted to play with the players, the vips only watched the glass game and the old man was expelled earlier so this doesn't make sense eitherI don't know what is it with Korean drama but they always mess it up , they start good but finish badly , the acting the story line , the plot holes .My god every time they show us the English speakers characters , I just want to throw up . The whole scene , the decorations , who the heck thought of that , why ruin it .And I must finish with , if you're gonna watch this , you should watch the movie serie saw instead , it's better anyway , since this was a huge rip off.I wished that the girl would have won .. and that the MC would have ended just as greedy and betrayer as others , it would be a better story line and very unexpected since she was only a side character ."
506,Squid Game,"Deadbeats and losers being used in games that result in death for the entertainment of elite. Brutal, disturbing, and depressing look into human psyche. But good.Also, if you want something along the same lines, check out the anime ""Kaiji"". I believe there is some inspiration from Kaiji although Kaiji is more about gambling games (and is even more entertaining I'd say)."
507,Squid Game,"This serie could be on the top so many years.Variety of games, colors, act, scenes, suspense and even reality, who knows? Jaja.Great 1st episope at the half of it starts the action
2nd one was like... oh no are they gonna leave the games??Later on the games are spot on and the only downside is the end. Although we know for sure it will be 2nd season.Just waiting for that."
508,Squid Game,"I wanted to give this 9/10, as I enjoyed the first 6 episodes immensely. Ok, it's not massively original in its premise, but the South Korean slant and the focus on individual debt made this more than interestingHowever, once the VIP's arrived I felt it lost its way a little and the switch to English was quite jarring (I watched it in subtitles). Whether it was deliberate or not, the ""acting"" and dialogue of the VIP's was pretty poor and riddled with unnecessary exposition and cliche. In addition, I felt the subplot regarding the stowaway policeman wasn't properly resolvedWhilst the finale wasn't terrible - it felt a little disjointed with some characters making decisions that seemed odd based on what they'd done before (Cho Sang-Woo for example in the Squid game). Also, the ""reveal"" in the skyscraper kind of ruined a few of the previous episodes.It's a shame, as this could have been an even better series than it actually was - but it is still definitely worth a watch."
509,Squid Game,"I was hooked into the series right from the start. It has a good plot and getting to know the main character. From there it is a blast. Some people may find it disturbing, but it is a part if the show. You will have to watch it. Only down side is the last episode."
510,Squid Game,"5 episodes in. Can't stand player 070, but boy is this dark. Sick and scary. I can believe this stuff really happens, for sick people's pleasure. A bit like Hostel, Saw and other scary stuff. Eye covering watching."
511,Squid Game,"...Which is saying something for TV today. A lot of reviewers here seem to be getting caught up technical or other sidebar issues w/ the series, all forgetting the simple fact it's a show, complete w/ weak, strong, good and bad moments. But it is most assuredly compelling TV without a doubt and hence my 8 rating. One episode had me in tears, while the 1st episode left a lot to be desired, some were extremely gripping, and certain aspects I could definitely quibble with. But overall, I hung in there throughout and would definitely recommend watching it, as it is compelling TV, and anything but boring! So go for it."
512,Squid Game,"Not only did this hit show break international records like the most watched show of all time, it's actually very entertaining and smart! It is very violent, let's get that right, it's not really made for everyone. But the story is really good and there's a surprisingly good amount of philosophy in this show! How important is money? How important are friends? This show seriously makes you think! Truly amazing! The ending was weak but it doesn't matter. The first 6 episodes are mind-blowing!! 🌟🌟🌟"
513,Squid Game,"Some of it was good, some of it very good, some of it not so good.My frowning moments were:*** spoiler alert **** When they started killing each other, 27 people in total: too soon and over the top. Here I considered giving it 5 stars at most.* The ending during which the bad guy has a sudden change of heart, with no convincing explanation.* The English speaking people were over the top and somehow not very convincing. All except the sexual predator, which did add to the creepiness.* The importance of money made no sense to me; yes, poverty is a nuisance, but to have it turn you into a killing machine? Nor did I understand the 1 winner only system. I don't recall it being specified that only 1 person could leave with the money (could've been made more clear in fact as the main character hopes to leave together with a girl). I personally think it would've been better and not damaging to the storyline if more people could've shared the prize merely by making it through all games alive. First of all there was enough money to go around for quite some people. But foremostly because I just don't believe ANYONE except a crazed psychopath would agree to being the single winner, meaning you have to watch everyone (everyone - 500 people!) die. And they chose this voluntarily too, when they came back for that second round. Really, if I handed you a lottery ticket with a 1 in 500 chance of winning but a 500 to 1 chance of killing you, would you take it?* Melodrama on various occasions where less would've been more.* Like others have said that one screaming, scheming female should've been toned down (or replaced by a less annoying actress).* I thought the twist at ending okay but the ending after that somewhat daft. He should have just done what he should've done at the get-go: give a darn about his daughter.* The character developement of the main character was poor. He's a selfish loser in the beginning and just the same in the end. Doesn't go see his daughter, doesn't share some of the money he won with the really poor. And his sudden change of morality just didn't ring true with me.BUT, having said all this, after seeing the similar series ""Alice in Borderland"", I have to say I thought this way better. It certainly had me hooked all the way through. So I'd still recommend it if this type of story is your thing. The cinematography was great. And - I came back to add this - it really WAS very colourful and creepy (those masks, with different ranks according to symbol, and the private island), and not mainstream, and very entertaining."
514,Squid Game,"I wanted to like this. I love Asian film and TV from most of their countries, and this entry started interesting enough but even some of the initial elements forbode what my instincts told me would be a lame ending, thus maintaining the ""we don't care what we put out"" tradition of crappy Netflix fare. 9 hours to a horrible disappointing payoff. It started to go off the rails and become a self righteous preachy mess around episode 4. I won't give away the ending but I warned you, though I'm sure the lemmings who follow anything will applaud it."
515,Squid Game,"I get why this show is so praised. The idea is simple yet very well executed. The asthetic and decors, and musics are amazing. BUT, the dialogs, the script and the acting are way over acted. Nobody talk like any of the character and it is sometimes really awkward. It is even more obvious when VIP talks. It is painfull to watch.There are all the stereotypical characters we have seen a million time : The benevolent hero, the cool/cold chick, the mysterious connection, the old wise man, the pure villain.... and when you start to think about the entire plot, nothing make sense. Also, the twist ending is way too predictable. I called it on episode 2 and then told myself ''no, they wouldnt go there, it is way too easy''. Yep, they totally did. This show could have been made in the 80's and then maybe, they would have some original idea. Aside from the premise, a lot of trope are copy paste from american's thriller.I was dying lauging when the face scan his mask."
516,Squid Game,...But then I saw the American actors that play a role and I knew that all the acting was really bad.Starts off shocking and kinda intriguing and fades into being dumb and boring. Had a hard time paying attention by the end.
517,Squid Game,"The main character is a foolish, clueless, impulsive, emotionally self-indulgent jerk.Other characters, flawed but fundamentally good people, die getting him back to the real world with that 45.6B won (~40M USD), but what does he do for the first year of having all that money? Does he help any of the loved ones left behind by those people who died getting him there with all that money?No, he leaves them all hanging, suffering for another year in the circumstances that were so bad it caused those good people who died saving him to go into and then back into that bloody Hell to try to save them.And then what does he do when he decides to go after the people behind the game? He calls them up and threatens them, making sure they know he's an enemy to be removed.He's a very unpleasant, impulsive and judgmental fool. Fortunately, although he's clearly the main character from start to finish, he doesn't dominate too much screen time, and there are plenty of other characters to enjoy watching .... although they pretty much all die."
518,Squid Game,"Boring and uninspired, backed up by great marketing. After two episodes i was done, soo boring and simple story.The best thing about it must be the costumes, good design."
519,Squid Game,"A movie would have been way too short and required some serious character cuts, however 9 episodes was also too long. There were a lot of lull moments that either dragged or unnecessary side stories that contributed very little to the overall story and arc of the protagonists. Had this been sliced down into 4 or 5 episodes, the overall pacing would have been much better and created an overall more intense viewing experience to constantly kept viewers on edge. A little trimming and this would handily have been a solid 10/10 experience at how fervent and enrapturing the story moves.One thing also worth commenting is that Netflix indirectly spoils the final episode. On the parental guidance at the top of the screen, the 'suicide' word appears, ultimately revealing the outcome of the final game (even though it was rather predictable, it does confirm it).Not a bad series and worth watching, just do not watch all 9 episodes in a row or the story may move too slowly. It would be better with some time between episodes so you can build anticipation."
520,Squid Game,"Those of you complaining about the VIPs are completely missing the point. This show is so damn clever. The VIPs are meant to be over the top, gaudy, and obnoxious. They're representing the type of rich, entitled aholes that enjoy this kind of entertainment. These are the same guys that would set up a game of hunting for humans. Fantastic show."
521,Squid Game,"Highly disappointed. The show started great but the ending is stupid as hell. I feels like I wasted my time watching this because so many things were left out. I am assuming there is another season into play but so far, I am giving it a solid three. I'll come back and change my review once they fix this crap."
522,Squid Game,Kim joo & doek su are the ugliest people in this movie!!! The sex scene between the two made me vomit to the point where I had to stop watching the show.
523,Squid Game,"I've watched too many power house Korean movies for this to have much of an impact on me. Sounds very pretentious me saying this but if you've watched movies like Oldboy, memories of murder, chaser, I saw the devil, (these are just scratching the surface) then you'll know exactly what I mean. This just doesn't hit the same way they do, I feel like this could possible be because it is being released on Netflix but whatevs - I wasn't left gripping my seat the same way they do.Might not be a good thing honestly comparing this series to them with being completely different premises, but honestly this doesn't come close. What I love about this show is that it will open up a lot of people who aren't particularly regulars with watching something foreign, and show them what is out there to dive into and will break that barrier of entry down to make them go discover more film from this absolute master race of film makers, actors and story tellers. Mark my words NO ONE DOES IT BETTER THAN THE KOREANS. It's just a shame that because the popularity this has seen so far will start to cloud over the absolute master pieces these people are capable of and have produced."
524,Squid Game,"You haven't seen the series, so please don't rate...Saw this before all the hype, first day it came out, fell in love instantly."
525,Squid Game,"It's an okay series, but I really don't think it's hypeworthy. Most, if not all, elements of the series have been there before, but better. Only distinguishing feature is that it's korean.What really bothered me was: Overacting a lot of times. Or is that just a cultural thing?Cringeworthy dialogues from all people involved (especially the bad guys).Certain storylines just fizzle out into nothingness. What's the purpose of having them then?"
526,Squid Game,Thriller and entertaining series..hope we will get a season 2..really excited. The casting and acting are awesome. The directing is good and also the secenerios are pleassant to watch. Its really full of viloence so love who dont like action or like that shouldn't watch.
527,Squid Game,"My ratings are always either 1,5 or 10. I gave this 5 because it's not a 10. It would have to be exceptional to get a 10 on my scale.People that are reviewing this as a game are completely missing the point. The show is meant to be a commentary on the current world we live in and how broken the system is. It is also meant to show people the mirror so they can look at their behaviour in society and realize how they currently live their lives. It shows the dark nature of human behaviour and how easily we are manipulated by the system."
528,Squid Game,"Since watching the series ""Squid Game"" I have come across some criticism from viewers claiming that the show is being given too much credit and that it's somewhat overrated. For me, it's hard to deny how great the series is - it's filled with compelling visuals and plenty of powerful characters. The pink-suit guards in black masks really draws the viewer in, the look is intimidating yet oddly fascinating and almost mesmerizing, and I believe the most iconic thing about the show (at least visually). As for the acting, Park Hae-soo is incredible as the dubious yet likeable Cho Sang-woo, while Lee Jung-jae perfectly captures the desperation and sadness of the show's main protagonist Seong Gi-hun. With plenty of gut-wrenching action and gory violence, Squid Game will keep you guessing right to the last episode. So curl up on the couch, grab some Dalgona cookies and enjoy binging on Squid Game...just don't pick the damn umbrella..."
529,Squid Game,I gave it 4 episodes in the hope it would be something different from what I have seen before.
530,Squid Game,"Most of Hollywood and almost every single(once beloved franchise) turned their backs on the customers. Too busy to lecture us and shove their woke religion down our throats but many other countries still make movies and series to entertain. To give us escapism, good story lines, thrills, believable characters with backgrounds and struggles, some who you despise, some who you care for, many of them grey and no political propaganda.No obvious message from the rich elite in Hollywood. No forced identity (with the exception of the elite watching the fights (poor acting, the sole downside of the movie) but real identities (e.g. Different characters).No all-powerful protagonists. Not total conformism. When a girl or woman fights a man it's believable and no preaching. I love it. No endless preaching from the hypocrites (which constantly pulls you out of the movie experience) but good 'le inventive and exciting entertainment.This is a high quality dystopian series from our Korean friends.If you are sick to the back teeth of modern day Hollywood sensibilities and microagressions like 95% of mankind then watch this macro aggression series. Highly recommended."
531,Squid Game,"This series gets a 6 overall...For the concept and cinematography, this deserves a 7... Well filmed and good use of lighting and colours... The costume was vibrant and eye catching but rather bland after a couple of episodes... Some parts felt disjointed and out of place...The script in terms of story and logic gets a 6... Some illogical occurrences and lapses in a supposedly tightly controlled environment... Some characters seem to overreact all the time while some felt detached and unaffected...""normal"" people seldom react similarly under duress but a few characters do not seem involved...a few act overly cool towards ""friends"" and a few overly warm towards ""adversaries""...
Perhaps there were too many characters to properly develop but even the main ones aren't 'likeable' enough to root for... And most of the plot became predictable before the half way mark..The acting was the major let down for me and scored between a 4 and a 5.... While there were some great moments yet generally throughout, acting weren't believable... Fear and anger felt under whelming, aggression and obnoxious behaviours seemed overplayed... And some characters over act to clownish proportions...a few of the characters also don't feel consistent, suddenly brave then turn cowardly or vice versa...I found most of the characters unrelatable at many points of the story development... This is partly the fault of the script but the acting or over-acting didn't help...Can't say much more without giving spoilers away... Overall, quite enjoyable but not one where I felt the need to keep chasing the next installment... Continue watching was to just check if my prediction is somewhat accurate instead of a need to find out what happens next... This point is where I feel the series is a let down...Combining the above assessment, an average score of 5.5 to 6 seems fair... Wish they paid more attention to the details... Game of thrones this isn't, well maybe just a below par season 8 of GOT... ""Could have been much better"" is the general feeling..."
532,Squid Game,"This show is a great Korean drama adventure that will make the audience at their edge all the time, well written and great acting.Hands up for Netflix & Korea for deliver this show and looking forward for more cooperation to come in the near future.Unpopular opinion: This V. I. P characters acting is dumb and the way they talk is annoying but I think a human enjoy watching other people suffering has to be dumb and have a brain damage somehow!!"
533,Squid Game,"Absolute masterpiece and a must watch. It has excellent premise, gripping & binge-worthy development, perfectly handle twist & turns, fantastic character arcs and overall exceptional writing and acting!It's near the realm of perfection with little to complain but if I have to nitpick, my only minor gripes are:
1. Motivation revealed in last episode could have been more...philosophical (maybe it's lost in translation)
2. VIPs acting are really bad, like...they supposed to be world's richest a-holes, not jerk high schooler reading off a drama script..."
534,Squid Game,Classic example of the madness of crowds. How it has become so popular so fast means there is an agenda somewhere to push this.
535,Squid Game,Good show. Interesting characters. Well produced. Stellar acting.
536,Squid Game,"I fail to see what got people so hyped about this. It is slow, veeeeryyy predictable, characters not relatable at all, long winded bathetic (yes that is a word) scenes, borderline annoying characters, no skill or smarts needed only luck, very poorly written ""twists"" that fail to be twists and so on... This is a huuuggeee disappointment."
537,Squid Game,"Squid Game is essentially a terrible indictment of society whereby contestants are so downtrodden and made desperate by life in the real world that they're willing to enter a fabricated, deadly gameshow world to solve their real world problems with money. Although this show demonstrates that money certainly doesn't solve everything like you think it will. The show also highlights that as with real current events in the early 2020s, some elites are bored and perverted and take pleasure in having people abused and exploited for their entertainment. This series has got it all, great action, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, co-operation, revenge, family, greed, horror, plot twists, suspense and some very touching moments.Everyone involved with this production should be proud of themselves, the set designers and builders, the lighting technicians, the actors, the director, the writers, the people that chose the music and costume design."
538,Squid Game,"A series with completely unique n innovative script ever! Portrays all human emotions of helplessness, greed, competition, violence, deceit, struggle, guilt. A true master creation at its best!"
539,Squid Game,"Whilst initially i took the bait like the rest of humanity but it didn't take long to discover the simplistic predictable storyline & let me say ""unique"" acting performances. But let's face, i don't thing anything in human history is capable of living up to that nonsensical level of hype. Massive credit goes to the creation of the concept but i genuinely believe this should have been a movie not a series."
540,Squid Game,"Actually, i didn't watch any korean movies or series before. But i believe that no one denies that this show is one of the greatest shows ""this year at least""."
541,Squid Game,"Hi, my name is sam and i haven't watched any korean show or movie before but this show was the trend in 2021 so i decided to watch it and see if it was a cool show or not.Well, let's talk about the story! The story was pretty damn cool and full of excitement, but there are some nonsensical points like bringing you WIFE into this game.... AGAIN!. Also, the officer, his phone did not run out of battery! It was turned on for like 3 days but the battery didn't run out HOW! Speaking of the officer, why did the director create a very stupid twist at the end????????????? Why did he make the brother of the officer is the one who made the game? What a stupid twist! The twist of the player number 1 at the end of the show is WAY more clever than this. And the vip....... THOSE ARE HERE TO JUST TALK! THERE IS NO ACTING, JUST TALK! Also all of them are Americans.... wait what? How? Haven't you said that this game has a lot of departments around the world? This means that the vips should have different nationalities? This is one of many many dark and nonsensical points. If just the director took a little more time to only focus on them, this show could have been the best korean short show of all time maybeat last, i can't deny how much i loved this show and how much of the enthusiasm i had to watch one more episode of it, .But if you look at it logically, you would see what i mean.My final rating is 8.5/10.Is it worth watching?: yes, it is
do i want a second season: no, that's enough
Does it deserve an award?: Depending on the acting and the music, yes, it does."
542,Squid Game,"It's not that good as everybody says, it was a good concept but... It's just not that good and overrated -, _-, My review has to have at least 150 characters co i will say a fun fact: ants doesn't have lungs."
543,Squid Game,"I like it, but I don't love it. I would've loved to love it though, since it had great potential. I like the plot and characters. The set dressing is pretty cool. Even the soundtrack is pretty nice. The fact that it's a Korean production just made it feel like something a bit more curious to me. But it had three predictable elements in its plot that made me like it and not love it. Without spoiling it, it involves the detective's missing brother, a certain player and the outcome of the game. Another point of criticism is that I found some games to be lacking a little punch. I would still recommend to watch this series if you're a fan of the genre since it is both entertaining and memorable."
544,Squid Game,"The South Korean film Parasite should've gotten the same amount of hype this show received. First off cringe worthy costume designs they looked too basic, childish, and uncreative. The story had real world implications but felt like a weird lazy rip off of the movie saw with weak writing. It got so predictable and dull I didn't even watch the last two episodes. Overall, watch it if you don't mind cheap storytelling. If you haven't seen Parasite by Bong Joon-ho, then that's a better use of your time."
545,Squid Game,"The American voice actors don't really have the passion that the real actors have, so if you can live without the English dubbing then watch it with subtitles. Trust me, you'll understand why if you rewatch parts with the English overdubs. Also, there's a fair few writing issues and plot holes that may be just due to the way it was translated so it's not a flawless series but it's still a great series despite these letdowns."
546,Squid Game,"If you have seen hostel ....then this series is just 100000000 times BETTER!!!!Unbelievable , thrill that gives you chill and makes you shrill !!!!The scenes are prolific that it stems SHOCK & AWE !MUST WATCH."
547,Squid Game,"This is one of the best series I have ever seen. Prepare yourself, however, to be anxious and have your heart ripped out thanks to episode 6."
548,Squid Game,"I must say I started watching this because everyone is/was talking about it. So I went in expecting not very much, but I was wrong.This show blew me away by the amazing story and the incredible performance of the actors (minus the VIP's).It really strung me along till the very end and it didn't bore me a second.Amazing show, very different from anything I had seen before.Overall 9/10."
549,Squid Game,"It's a good series. Is it as good as Alice in Borderland, not really, this one, while having more realistic qualities, is basically that series meets Parasite with a light flavoring of Saw series. Outside of the main character there isn't much in the way of an engaging cast. In fact towards the end of the series you're rooting against most of them. The side story was particularly laboring and disengaging. The theming is little too blatant and bordering on sophomoric. It's really just not that clever, despite the hype. It is a good series, and of course being a K series social and economic injustice is deeply threaded into the theme. Like I said though, it's enjoyable, worth the watch but not as thoughtful as it tries so hard to be."
550,Squid Game,"Some spoilers here, and this review is before season 2 comes out, but this show was a solid 7/10 for me. There was plenty to love, as you could really get invested in some of the characters which are all very realistic in their own way. This show is aesthetically pleasing, with great directing and acting. Interesting plot that mostly delivers on the setup. Finally, the score really works well with this show and the tone is very consistent throughout.For me though, I couldn't go higher than a 7 because of the, in my opinion, weak twists that happened and the lack of explanation given to some aspects of the story. The final twist was unknowingly foreshadowed with small hints, but the choice of the twist with what we were shown feels kind of forced and pointless to me. The frontman twist went nowhere, leaving you with more questions than answers, and really not much care for that character. Finally, the show has a bit of a slow start that completely focuses on Gi-Hun, which really took away the tension of who will live and die because I'm just thinking ""this is our main character and there's only one winner"" the whole time. These things took away from my enjoyment of the show, but overall it is still great and I can see why so many people are loving it- I will be trying out season 2 when it arrives although I am slightly skeptical of where they can go from here if they focus on Gi-Hun."
551,Squid Game,"About wolves and sheep in this world.Rich People playing God with the unfortunate and someone's version about right and wrong.Over emotional actors.Speculation on outcomes.I gave a 6 for effort and suspense held.I did predict the ending early in the movie but not sure how others faired.Stupid ending. What, oh a sequel? Meh, I'll pass."
552,Squid Game,"At the end of the third episode, I felt I had enough of this show. I could not mind a message or entertainment to get me interested in the shallow plot. I also had to wonder what individuals see in this type of violence. Just could find anything to keep me interested and not turned off. Wait one thing, the first episode which was slow did give a visual of Korea and I presume Seoul. This was the worst simply put with no redeeming values. Big turnoff."
553,Squid Game,"Korean TV shows are traditionally a step below their movies, which have been the best in the world for a while now. With its budget, production quality and talent Squid Game could have been the one show that got away but all is sadly ruined by Lee Jung-jae overacting pretty much every scene he's in, he just doesn't seem to be able to ground his character. Granted, some of the writing is over the top too, which doesn't help but the director should have helped him calibrate. In comparison Gong Yoo and especially Lee Byung-hun own the screen and ooze charisma every single time despite very brief appearances.It's still a good show and overall quite watchable but it's just not great."
554,Squid Game,"I didn't think the lead actor was likeable in the first episode but found myself rooting for him after episode 2. The games were so creepy. Children's games that if you lose, you die, in horrible bloody circumstances. Whittling the players down to one ultimate cash prize winner. So there's a lot of violence and death. Now, this programme could have been higher rated had it not been for one thing: The VIPs. My gosh how embarrassingly cringeworthy are they! They ought to be glad their faces were mainly hidden! I'm not sure if it was a budgeting thing and they were hired on the cheap as western actors. Or if their performances translated better for Korean viewers, as foreign actors. I doubt it though. They really let the show down. However, i'll still give it an 8 for the concept, production and delivery and the Korean actors."
555,Squid Game,"This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.The only major problem I have with it is the acting.It's not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting."
556,Squid Game,"Squid games is another one of those concepts which we have seen quite a few times before(Battle Royale, Hunger games, Belko Experiment, Escape Room...).A bunch of people locked up in an environment where they have to battle it out to the death, all for a cash price for 45.6 billion or something.The games are all unique, all the type which we probably have played before as kids. With the added incentive of life or death there is a real intensity to these games which intrigues us throughout.The characters all have unique and relatable motivations and circumstances. They all need money for one reason or another be it for themselves, their family members , debts, etc.The characters surprisingly are very well written and rounded up which is what keeps us hooked right unitl the end and perhaps seperates this show from other violent shows.The show throws concepts of morality in the face of adversity, consumerism, democracy, class separation, gender equality, all very subtly and naturally weaving and fitting into the story without taking any unneccesary stops.It lets you form your own opinion of these concepts and themes instead of drilling its own politics into you.From the standards of storytelling in modern times its Oscar worthy!The ending revelations perhaps felt uninspired even if they were executed well(driven mostly by the actors performances and direction),
the twists and turns ranged from genuinely shocking, emotional to 'Havent we seen that somewhere else?'.Yes the plot twists at the end remind you of Escape Room perhaps even of Hunger Games or Battle Royale but the writing and character development is what elevates the show a notch above.I dont think we need a sequel....the show is clearly one of the best of the year."
557,Squid Game,Overhyped show for CW teens. Don't trust other reviews.
558,Squid Game,"It would probably be more thought-provoking if it weren't for the glaring errors.Also, it proved to be rather something of a bait and switch. First, they say it's all about pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps but it turns out to be something quite different. Everyday, vulgar banality is all it was, after all."
559,Squid Game,"To be honest, the first time I found out about ""Squid Game"" was when I was traveling home and a passenger on my bus was watching it on his cell phone. After doing some research to confirm, I tried to avoid spoilers until I could see it, but in less than 24 hours the entire internet was filled with it. That forced me to abstain from watching the series for a few days until the boom subsided.After finally observing the 9 chapters, I can share the following points. Personally, I really liked the social message that the series shared, of how they gave Korean children's games of the 70s and 80s a dark twist, and the chemistry between the characters and their individual development. I would have easily given it an 8, if not for two downsides.The first was the way the story was told. At first, it was able to take off without any problem but it became unstable until the end of the season, which in my opinion could have been better. Apart from that, the police side-plot must also have been developed better. They gave him considerable screening time, only to stop with a clichéd Star Wars-type moment? I mean, what the heck?The second is related to the characters. Although the characters had good chemistry with each other and a good, but slow individual development, the same cannot be said about the audience; since they felt a bit generic and the charisma was almost non-existent (especially with the main character).In short, ""The Squid Game"" is not a bad series, but I consider it highly overrated from what I had to see. If in such case Netflix renews it for a Season 2, it is necessary that improvements be made, especially with the writing part. I give it a 6.5/10."
560,Squid Game,"First of all, this show will gut you like a fish and use your soul for chum. It's ultra-violent, graphic, and so intense that sometimes I felt sick. I cried a few times but mostly I was just becoming as damaged as the contestants. This show will MESS. YOU. UP. It is hella dark, hella bleak, and once you start it, you won't be able to stop until you know who wins the game. I need Season 2, please.This is NOT Alice in Borderland!!! This is NOT The Hunger Games!!! This isn't Battle Royale.Yes, the same most basic of premise is there. But this show stands alone.Watch it at your own peril. But Watch It."
561,Squid Game,"Brilliance at its finest. Correlating with modern times and capitalism, the symbolism and valuable lessons in this show make this emotional thriller a must see. Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk along with his talented cast, create intense dialogue, beautiful visuals and scenes that are absolutely unforgettable. Watching this was refreshing and exciting."
562,Squid Game,"To be honest, it's cliche, nonsensible & horrible art-design. Whole storyline is quite boring. We can see the aim-system bypassed the old man at the very beginning, and we know there's something on it.It get the high ratings, but beneath it's not a bad tv drama series, and that's all of it - just a not-bad one."
563,Squid Game,"There are a lot of holes in the plot...Many, maybe too many.But I had a nice time, which is the objective of entertainment.My grade:
Acting (Korean style): 3/3
Scenario (some flaws): 2/3
Production (inconsistencies): 2/3
No cancel culture, gay couples, or save the planet BS: 1/1."
564,Squid Game,"This is a show written for and by mainstream human brains that are obsessed with social connections, and enjoy spending every waking minute contemplating about the meaning and weight behind social interactions.It is not good material for those of us who repurpose our neurons for more interesting things.It is possible to skip 70% of the material without losing sight of the simple story construct, and you still get to claim to have watched it."
565,Squid Game,"This show was amazing, apart from the thrill, drama and violence, it tried to show the social inequalities that people have to live with and they fight to survive! Yet another Korean masterpiece."
566,Squid Game,"The first 5 episodes are cool. Then the rest is sooooo boring , lonnnng and predictable. Dont let me start about the finale which is a mess and dosen't make sense.Thank god succession is coming back tonight, a real show with talent ."
567,Squid Game,I thought this Season of Squid Game was done so well. So many emotions and characters to follow. I never thought of South Korea as coming out with something so good...such a pleasant surprise. I can't wait for Season 2 (perfect ending to a great Season-obviously there will be a 2nd Season).Great job-keep up the good work!!Anyone worried about it being in Korean-just watch in English and put English subtitles on. You'll never know the difference.
568,Squid Game,"Right off the bat, I smelled something fishy when Player 1 was actually Player 1. There were plenty of plotholes such as:Gi-hun owed the loan sharks and he tells them he'll pay them in full ""next month"" but we learn that he hasn't touched his winnings from the account so how did he pay them off?Diagnosed with diabetes and nearing amputation, Gi-hun's mother is not even in the hospital upon his return but dead on the floor. How long has she been dead?The cop has played every move smartly up until sending the evidence to the police which ruins the whole angleThe cop's brother ""won"" the game but then becomes the Front Man and then kills his cop brother? Why?How did Gi-hun know exactly where to find the girl's little brother?All winners presumably are allowed to go free. What stops them from uncovering this game conspiracy? If any of the past winners accumulated together, they could bring down the corporationIn the first instance, Gi-hun could have asked the cop to insert a tracking device on Gi-hun so when he went to the game the second time, the police could track his locationThere was no rule against crawling in the 6th game when they're crossing the glass. Two people can stand on one tempered tile while one person is crawling ahead. If the glass ahead breaks, the person with them (behind them) can just pull the person who starts falling by their legs and hoist them back upTo my knowledge, tempered glass doesn't shatter. It webs up as we see on a car's windshield. Even so, a huge chunk of glass hits the girl and she bleeds profusely which doesn't seem plausible at allThere are presumably 456 players when the games are starting. They could have easily constructed a human pyramid to reach the money inside the chamber. A few of them could have blocked the doors to stop the guards from entering. Alternatively, the players could have also overpowered the guards by their sheer number alone.Why didn't the cop trigger the bombs when he was escaping?When the cop sneaks into the van as a player, the guards are scanning the players behind their ears. What exactly are they scanning for?"
569,Squid Game,"Ok, I have to get this off my chest. It really annoys me when people just don't give a realistic review of movies and tv shows because giving something 10 and saying 'best thing ever!' or a 1 (or even 0) and saying 'worst thing ever!' serve no purpose except to feel the gap some people have in their life for a hobby... I find it especially annoying when people rate something zero and say 'I was bored after 10 minutes so turned off' - hey buddy, don't review it then if you're not mature enough to invest some time! Go watch some Tik Tok videos instead!Ok, rant over lol.I put this on for the sake of having something in the background while I worked from home. It was a huge mistake as I kept concentrating on the show with work in the background! Sorry boss :) I did however change it to other ""stuff"" when I realised it was a show I wanted to watch.The basic premise is simple - people with huge debts and nothing really to live for are offered a part in 6 games and the winner gets huge amounts of money. Simples. What they don't know is that they might die...I don't know how they do it, but Korea just nails it when it comes to creating characters that are fallible but likeable. They even make bad guys, real a-holes, somehow relatable and fleshed out so they're not just one dimensional villains.Anyway, I won't spoil anything for anyone except to say it's really very good :) It doesn't glorify the deaths, they're grim and matter of fact and as the series progresses, because they've developed characters and you've invested in them then their deaths hit pretty hard :( I sort of assumed that more would survive but this feels like it's completely self contained like they didn't expect a second series.Watch it, enjoy it - or not - just don't come in and review it like a child afterwards."
570,Squid Game,"Dong-hyuk Hwang starts out with what seems to be a typical Korean drama and by the end of it we've been through ""Battle Royale"", ""Hunger Games"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and a Bond movie - complete with plot twists, Kubrik-esque visual easter-eggs, and social commentary delivered with a side-dish of disturbing trauma.Squid game is about a group of people recruited to play lethal games for prize money, but it is more than that. It is a commentary about the nature of human competition, the endless class war, the illusion of wealth. Read into it a bit more closely and you'll all about the levers of control our governments and rulers have over us all.The most obvious theme is the love and sacrifice that others have to make for us to succeed in life. Some people seem to think that this is a critique of capitalism, but capitalism isn't a zero-sum game like Squid Game is.With this deep commentary underlying the action - being carefully shown and not told to us - Squid Game is an unmissable watch.Negatives? The ending was a bit flat. It flirted with the idea of tying up all lose ends into a satisfying thematic conclusion - but in the end, the actual conclusion was a little less than satisfying and opened up more questions than it actually resolved. That's perfect for a sequel season - if we get one."
571,Squid Game,A very well directed series with not so many flaws. I loved the acting of all thr main characters and this series is sort of an emotional one than anything else. This shows the problems each character is facing in their day to day lives and how they were emotionally drawn into this SQUID GAME. I'm loving it and have stopped watching the cheesy MONEY HEIST.
572,Squid Game,"What a show. Keeps you gripped all the way through. Brilliant concept, well acted (other than the VIPs) and you never get too connected to one character as they are all horrible so you don't get too upset when one dies like in other shows."
573,Squid Game,"Imagine, that you're jumping on glass plates 200 meters above the ground, and your game mates pushing you to do it more quickly... And you volunteered to participate in this brutal game. Good story. Pity that not every episode was interesting enough."
574,Squid Game,Nice and innovative concept of this korean web series. From start to end it is nice to watch. Also very emotional at the end. Very few series has such a new concept.
575,Squid Game,"Kinda sad Korean dramas had to ""westernize"" themselves this much to go trending. The show isn't bad but it isn't jaw dropping. It has none of the charms kdrama lovers enjoy that are exclusive to the Korean culture. This is another western show with Korean people in it."
576,Squid Game,"If not the best new show on TV--and it may be exactly that--certainly one of the most outrageous. Set in South Korea, it stars Lee Jung-jae as a hardcore gambler in debt to the mob with child support payments he can't maintain and medical bills for his ailing mom that he can no longer afford to pay. When he is offered a chance to make a not-so-small fortune by competing against several hundred other desperate souls in a high-stakes series of childrens' games, he grabs it--with absolutely no idea of what he has signed up for. At first, there's a repetitiveness to it all--everyone competes, the losers are massacred in a horrible bloodbath, the winners move on, rinse and repeat--and, terrifying as the story quickly becomes, you may start wondering if that's all there is. But then episodes six and seven come along, the suspense is ratcheted up even higher, the pool of players is winnowed down to a precious few, and the action really takes off. (Who knew that an ordinary game of marbles could turn into such a nailbiter?) The premise is brilliant, the acting is magnificent (Jung-jae, with his large eyes and expressive face, leads an extraordinarily talented cast), and the stunt work is amazing. Not for the faint of heart--there are more corpses here than at your local boneyard--but if you can stomach the more cringeworthy moments, ""Squid Game"" is quite a ride. The ending is a jaw-dropper, too. It's already been renewed for a second season, and I can't wait."
577,Squid Game,"This series isn't overrated to me. It's what I needed to see.Hldhyorljycljdtufuepiilufidyksutdhl.Kgtkskydytiskgsuifoydlhydkhl

578,Squid Game,"Squid Game offers a breath of fresh air into 2021's drama/thrillers.With unpredictable twists around every corner, excellent acting and writing, this show is taking the world by storm - and for a good reason."
579,Squid Game,"I love this show. The series is very tense, with steaks being very high. It also has a lot of commentary on some of the toxicity in competition and discrimination. I loved this, but I have one major issue. 3 of the episodes aren't good, and this isn't the kind of series where you can skip over one episode and still be able to follow the story. I enjoyed this, but I'm not really going to watch it again."
580,Squid Game,It had good moments till vip episode but overall games sucked and too childish and then the ending and last few episodes sucked..........................
581,Squid Game,"*Roughly Translated From Brazilian Portuguese.Series Review - Squid Game (Season 1).I confess that I went to watch this series thinking it would not be good. As much as she has been voted the most viewed in the world recently, I was too suspicious of her potential, thinking that it could be a shallow plot, just a ""popocão"" to marathon. I was wrong.The show is very balanced, it has a plot, it has good characters, and it grips you in a very smooth way, where you're tempted to keep watching, episode after episode.Overall, it's guaranteed fun. The show's aesthetic alone tells us not to take it too seriously, so don't. Skip the details and have fun.Out of respect for the great old series, which were extremely well done, I won't give it a higher rating, but it's a very good series.Good for a marathon on a Saturday after lunch, alone or with others.Rating: 4/5 - Very good series."
582,Squid Game,"The movie is allegorical to various ideas, from brutality of the people to that of the social, financial and political systems. From gaming the system, to playing the system, and being played by the system. Is all Korean in the representation of those ideas after that. After watching a couple of Old Boy(s) sort of movies, the thriller of plot turns and the display of certain characters seem too repetitive.Nevertheless, it is well-made. And it has the potential of becoming the best show worldwide if they iinternationalize it. There are kids' games in my country that have the potential of being far more brutal with the proper setting.Bit is atrociius writing this revuew in Android."
583,Squid Game,"Sadly and stupidly I watched every episode.Easily predictable on what happens and who's who.The acting is woeful with even worse dubbing. If I can remember who recommended this to me, i'd throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting 9 hours of my life on utter dross.It's not unique it's not different. It's all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surpriseIf I can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done."
584,Squid Game,"Loses points only for the final reveal, which was a bit anticlimactic, and the bafflingly awful, stilted acting of the American VIPs.Otherwise, definitely worth the watch."
585,Squid Game,"People have been rightly comparing this gem to the Hunger Games, and to some extent they're right; however, to oversimplify the show as another ""Dystopian Future Game Show"" drama risks looking over the masterful character work, the wildly impressive production design and cinematography, and of course the top-tier acting from everyone involved (yes, that includes the VIPs).Everyone involved in making this, please take a bow. I look forward to where this story goes."
586,Squid Game,"Entertaining enough. The main character is super annoying. The end (explanation) is plain weak and goes ridiculously against human nature, therefore it weakens the premise of the 'games'."
587,Squid Game,"Squid Game could have been an amazing show, but at an average of 55 episodes, it's filled with so much bloat.It needed to be 6-8 half hour episodes.It is fantastic, stylishly shot and has so much going for it, but boy does it need an edit. Episode 2 was entirely pointless and ridiculous in the extreme.So much I could say, but I'd love to see a vastly cut down version, or a 2 hour movie - the running length is really the only thing spoiling what could have been truly legendary."
588,Squid Game,This is definitely the most diverse drama I've watched it really is like no other drama I binged it in two days it kept me hooked first episode hopefully there is a second season because whilst the concept was gruesome and inhumane I really enjoyed watching it.
589,Squid Game,"With nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey (Blue Danube score and depth of meaning regarding some of the eliminations) and Battle Royale (an all out fight for survival), whilst some of the acting leaves much to be desired, the concept and plot raises this to be an addictive, binge worthy series.Granted I watched this with the English dubbing, which may lose some of the intended dialogue, but the main characters give a boost to the otherwise mediocre acting of some of the other members of the cast.The story - albeit an old one of man versus man in a primordial sense - is engaging and keeps you interested. The side story of the masked individuals is perhaps an unnecessary addition, and I found it disengaging from the main plot. That being said, if you ignore it and focus on the primary plot, it can be forgiven.Overall 8/10. Watch it and enjoy!"
590,Squid Game,"Great acting, very interesting storyline. As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am watching the show without having to rely on the subtitles. As someone who is also fluent in English, I am reading the subtitles as well. I cannot believe that this high budget production is ruined by shockingly poor translation. For non-Korean speakers who must rely on the subtitles, please believe me when I tell you that the actual dialog is not that poor. It's shame that Netflix does not have any QC over translated subtitles."
591,Squid Game,"I must say, Squid Game kind of entertained me! The concept was really fun and intriguing and that led to some very fun and memorable scenes.However, I felt that there could have been so many better ways for this show to go. Like I said it is a great concept but I thought the execution could have been so much better and more enjoyable. It all just becoming so predictable with every game who would survive and who wouldn't. Especially with the game in episode 6. The moment the game was announced I knew what would happen. That didn't mean it was a bad episode because still, some stuff happens which was nicely executed. But because it was so predictable for me it kind of ruined the great moments.The acting was decent and some of the characters were semi enjoyable. But I felt that the whole cop storyline was so slow and boring. And the twist for him at the end didn't work and was just so unnecessary.Overall the show was fun to watch but defiantly nothing special. I have no idea why there is so much hype for this and I'm afraid with more seasons coming it will only milk it out as much as it can.I would rate this show a 6.5/10."
592,Squid Game,"We all know this Show broke records and became really famous, and for good reason. It has a really good concept and Good actors. The Korean actors atleast, the VIPs literally made me want to punch something, so cheesy it was painful to watch. But other than that the rest of the show was awesome and fun to watch.Also I hate episode 6."
593,Squid Game,"The plot is super interesting! It offers you almost identical storyline to the one of Alice in borderland, but it's even better. The characters are all round, none of them are flat. The gore is great and it does leave you on the brink of being creeped out by the events it creates. Love every bit of it. Moreover, the plot twist at the end is really well done, if you keep your eyes peeled at every little detail, you can figure it out yourself, but it's not really all that simple.Really recommend it to everyone. Very interesting and can't wait for season 2."
594,Squid Game,"If you like Battle Royale, The Prisoner, Hunger Games and a good drama - this is for you.Set in South Korea in the present day, this series is a stark look at what people will do when society has failed them - richly character driven and with a wonderfully original take on the sinister, this is a Netflix series that has depth, drama, entertainment and shock-value.It's a not afraid to be a slow burner at times, but the mystery and slight surrealist nature of 'The Game' drives your attention throughout.It's worth watching and taking time over. Really recommended."
595,Squid Game,Wow! Amazing show worth watching for sure. Concept was so good. The VIPs doe.. their acting was weird. Other than that the whole show keeps you on the edge.. the characters were really well played and I can't wait for the next season.
596,Squid Game,"After reading and seeing stories like Liar Game, Kaiji and multiple Battle Royale clones over 20 years ago this one doesn't bring anything new to the table. Not only isn't it the first, but Squid Game isn't even among the best of its kind.To be fair my main critique isn't the old concept. A more glaring issue is with some core points like the Jigsaw like reveal that I found rather predictable.The ending itself and Seong Gi-Hun's decision is incomprehensible as well. If you just think back to all the games it's clear that he only survived by luck or help or pity from the other contestants. There's really only one game to give him full credit for. Taking this into account his decision at the end of joining the next game doesn't make any sense.Aside from some character inconsistencies or rather incomprehensible acts by some characters like Seong Gi-Hun, Oh Il-nam and Front Man the characters were really great and fleshed out. Definitely one of the best things about this show."
597,Squid Game,"This is one of the best shows I've watched. The production quality all around is superb. The directing, cinematography, the script, the overall writing, the cast, and above all, the acting. Every single detail was chosen to perfection. Even watching in English, it's amazingly well-developed. Full 10/10, one of the best shows in years. Go watch it!"
598,Squid Game,"It gets one extra star for being somewhat creative at times. But otherwise I have no idea how anyone can stand this show.The main character is so awful and unlikable that it kind of ruins the show from the beginning. Why would we even care if he lives or dies? He's an unbelievably crap person. The acting is atrocious all around. Doesn't matter if you watch it in Korean or dubbed, it's forced like high schoolers trying out for the drama program.Plot twists? There are a few, but I had no trouble predicting them once the show gave you enough hints.The ""Game"" itself? Boring and drawn out.Couldn't finish the show but I heard the last episode sucks anyway."
599,Squid Game,"Battle Royale, As The Gods Will (literally about kid's games in a death challenge environment), Alice in Borderland, Hunger Games, etc. And those are just the Asian ones...This really didn't do anything special or anything unique. The story dragged on during some moments, wouldn't be surprised if they were trying to stretch out the episodes. Episode 6 was the best one and had some of the show's best acting.The last 3 episodes were really bad and uninspired and clearly just meant to setup a season 2 which is annoying. All the character arcs are thrown out the window, a police officer investigating this deadly game has a lackluster ending, and the reveals.... meh? The 'protagonist' learns nothing by the end of the film, so there's zero character arc.I'll give it a 6. It's entertaining to watch the games and their thought process but I can't give it anymore than that thanks to the lackluster ending. Now an ending can be disappointing but I want rate an entire series on JUST an ending (like Game of Thrones). But the fact this did nothing new at all and flat out copied movies. People are saying some of the above movies I mentioned are fantasy, but there's another movie I can't think of where people volunteer to play for money in a very realistic setting that is basically the same thing...Nothing new, acting is OKAY, some major plotholes or scratch your head moments, and not a good conclusion. I know they're setting up for season 2, but how they set it up is pretty stupid. And I don't think it needs to go there to begin with."
600,Squid Game,"So good to see a truly entertaining TV show for a change, enjoyed every single episode, a big round of applause for Korean entertainment. And don't worry about the bad VIPs, they're not in it for long and the masks are beautiful."
601,Squid Game,"Gripping South Korean take on a Battle Royale theme, based around playing games for a huge cash prize. The Aesthetics are memorable & the competition relentless. Kudos to Netflix for taking such original regional content on. Its like nothing I have seen before."
602,Squid Game,"This show is incredible and sad at the same time because it shows us human nature in a world dominated by the value of money, how far we can go by having money on one side and how sick those who have money are, in short we are doomed for money."
603,Squid Game,"Takes the battle royale Hunger games style approach coupled with high stakes children's style games and creates an intriguing story of debt and greed. Shows how people can change when they are pushed so far. You will end up loving and hating characters, and be surprised at the plot twists. This is one of my new favorite shows. I hope Season 2 is as good or better than the first."
604,Squid Game,"I do love Korean music, movies and series. So I'm overwhelmed and happy that Squid Game gets so much hype and is currently the most streamed series on Netflix. I've seen Ig Stories of my friends loving Squid Game. Even though they never watched Korean series or films before.I grant all the success from heart to Hwang Dong-hyuk. His plot for the series was rejected many times over the years by a lot of companies. They didn't believed in Squid Game.What I live about Squid Game is that it deals with pain & desperation. It shows what people are willing to do to get money.The actors were impressive during the entire season. Also recognized some familiar faces.The plot is not predictable and never lost it magic. I was there from the first to the last second fully focused on the screen.Squid Game & Move To Heaven are the best series on Netflix.10/10."
605,Squid Game,"First of all. I like Korean cinema. Memories of murder and Burning are among my top 10 favorite films of all time.The show has been hyped everywhere and I actually didn't want to see it right away. But so many people told me to watch. So I watched.I try to make it simple and I don't make it up.I knew the guy in the black mask was the brother of the police guy from the 3rd episode on. Why would the black masked guy be the only one with a weird voice.I knew right away that the old guy has something to do with the whole thing. It came to my mind instantly. He was the only old guy and kind of wise and all and also in the marble game episode he was the only character not being shown being shot.Yes it was thrilling here and there, yes the performances were good and yes I wanted to keep watching. But to me it was pretty predictable.Every character did exactly what I expected in almost every situation. The bad guy with the snake tattoo just kept being an idiot. The crazy woman he slept with yep being annoying and loud. And so on.And this goes along with every thing in the show.Examples:Marble game again. There is this husband guy who kind of killed his wife who wants to hang himself. He hangs himself. Success. It would've been funnier if it didn't work and he had to keep playing. Even though I know he wasn't an important character.The glass bridge game. The broker guy who also fooled Ali pushes one person into death right in front of the last step to safety. He pushes the guy, the guy falls down and dies. He jumps and wins. I would've loved that at one point maybe two of the glass surfaces were to be the weaker ones. That would've been unexpected. He pushes the guy and thinks he's safe, jumps, but the other one breaks too. WOW. Didn't happen.Police guy trying to escape all the sudden. Why so ever. He looked for his brother, couldn't find him and then leaves. They look after him in the weird tunnel in the cupboard. They follow him. They see that one oxygen divers tank is missing so they assume he went diving. And what did he do ? He went diving. I would've like that he had maybe hidden one tank somewhere to fool them. Didn't happen.The whole show is just based on its whole premise. Violence and shock. And bright classic music in weird situations. And that just repeats.To me it really went difficult when the 'VIPs' showed up. They were super cringeworthy. I couldn't barely watch and listen to their generic lines. And why would they come to almost the last game ? So they watched people running over a bridge and two guys fighting on a rainy playground. Wow. They should've been introduced earlier. They weren't even needed at all. If you'd take them out it wouldn't have changed anything and it would've even be more mysterious in my opinion. I doesn't match with what the old guy says in the end and it is also not further explained.And then the show ends with a father not going to see his daughter. Instead coloring his hair red and apparently wants to play again. Instead of going to see his daughter and make it up again. Right.. Who cares about children. She can wait another year. Stoopid kid.I also had a problem with the portrayal of the Arab character. He was portrayed as super stupid, almost retarded. He didn't even know what even and odd numbers are. And his name was Ali Abdul. It's like having a French character and calling him 'Guy Frenchman'.However it was still a lot better than 80% of Netflix stuff. And I will watch the second season if it comes. I also liked ""Sweet Home"" which is also a Korean show with monsters and all around one house. It kind of went nowhere in the end, but I actually liked that one more."
606,Squid Game,"It wasn't actually bad,but just like any netflix show
It's never good enough/great
It's mostly an overhyped show that's (at best cases) A time killer
So scenes were really long that you don't lose anything by skipping a minute or two
Some actors were really really horrible
Edgy and like anime characters
A bully is 24/7 a criminal/bully
A woman who uses people is 24/7 this way
And if there's a game that's based on people fighting to keep the bet on,why would they let them kill each other?And the whole brother murder thing is really dumb..and somr plots are dumb like a couple coming back again and being surprised they'll kill each other while it's supposed to happen at one point or the other,and people repeating that they'll get out together while the rule was you can't get out together and keep the money...and the VIPs arc was waaayyyy too dumb."
607,Squid Game,"I really loved the first few episodes, but soon the magic started waning for me. There were too many predictable and pointless subplots, and the level of melodrama started to get too high for my taste. Also, there were a couple of outrageously homophobic moments.All in all; the show was good and I enjoyed it, but expected something more based on all the hype."
608,Squid Game,Korean shows movies are the best no doubt...some are getting a bit too much Hollywood in em is getting scary...bit slow compared to Alice in borderlands...indian guy is making this ugly with overacting and bending down unnaturally as if he's gonna fall down... multiculturalism is ok but avoid these guys in good natural Korean shows and movies...they make it like Bollywood crap...rest is good.
609,Squid Game,"...just because the violence, blood and gore were too gratuitous for my taste. But the story was so intriguing yet disturbing we just couldn't stop watching. Looking forward to Season 2 even though I'll hide my eyes for lots of it."
610,Squid Game,"It's one of the best series I have seen in my life
The VIPs give some boring scenes to the show
But it still the show is 100% worth watching
If you have a good heart
I watched it in 1 day."
611,Squid Game,"Just binge the whole 9 episodes
And I will probably say it is one of the best series you will look after
The VIPs give some boring scenes to the show
But the show is still 100%worth
If you have already watched Parasite and loved it this series is for you
I will not recommend you this series in only one condition if you don't have a powerful heart."
612,Squid Game,"Incredible story and performances layered over a timely, universal theme about the dangerously increasing wealth gap. Excellent visuals (I imagine black/pink soldier costumes will be popular) and character development. May develop trust issues after watching."
613,Squid Game,"""Squid Game"" is a show meant to appeal to its viewers twisted inner child. It's not just the games themselves, but the brightly coloured, oversize playground in which the players are forced to live and compete. The storytelling is relatively simple and straightforward. And the satirical elements about the evil billionaires who come to bet on the game can at times feel like how a grade schooler."
614,Squid Game,"This series is extremely good, the character I love the most in it have to be player 1. My rating 8/10."
615,Squid Game,"Yea sorry alert from those ( who I think may have struggled due to language and culture barriers so nobody's fault really ) the series was one of the best things I've been seen . I'm pooped I watch it in two days and I need a holiday . I like to think I cry at things when it's needed but I'm either going though something subconsciously right now or this series just got me ... got me bad... I blubbered at without a doubt the most heartbreaking episode ( 6) I've ever witnessed from a show . I was a mess .... literal snot everywhere and sobbing noises which concluded at the end of the dining episode .. anyways I'm off to chill coz I'm shredded and need to be ok for a wedding this week. Bravo actors , writers , directors and everyone else it was a triumphal . Bravo."
616,Squid Game,"Decent show, good acting and cast, definitely best K-drama I've ever seen, I would probably never rewatch it but it isn't necessarily bad, it is definitely overrated though, I liked the violence and gore, also unlike most K dramas the plot doesn't seem like it was put together in a day and the movie doesn't look like it was filmed by a teenager with an old camera that they found in their basement, also the editing/green screen is a lot better than expected, and most of the actors are hot so they made it easy to watch hahahah.. Also it isn't too long, nor is it too short, which is good because I can't watch things for a prolonged amount of time."
617,Squid Game,I have seen Battle Royale and all the Hunger Games. So I see the comparison to those well constructed films. But this film's characters have the emotional and mental capacity of teenagers.If it were teens it may have been more believable. Every plot point was predictable to a point I was yelling at the tv and the actors performances for many scenes was overdone. It was way too long for such a simple idea that has already been done before and much better in other films.And most every character is un likable. Even the main one is so lost 90% of the time that you lose interest in his redemption.
618,Squid Game,"Squid Games received a lot of buzz since it came out and it is easy to understand why. Around 400 people who have their own financial problems decide to join a tournament, in which they have to play kids games where the losers will be killed. The premise is similar to franchises such as the hunger games, and other violent movies that became popular after that franchise.And throughout the first couple of episodes we get kind of the same adrenaline filled experiences: the games are silly but due to the fact you get killed when you loose there is automatically tension. And eventhough it is pretty clear who will survive the first few games, audience still get what they want; a high body count and enough gore.When the stakes are getting higher, you start to realize that the show has more similarities to 'the most dangerous game' and 'The Cabin in the Woods'. And without going too much into spoilers, the power distance between certain characters is present in all these three names. And soon you start to realize that it is a bold move for an American company (Netflix) to produce such anti-American series. I just wish they stocked with this idea.Unfortunately, and maybe I am a bit too harsh in ranking it this low because of this, they completely flipped the premise on his head towards the end. And everything they build up in the previous episodes is wasted by a cheap plot twist that literally does not make sense at all. Don't get me wrong, the games are fun and there is plenty of tension, but it doesn't add up like The Cabin in The woods ended. The anti American propaganda is completely thrown out, and that is a huge dissapointment.Pros: the games, the violence, references to inequality
Cons: plot twist, predictability, ending."
619,Squid Game,"It took a minute to get started but once it did, I was hooked. With than being said, the winner pissed me off. He was so moral that he oozed of stupidity. Him winning was an insult to all those who fought and lost and died. He indulged in a year long, self absorbed pity party. Had I saw the ending first, I wouldn't have bothered watching any of it."
620,Squid Game,"Series lost its thrill after 5th Episode
Just an average show."
621,Squid Game,"If you're looking for the stereotypical K-Drama with romance, no cussing, nudity, sex, or gore, DO NOT watch this. Netflix has absolutely smashed the Korean television stereotype out of the park - in a good way. The twists and shock that this series has is mind-bending. It will have your jaw on the floor after each episode. I'd say my only gripe is the open ending. I know 99% of K-Dramas don't get a second season, but I REALLY hope for a continuation with this one."
622,Squid Game,"After the relentless hype, gave it a try but after one episode got bored.Its production is stylish, well acted but the premise is too unrealistic, ok even if you buy the fact that somehow a group can organise such murderous games, if it had an ounce of realism, after the massacre of the first game, 90% of the survivors would be too shocked and ptsd to talk never mind vote onto whether continue or not, and then ofc the vote is dead heat and down to last vote. Poor poor writing.Gave up end of 2nd episode.Just shows world we live in now, hype over quality."
623,Squid Game,"Probably one of the most cliché, ""battle royale"" kind of storyline... BUT... It was still very gripping, intense, and entertaining. Definitely a binge worthy show! I can really see the typical K-drama elements in this show - you know, the unnecessary and far-fetched plot twist that almost makes you feel like it's trying to make up for something? Yeah, that. I could probably list all the cliché and predictable moments in this show but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.However, I can't deny the fact that this really did get me binge watching for 2 days. Perhaps, it's the great acting or the overly indulgent storyline - I'm not sure but I was hooked."
624,Squid Game,"Personally found it to be somewhat of a combination of Saw, Hunger Games and Parasite, though very original in its own way.A great new TV show to binge (but maybe not with the family)"
625,Squid Game,"This is a must-watch series . It's very unique and it had me at the edge of my bed right throughout the season. The ending was not expected, but it was very interesting and I can't wait for season 2."
626,Squid Game,"If you haven't seen Korean movies or shows before hand, you will blown away from this show. Squid Games is well crafted to be enjoyable to what show about human demons and family. The end was predictable (as I have seen other Korean films and shows), something won't be right, there is no happy end at no cost. This was good show compared to any poor attempt to create anything original (*cough cough American shows ). I hope this cultural exchange will help the viewers to see other types of screen play and to learn to distinguish the good from the absolute trash."
627,Squid Game,"The acting in Squid Game is phenomenal. I've seen so many negative reviews based on the acting of the VIPS - in which you BARELY even see. It's the typical rich people acting - is it worth an Oscar... no, but the acting from the Korean cast is worthy of awards no doubt.Squid Game is a fun, fast paced ride I would take again. Highly recommend!"
628,Squid Game,I don't know what to say except this series is perfection. It's original and it draws you in if you give it a chance.
629,Squid Game,Not original at all but refreshing to see this theme played by good Corean actors.Apparently the gender and bla agenda is not a must for Corean series. Which is fine by me.
630,Squid Game,I must say i'm a big fan of kdram since childhood . And this is another level of kdrama.
631,Squid Game,The first episode is absolutely ridiculous and enjoyable but this is so horribly filmed. People that are shot for red light greenlight didn't move and those that did didn't get shot. If your gonna make the game high stakes at least FILM the correct actors/extras.
632,Squid Game,DefinitelyThe director is a fan of Playstation.>.<
633,Squid Game,What is it with Japanese and Korean Culture ....they love torture and humiliation.Like their game shows there is always an element of sadistic danger...look how they treated prisoners of war...
634,Squid Game,"Unlike some other comments, this is LIKE other things I've already seen or heard of. It's a built on a bunch of different already used ideas, and put together into a smart package that pleases the directed target group (which is basically everyone), which was *told* to watch and enjoy this show. Marketing wise these creators hit the jackpot and the hype train is real.Almost any fast going series can get really captivating and easy to binge nowadays, and the only thing original is that this one got to the extreme when it comes to exposure and word-of-mouth.I'm not saying it's a bad series but when the hype is over and people might reflect again it will probably be viewed as the 6 to 7 rated series that it is. Those who can recite the happenings in the series a month after watching it are welcome to prove me wrong though."
635,Squid Game,"Interesting concept but I just don't get why many of the (adult) characters in the Corean shows/movies I've seen act like one-dimensional, overdramatic, yelling twelve year olds? It makes it hard to take the story seriously and even more difficult to empathize with most of the characters.It's a cultural thing I guess but It's hard to get used to or appreciate.HoYeon Jung is an amazing actress though!"
636,Squid Game,"Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the ""kids games"" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people. As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show."
637,Squid Game,"This programme will be dividing viewers opinions the works over, but in my humble one, it is outstanding.A concept that has been done before but never with this level of death and destruction as far as I can Recall.Some of the best drama is coming from overseas currently and we must not forget that every country has brilliant story tellers and filmmakers.If you are watching this in English language then some of the dubbed dialogue will appear awkward and crass but overall it all comes together to make compelling viewing but a few great plot twists within.Maybe this is a one-off series but I feel the door has been left open just enough to bring it back should someone like Netflix decide to pour in more cash. But maybe we do not need another series..."
638,Squid Game,Seong is going to the squid game again with his red hair but already has his money won for the first time but after losing all of his friends and his brother he blames himself because the death of her mother will he's gonna make it again.
639,Squid Game,"The Chinese/Korean actors and actresses are absolutely amazing! They make everything just feel so real and believable, yes the English voice acting is a bit off but please believe me when I say there are shows with MUUUCH worse voice acting. Watched the entire season in 1 day and WOW what a emotional Rollercoaster filled with thrills and connections to the characters! Awesome Awesome Awesome show."
640,Squid Game,"Positives:
The concept of Koreans competes in dangerous children's games to win money is original and interesting.Gi-Hun's ironic smile.Honeycomb is my favorite game in Squid Game, front of Red Light, Green Light and Marbles.The ending is ""To be continued..."" and I can't wait for Season 2.The fight of Gi-Hun and Sang-Woo is amazing.Fly Me to the Moon is beautifully great.Likeable characters, except the VIPs
The old man smiles during the games, and epic twist that he's the host of the games.I loved the soundtrack, such as Way Back Then, Pink Soldiers, Unfolded..., and Needles and Dalgona.Negatives:
The V. I. Ps are weird and unlikeable.Deok-Su is mean-spirted and a selfish man.Fantastic series (100/100) (I can't wait for Season 2 where Gi-Huns gets revenge on the games)"
641,Squid Game,"I adored this show, the colour theme was absolutely phenomenal and so aesthetic YET terrifying, however... the VIP's could not act, but i'm not going to let the VIP's spoil the entire show."
642,Squid Game,The poor and the actors are very realistic however the vips ruined everything with the terrible acting.
643,Squid Game,This is the best thriller which I have seen till now.Vera level entertainmentStarting to end full entertainment and suspense.Netflix proves its best.Waiting for next season.
644,Squid Game,"Squid game is a well-crafted show engineered to appeal to western audience. All the tropes of a running series are found here. The royalty-free music placed near the end of the episode to make you reflect, the constant cliff hangers (which are archaic in the age of binge watching), and the excessive - and I mean EXCESSIVE - investment in character backstory and development. This last trope is particularly obnoxious.At least five episodes are dedicated to the development of characters or establishing their backstory. The growth of the characters are so slow, repetitive and saturating that it makes it hard to become invested in them. It is ironic that you feel more for the lesser characters than for the primary characters.Another point of contention are the games and where they take place. There is such a thing as inspiration, but there is also such a thing as theft. This show borrows inspiration from previous Battle Royale style works (see As the Gods Will it and Alice in Borderland). However, what it borrows in inspiration from one work, it blatantly steals from another. Those who have watched Battle Royale would be able to tell just how blatantly lifted one of its unique concepts is during one pivotal scene in the series. This is not excusable.What is also inexcusable are the actors who portrayed the VIPs. Calling the acting atrocious is a compliment. Their acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like an Oscar contender.The lukewarm observations of ethics, morality and the human condition would appeal to teenagers or forum philosophers, but to the seasoned viewers who have either watched Korean cinema or Battle Royale movies it is as run of the mill as it gets."
645,Squid Game,"The film has an interesting and, of course, sensational story in a way that provokes humans to follow the series, which shows how human beings are willing to play even with their own lives like movies because of economic poverty. In the film, players have weaknesses that can be realized by looking closely at the film. The film is made in an attractive atmosphere and its writing group has acted strongly. In general, the film is fascinating and, of course, new, but one should not expect much from its acting ensemble, The film has an interesting and, of course, sensational story in a way that provokes humans to follow the series, which shows how human beings are willing to play even with their own lives like movies because of economic poverty.

In the whole film, it is fascinating and, of course, new, but one should not expect much from its acting ensemble."
646,Squid Game,"Only a sociopath will like watching something like this. The show has very negative energy and it affects the audience. If you don't realise that I'm sorry for you. I love thrillers and horror movies if they have a point in them. This is too much because there are literally so many people living in debt especially now during COVID and the suicide rates have skyrocketed because of it. This is not funny, nor interesting, nor enjoyable to watch!"
647,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the ""twist"" ending was predictable as I'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the ""intruder"" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.P. S. Would you play?"
648,Squid Game,"Fantastically haunting soundtrack.Rich character development that leads to you having a connection with all of the lead roles.Iconic costumes and a horrifying and thought provoking plot.This should would have gotten a 10 of if wasnt for episodes 7 and 9.(SPOILER ALERT)
X - episode 7 - the VIP's were absolutely horribly cast and they needed a stronger script. I completely understand what they were trying to achieve but literally every line that came out of any of their mouths was cringe worthy in delivery. It took away from an otherwise outstanding episode.X - episode 9 - Everyone loved the relationship of old mate and the lead character. The final ep really took away from that connection. I am a fan of twists but this one just didnt seem believable for me. The character was just too different to be credible.X - red hair was pointless
X - Not getting on the plane felt like a stretch from the leads character. Lets just hope he doesnt go full John Wick in season 2 or its just too far from everything that was great in 7 of the 9 eps.Its hard to give above an 8 when the vips and old mate twist was just one cringe too far."
649,Squid Game,"I came late into watching Squid Games since I knew I needed to have my head in the ""game"".First episode is a great introduction of the main character and how brutal the games are. But, even now brutal the games are portrait I had a worse feeling in my body watching episode 2 with the appropriate title ""Hell"".These first two episodes tell you more or less all you need to know about the main cast to establish a relationship with them and there own problems, creating a greater understanding.The show has a few side stories that I kinda didn't care that much about and seems like padding more than anything else and didn't really seem to pan out anything in the show.For the last episode I like it up until the last few minutes where I had a: ""Oh no! They are gonna make a season 2!?!"" and a few searches online affirmed my feelings. I don't mind a new season, but I'd rather they rounded of this story and then just made a new one for season 2, but you know, gotta have them cliffhangers.Good show, a kinda unsatisfying end."
650,Squid Game,"Could barely get through the first 30 mins of this. Extremely boring, cheesy, unstimulating,... I kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on... a lot of over acting. I do not understand what the hype is all about."
651,Squid Game,The people's bar hit that low ? People who whatched real thrills they really think that is enjoyable!? Or it is all about the tik tok generation. The public tatste tendency is horrifying.
652,Squid Game,"Watching Squid Game makes me think about a lesser known horror movie ""Would you Rather"". Same concept of people participating on a game for money and ends up all being dead except the main character who goes home with the money but with a dead loved one. Acting is pretty good, as well as the effects, but the plot was predictable right after they came back to the game. The MC's actions feels unrealistic, suddenly making an enemy out of his friend after he actually just barely saved all of them at the stepping stones. He also didn't do anything about his daughter who was the whole point of him joining the game. The police man intruder sub plot feels more like a filler since it doesn't do anything about the actual plot, it could have been entirely erased from the story and won't change anything about the outcome. Even the old man twist at the end doesn't really do much about everything. Overall, still pretty watchable and a nice way to kill some time during Pandemic. Hopefully, if Season 2 does come, they could connect all those plot holes and make it work."
653,Squid Game,"I was so hyped to watch this because everywhere I went, people were talking about it. My expectations were set high by the internet community, but the internet community often doesn't know anything. This was mediocre, 6* show, but I'm giving it 2*, because of all the people that gave it 10*. I was so disappointed when it ended, because they never explained anything."
654,Squid Game,"I just cannot grasp why people rate this over 5 points. Really. If it dosent take more than something like this to get great rating, the quality perception has really deteriorated during the pandemic."
655,Squid Game,"The brand new hype series of the season. Is it any good? With so many commenting about it and the massive number of positive reviews on this website, I dare ask the question everybody feels so confronted when asked: why? If you have seen the show and enjoyed it, please take a minute to consider the reasons for that. I feel like ""Squid Game"" has been given too much credit, and I will try to explain why without spoiling for those who still consider watching it.A few users on IMDb have already pointed out many incongruities in the story, unresolved plot points, character inconsistencies, unexplained details and while all of it is valid criticism, I could easily nitpick any number of flaws with the story, dialogue and characters, and not make a point. Aside from the fact that I don't want to spoil the series, I think it's more important to highlight the general idea of the show and why most plot holes, from small to gigantic, were a problem, instead of just listing them.To begin with, the premise is preposterous and nobody would think that to be feasible, therefore it's unreasonable to criticize the show for being unrealistic. We take what is given to us and suspend our disbelief until further notice. And that's where the issues begin. I can happily ignore certain details about HOW all of it came to be, if those details are never mentioned again. However, ""Squid Game"" takes an approach to its story that confronts the whole idea of its premise, setting it against rational inquiry of the facts shown to us. Simply put, its an absurd story trying to be realistic. Is that a problem? Not necessarily. Take ""The Platform"" for example: The absurd premise is justified by the bigger picture, a metaphor. ""The Platform"" doesn't dwell on the details of HOW it all came to be, or WHO is behind all of it. It doesn't matter, because the narrative structure only serves as a parallel between our's and the movie's reality. Then how does ""The Platform"" differ from ""Squid Game""? In favor of reliable (read: cliché) plot conflicts, the metaphor aspect comes crashing down in ""Squid Game"". For example, when the masked game enforcers are shown as human, it naturally begs the question: HOW did those people end up there? Now these characters are not an idea anymore, they are people, and people need stories. And guess what? They never get one.That problem repeats itself a number of times, most notably with the main characters' decisions, as they repeatedly take actions that are not in accordance with their already established characteristics. When they break character, it is in favor of a simple and predictable resolution to the problem faced. If they were to act accordingly to themselves, the story wouldn't go the authors' way. That would create conflicts the writers wouldn't know how to solve, therefore they end up relying on clichés to save themselves from that trouble.The way I see it, a story like this should have taken one of 3 approaches: realistic, fantastical or metaphorical.As a metaphor, ""Squid Game"" could've worked not unlike the aforementioned ""The Platform"", drawing parallels with the elements of the show and our reality.As a fantasy series, it could have gone down the same path as ""Alice in Borderland"". The realism wouldn't matter then and the mystery would be stronger.As a realistic show we would have something like ""Saló or 120 days of Sodom"". And it should've felt just as disturbing, after all, both stories are about powerful people playing with the lives of unfortunate souls. But that doesn't seem the point ""Squid Game"" wants to make, after all it puts us in the same place of the evil powerful men in masks: sitting comfortably in our sofas, relishing in the spectacle of violence, anguish and pain. But hey, that could be the point the show is making, right? You are just as bad as those evil men! You are enjoying this show too! But no, ""Squid Game"" doesn't confront you with that notion, like Michael Haneke did with ""Funny Games"". You are to mindlessly enjoy the carnage and ask no further questions. Are you satisfied? Don't worry about answering that. Keep yourself busy. Watch another episode before you have time to ask yourself another silly question."
656,Squid Game,"Few TV shows episodes have had the same effect for me as Squid Game's first episode, especially when the game starts, for real. Shocking, in every way. On par with GoT premiere and some 9th episodes.Another highlight is episode 6, Ggangu. It left me in tears, gasping for breath.And the finale wraps things up in an unexpected way. Bravo!I try to sum up some of the great stuff of the show:
Lovable main character - such a refreshing contrast to hollywood heroesGreat, multifaceted characters overall, whether they are bad or good.Characters don't look like supermodels, but like average people. Well, except one, but she is phenomenal tooGreat acting, and overacting - but fun, and touchingColours, details - everything pops out in a 4k glory4k gory, did I say. It makes your stomach churn.Cinematics - beautifully shot, awesome visuals.Practical sets and special effects, which are fantastic.The clothes, masks, hoods - where can I buy those?Music. Haunting score, memorable tunes.Writing, plot, excitement.Cliffhanger endings on episodes.There are messages about the modern world, makes you think about humanityIts not a kids' show. But grown ups, go for it."
657,Squid Game,"Squid game is not just about some kind of life and death game thriller. It is way way more than that. Unmasking human, and some masked people are doing this, the irony is too good and on point. Strong performances and fast paced script make it more intriguing. One of the finest K dramas ever. Eagerly waiting for season 2."
658,Squid Game,"I was so intrigued to finally watch this and I managed to avoid spoilers. (Just a heads up this review and my opinions will contain spoilers so please steer clear if you want to avoid them yourself.)The whole concept of this series was pretty damn cool and very compelling. The sets, cinematography, music and character designs as well as their back stories were thought out and exceptionally done. Really amazing.The acting was all really good except for the VIPs... I was looking forward to meeting them so much; who they were and what their experience and involvement was but when they were introduced I feel that the series started to fall apart. There was an immersion that was broken upon their introductions and they didn't really serve any purpose either.All of the games and the main content of this show were really well done but the final three episodes really lost me. I wasn't as interested and the way it ended felt off to me. It wasn't a good wrap up at all. This was disappointing because the first five episodes were really edge of your seat kind of viewing."
659,Squid Game,Gratuitous violence. And we wonder why the world is in the state it is in. Trivializing atrocity by juxtaposing callous murder with cheerful music. Sick.
660,Squid Game,"And all of this about some paper??? (and I'm not talking about the deforestation...or am I?)I mean..there's nothing human left in humanity, isn't it? We all know the answer but it's still deeply disturbing and saddening.Well, they tried to give us hope and even though there's no reason to, I'm not ready to give up on that...yet.The fact that I cried for that old guy; what more can I say?!FUN?! WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN???I remembered smth from ""Crash"" which fits perfectly here""It's the sense of touch. (...) We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something.""And there's that about social classes, hierarchy, capitalism, religion, nature vs. Nurture, immigration, suicide, love, blah-blahThe show is brilliant!"
661,Squid Game,"Even though I have Netflix, I only watch when I see a trailer on a social media platform I use. What got me hooked was the simple fact when granny used her bank pin as her grand daughter's birthday, I KNEW I HAD to watch. 6.8 baby here & plus I'm part Korean."
662,Squid Game,"OK yes, the VIP acting was atrociously bad and at the end it got a bit predictable. But other than that this is a masterfully crafted drama by filmmakers who damn well know how to create tension and suspense. I was worried that the ""game"" would turn into a gimmick, but it works so so so well! The acting is also phenomenal, the main characters are portrayed so viscerally human and the ""game"" acts to enrich these characters while making us feel all the thrills! Its damn great stuff!TL;DR: Incredible film making, suspense, tension, great characters and horrible VIP'sLooking forward to Season 2 (if there is one :) !!"
663,Squid Game,"The story is far from original. You have seen it all back in Battle Royale, Hunger Games and maybe dozens of other kill to survive genre movies. However, this one has Korean Cinema stylishness, great cinematography, good directing and acting. Story and characters lack logic most of the time so just enjoy the colorful and gore world of Squid Game. Do not expect flawless story or deep social messages or grand philosophy because there is none."
664,Squid Game,"My goodness...this show brilliantly took me down a path of horrors. Each episode digging deeper into terrible situations. And just when you think things can't get much worse, they do. But I loved nearly every second of it. Warning: One of the episodes definitely gave my girlfriend an anxiety attack."
665,Squid Game,"This is the proof people are still fans of predictable stories. If this is the 2021 most mainstream TV series, something is definitely off. Except for a few moments and interesting parts when they participate in the game, everything else is filled with already seen stuff. Main character's morality is selectable/clashing in different situations, ridiculous plot twists and most of all, acting and dialogue of ""rich people watching"" is major cringe. I would avoid this, except if you really want to see why is this so popular."
666,Squid Game,"Could not relate to the story or any of the characters. Just didn't even care who lives, who dies. Loopholes in the story galore. Unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. In the end was like *yawn* whatever. No issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. This felt like it is riding on the wave movies like Parasite created for Korean cinema/TV. Bloated overhyped nonsense at best. Give it a skip and save your time."
667,Squid Game,"I have to agree that the VIPs are the weakest point to the show, but they hardly ruin it. Don't let the criticism towards them stop you from watching what may be the best miniseries I've ever seen.I look forward to watching this again."
668,Squid Game,"Honestly wow - from the first episode I sat wide mouthed, what am I watching and why - I didn't care.This series is amazing, it's brutal, it made me cry - what a watch.Suddenly you don't care about the subtitles, they pale into nothing, they don't matter - you find yourself watching this, reading effortlessly.An amazing series, thank you!"
669,Squid Game,"I knew this will be amazing on first look of it, I watched it as soon as it got out on netflix, it is briliant and it deseves all love that is getting."
670,Squid Game,"Which I guess includes me; after all, I did watch all 8 1/2 episodes with no one exactly aiming a gun at my head. But I did fast-forward through the most ridiculous parts, so.Tragically enough, I sense a degree of genius involvement somewhere along the line, probably at the very start of the Squid project. A writer with a vision and actual talent, ordered by some meathead producer to make the whole thing as vile and watchable as, say, the first instalment of Saw, and the writer (whom in this case, also got to direct it) did it so his or her family could eat. Or at least that's the take I can live with. But anyway: don't even get me started on the way Netflix treats their talent. I imagine their top execs are just like those revolting VIPs, more than capable of watching people die for fun.Such a shame that this Netflix fodder will be remembered as the Korean finest, while the real good - not Netflix - stuff, like Kingdom and Train to Busan, will most likely get buried under a relentless pile of total squid."
671,Squid Game,"This show was incredible. Cinematography and script. -2 points because of the incredibly unlikeable, mostly pathetic main actor that is all in all acted like a terrible person to his family but not to everyone else. I didn't understand his motivation sometimes and he got quite annoying. The acting of the VIPs was a bit bizarre too."
672,Squid Game,"I don't really understand the point of the cop subplot... Otherwise I had a blast watching this show, loved the cinematography, and the main actor is great."
673,Squid Game,"Let me begin by saying if you're squimish about blood and guts, do not watch this series. There's a good story line to follow but I found it a bit excessive when it came to blood but being a horror fan, I was able to deal with this part of the series. On the whole, the series is a study in human behavior especially under critical conditions and I'm sure this show will be a required study in all psychology classes. IMO, I feel as though the writers were paying homage to Stanley Kubrick and his portfolio of work. See if you can see the similarities as you get deeper into the story line. There are 9 episodes which last about an hour and one that's about 30 minutes long. There's been much talk about it on social media and that's given it a boost in viewership but all in all it kept my attention enough to see how it was going to end. I gave it an 8 since it drew me into watching the whole series...."
674,Squid Game,"This is a masterful blend of elements of fantasy, psychological thriller, character development, personal journal- a refreshing example of superbly crafted storyline's. At last!! A decent , fresh program on Netflix!This Korean series is addictive, superbly cast, cleverly directed & beautifully production designed. The editing is gripping.The sound effects are nail biting. We loved it.5 stars to all the lead actors.Cannot wait for the series 2.But please, please, please- don't extend forever into series 6,7, 8...etc, etc, like some of the other substandard Hollywood shows that Netflix has commissioned before."
675,Squid Game,"There is a lot of gore, of course, and you will definitely cry at some point of the show, probably twice at least. Still, it's a fantastic show that I highly recommend watching (not with the English dub though, because it sounds very goofy)."
676,Squid Game,"The concept of the show is very unique and it was really interesting. But the show was really slow paced. So, if you don't have the patience you might even quit. Acting was good except the few VIPs whose acting were horrible. The show makes you emotional towards various characters."
677,Squid Game,"Games with deaths, friendships, betrayal- we're not new with these stories. The idea of the story is interesting, but not interesting enough to make all these hypes about it. A very overrated and over-hyped show."
678,Squid Game,"Scenario is okey,actings is okey and offcourse big budget netflix serie but deserves max to be 7 point who watches real good tv series fans. Just okey and nothing special and the worst part mostly when you watch netflix production you see only production in series not orijinal something.again exaggerated one more serie like la casa della papel."
679,Squid Game,Superb series mind-blowing suspense thriller novel drama all mixed.
680,Squid Game,"It starts very weird as the concept is quite abstract, the violence is sudden and spectacular and some of the acting is very OTT. However, the story is intriguing enough to keep you going and around the middle of the series it really finds its stride. One particular episode is truly heartbreaking and superbly well-shot and acted. Unfortunately, in a needless desire to force a 'shocking twist' into the ending, they up completely undermining that best episode in the show. It really left a sour taste at the end before the final episode just drifts on a bit and ends without much more happening.Overall, glad I watched it but felt the last episode was a enormous let-down."
681,Squid Game,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this show.I found the story to be quite slow and boring, mainly when they aren't competing. Do the games catch your attention? Sure. But it isn't anything to write home about."
682,Squid Game,"The games and story is a crazy one. Surprised they pulled this off during covid but of course it's korean drama. They are at the top of their game. Very gorey, heads up."
683,Squid Game,"I'll give this series a high 6. A lot of clichés and familiar tropes collide here. I would definitely watch another series if it were offered though, as there are many avenues for this to go. If you're young, or don't watch a lot of movies/series, the hype is for you. Enjoy."
684,Squid Game,"Best thing I've seen on Netflix in months. The way that the games are set up is what makes this good. I just would rather be shot in the head instead of playing this....
Tug of War and that Glass game is brutal! Almost cried during the Marble game. And the two most irritating players plunged to their death at the same time. I was on my couch cheering!Check it out."
685,Squid Game,"Im soo glad i watched this before all the hype started because shows are always ruined by hype and spoilers. Being completely new to korean telly, i was shockingly surprised by the story line, the drama, the acting, the cinematics and the entire shabang! Its the best series i have seen in a very very long time but i do feel it will be a one hit wonder. A season 2 just wont be able to match up to the buzz & excitement surrounding Season 1."
686,Squid Game,"U got to give it to the Koreans. They know what art is and how to present it. I was hooked from beginning to end. A quite original production with lots of memorable scenes that we will remember for years to come. I cant give 10 stars because i disagree with the ending, but that doesnt change the fact that i stepped on a diamond."
687,Squid Game,"Great show with surprising end but with the fear of a second, everything destroying second season due to the open last part of the show."
688,Squid Game,"This show drags. I beg of you to skip episode two altogether.We're here to watch the people play the games and die. I don't care about all of these absolute whiny little girls and their annoying problems.I'll admit, I'm watching with English dubs. It's just like anime. It sounds over-acted and annoying. All the women in this show sounds beyond annoying.This show shines when it focuses on the games and the storytelling slightly before and after the games. Everything else is drawn out. I wonder if it's because it's a tv show. A movie would have gotten all of this out of the way and then play ball!There are some great diamonds hidden under an abundance of rocks. If you can hold out, then you can enjoy some great scenes. If you have zero patience though, do yourself a favour and hope they make a movie version."
689,Squid Game,This Is Wonderful and Best Webseries Forever. It has Also Season 2. It is available on all Languages. This Type of webseries Never before Ever after. It has Mind Blocking Twists.
690,Squid Game,"I truly enjoyed this show from the beginning but eventually less and less when people started comparing it to some of the greats.Squid Game is meaningful and has a strong message against capitalism but what people fail to see somehow its a rip off of Alice in borderland..In a nutshell, You will enjoy watching this but don't let the hype get to you."
691,Squid Game,I've just finished watching this and I still need to process what is just went through. This show is very different than anything on TV these days.The script is very extreme and the story makes you think how would you act in such situations.I loved the characters.
692,Squid Game,"Loved this series and how it kept me hooked until the very end. The very last game and conclusion were rather mediocre and was a cheap method at opening up the doors to a Season 2, but everything up until that point were a clear 9/10.If you love competitive death game/escape room movies/shows, this is one you should not pass on."
693,Squid Game,"First of all, I only saw one episode, and only because this series is now all the rage, apparantly. I don't see the appeal.Right off the bat, I felt the protagonist was very tropy and annoying. Why was it necessary to depict him as a pathological gambler? Not a lot of people can relate to that, but almost everyone knows what it's like to be broke (which is what drove him to enter the game, so he wouldn't lose his daughter). Why doesn't the show have the courage to write typical people? I'll tell you why: It's just not smart enough to do it.Twenty years ago, this show might have had something interesting to say. Today, it's just par for the course. We live in the Squid Games. There are poor people right now somewhere who are in the actual Squid Games. If you don't have a gun to your face, you are somewhere else on the Squid Games spectrum, which goes all the way to the other extreme, where losing means hearing the words: ""you're fired"".If you want to say something about the reality of poor people, it better be important. This series is clearly just gory entertainment. In Hollywood, there is greater awareness today that white authors can inadvertently create black stereotypes that don't age well. The same awareness doesn't exist when rich people fictionalize poor people for the exploitation of poor people. It's actually quite gross.Have dignity, don't watch this junk."
694,Squid Game,"Ok so I was having a difficult time remembering their on screen names as well as real names apart from Ali(Played by Anupam Tripathi).What made me watch this is ofcourse the way it topped the Netflix most viewed content chart and to be real it was indeed an experience for me.In the initial episode I remembered the characters like ""ok the North Korean girl"", ""Ok the lead actor"", ""Ok the bad guy and his gang "" etc etc.For me it is definitely an edge of the seat thriller as I almost binged it in two days.What me yawn was the final episode which probably laid foundation for the second season.I go with 9/10 here for the performances, the writing and the apt direction.The games have you in the moment where you probably forget you were breathing too.Go for it."
695,Squid Game,"The concept carries the film. It's really interesting, but unfortunately the player interactions are sooo cliche and corny. They're like the last seasons of the Walking Dead, for those that have seen them. The ending game especially was just so bad. They tried to establish ambiguity about the main character's ethos in the first episode, but it all goes out the window and he becomes just 100% angelic good guy, which is frustrating and annoying to watch.I still enjoyed it, I suppose, but with each episode I liked it less and less. It's fine to entertain yourself for a week but it isn't something to come back to."
696,Squid Game,"I enjoyed the show up until the ending, I knew the premise of it before beginning it, its a hunger games and survival show. I wanted to know the why of it, it's the reason I decided to watch. I found it a bit violent, but it had great visuals, very colorful and actors where not bad either, I actually empathized with main characters and enjoyed the side stories. However, the ending was terrible, I was expecting much much more, on the investigative side the detective does very little and I was dissapointed that he actually gets killed without mercy and further by the front man, who is his brother, and his side of the story is never told. I agree that would make a good second season material, however, the last scenes where the old man reveals he created the game with his buddies for entertainement purposes, and to relieve boredom with no further purpose, is killing all the mystery and there would absolutely be nothing new for the second season in terms of mystery, just need for revenge. The old man, instead of using his money to do good, he created and apparently participated in children's games, where he bets with his rich buddies and kills the poor men and women who are indebted and obviously need help. Rich people killing poor people just for entertainment, I find it disgusting and without substance. Overrated show and terrible ending. That ending spoiled the second season for me."
697,Squid Game,Wow so exiting and good! Loved it so much! Highly recommend it you wont regret it.
698,Squid Game,"First off, this show is worth a watch, despite my rating for it. It is entertaining and gets you hooked (though it definitely won't get you hanging on the edge of your seat). The problem is: the plot is weak, riddled with clichés, and full of plot holes.There is no such thing as a surprising plot twist in this show. After the first couple of episodes, you already know exactly what is going to happen. As I said, it is okay to watch when you have nothing else to see, but, in my honest opinion, it is super undeserving of its 8+ rating and not at all worth all the hype.Here's a small, very limited, list of a few issues I found with it. (ATTENTION: SPOILERS):
What are the odds that, in a group of 201 people, they would make a vote and that vote would be split exactly in half, with the last one to vote being the tie-breaker? Seriously, I think that the odds of that vote ending 101 to 100 are less likely than the odds of a show like that existing in real life.They talk a big game about how they strive to provide a space that is equal for everyone, and are even apologetic when something doesn't go according to that rule. Well, sorry to say, but if you allow the very OWNER of the criminal organization play the games and not suffer any consequences when he loses, then you are absolutely NOT providing a fair and leveled playing field for everyone. Also, the dude with the tattoo got MULTIPLE benefits throughout the show. Here are a few:1. When someone threatened to kill another player, they would instantly face the threat of being killed themselves by the show staff. However, when tattoo dude kills someone in front of the staff, he suffers no consequence whatsoever.2. Tattoo guy agreed to play the marbles game one way. However, when he started to lose, he cried foul to the staff and they actually allowed him to change the game (seriously, that was ridiculous plot armor for him)
3. Whenever someone refused to play a game, they would instantly face the consequences, as people needed to keep playing to provide the VIPs with more entertaining value in the finale. When tattoo dude refuses to play on the glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens to him. Seriously?Anyways, back to the regular stuff:
The plot, as I previously mentioned, is constantly obvious and easy to guess. Everyone knew the smart dude would become a villain, everyone knew that the lady that didn't find a partner for that marble contest would be left alive, and everyone knew that tattoo dude was not going to lose that marble game because he just had the most incredible, unbreakable plot armor in history. It was also obvious as heck that the competition that was in pairs was going to make one character play against the other. And they acted like all of those were like huge plot twists. Do you think your audience is that stupid?There is no real tension that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout the show because the main characters are the only ones that are thoroughly explored, and you either love them or hate them. No matter what happens, you ALWAYS know that the team in which the protagonist is on is going to win, and you can always figure out who is going to win or lose in all contests. In the marble contest, again, they had MULTIPLE opportunities to actually introduce a valuable plot twist, but no. Face tattoo dude lives, protagonist lives, smart guy lives, north korean girl lives, crazy lady lives. You can just see the producers were desperate to keep these characters on because they, themselves didn't have enough faith in their work to think that it would be able to sustain itself after killing off a main character.Another RIDICULOUS plot device was the body of the guard that the police officer killed washing up exactly on the island were they were holding the games, when he threw the body off of the boat in THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. That scene was completely unnecessary and broke my immersion on the show even more.Are you telling me that Ali, a guy who came all the way from Pakistan to live in South Korea ACTUALLY managed to learn how to speak Korean, one of the most difficult languages for non-native speakers, flawlessly and perfectly, but didn't know what even or odd numbers were? REALLY? SERIOUSLY?And then there is the ending. So, this show is going to tell me that that stupid main character, who did absolutely nothing throughout the show, didn't even manage to win it by himself, is now going to take on a whole criminal organization that even has its own island? The dude is going to go from a jackass who can't even wipe his own butt and lives off of his mother's money in his 30s to a John Wick type of guy who can destroy anything he touches? What a terrible ending to a severely underwhelming show.There are many more ridiculous plot holes to be talked about, those are just some of the highlights. However, since this review is already long enough, I'm going to leave it here.Very mediocre show. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to see, but do not believe the hype. 6/10 (being very generous)."
699,Squid Game,I kept seeing it #1 on Netflix so decided to give it a try. It was slow paced but interesting. I was bored at times. There are much better Korean shows and movies so not sure how this one caught on and became so popular. Overall it was fine.
700,Squid Game,"Endings are hard for even the best writers and nowhere is that clearer than in season 1 of Squid Game.After what amounted to one of the year's most powerful, poignant, and emotional seasons of television, Squid Game falls flat on it's face with one of the worst season finales in recent memory.At the core of this unfortunate misstep is an apparent desire to insert a twist where none was needed, and the worst kind of twist at that, the kind that devalues the emotional weight of the entire story.Squid Game is still a fantastic journey and would easily be a solid 9 or 10/10, just maybe skip the final episode."
701,Squid Game,I just loved it! You can easy watch it during all weekend non stop! It's so much different from other series available. Completely different genre.Recommended to everyone.
702,Squid Game,"The idea is phenomonal, to create some fun for those who have every social and material satisfation within normal human societies and to offer an opportunity for those who are nothing and have nothing within normal human societies. Inspiring extreme setting, but we should be careful that it cannot represent the whole society."
703,Squid Game,"This series is one you have to stick through, I did want to turn it off because it took a while to get to the point, but I'm glad I didn't. Only thing I was not a fan of was the VIPs, they're very unnecessary and could have been left out. Other than that, it is put well together and detailed. I enjoyed it."
704,Squid Game,"I'm just gonna say this right off the bat, Ali deserves better. Period. That scene where Sangwoo betrayed him got me clutching my pearls and choking on air. I've never been one to watch K-series, and this series got me hooked! The acting is exceptional for all Korean characters EXCEPT the VIPs. What in the name of Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers was going on with their horrendous, cold, bleak acting?Aside from that, I appreciate how realistic and simple the plot is, but it is so well-developed. The one fact that hits hardest for me is the fact that if this game was to take place tomorrow, people would actually partake in it. Even more so, the same betrayals and back stabbing would happen too. Something chilling about that fact to me."
705,Squid Game,"What I loved most about this show is the acting was fantastic (with the exception of the white VIPs - they were terrible actors - perhaps on purpose), the backstories were believable and heart wrenching, and the suspense was very real. This wasn't violence for the sake of violence. I found myself rooting for certain characters and I was invested in the storytelling. The ending also didn't disappoint. One of the best Netflix shows I've seen. Very much looking forward to season 2. Also, viewing tip: don't watch with English voices dubbed over. Do the subtitles. It feels more real and genuine. You really get a sense of emotion in the voices."
706,Squid Game,"Every time I started watching this I could not get into it. Today I decided to give it a try and I was completely hooked. The story was really good and I Watched the whole season in 2 days. There were some potholes, so I'm a little confused about Certain things but, overall it was really well done. Looking forward to another season."
707,Squid Game,"It keeps you excited from the start, the end was stretched could have been better.Beautiful concept Loved it !!This shows the new concept can work."
708,Squid Game,"This series is exceptional. It poses a narrative which delves into the human psyche. Themes of duality, choice, power and control are played out within the game. The series is analysing socio-political, gender and class binaries within stunning scenography, beautiful symbology and a compelling story line.I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Battle Royale, or Asian Tartan Extreme films."
709,Squid Game,"Extremely enjoyable. I believe it deserves its high rating. It invokes a lot of emotion and keeps you wanting more. Many life lessons to be learnt especially about trust. It reminds me if why the saying money is the root of all evil, and we see how betrayal even in the most unlikely people is caused by money and its possibilities to solved our life's financial difficulties.... A must watch. Korean thrillers and horrors are truly enjoyable."
710,Squid Game,"It was such an amazing show! I binge watched it and I hope they have a season 2. You sympathize with all the characters and you stay on the edge of your seat on every episode, and the performance of the actors that was amazing!"
711,Squid Game,"I'm kind of blown away by this masterpiece. It does has it's flaws, mainly in the dubbing / subtitle area, but that's pretty common with asian movies. I guess it's next to impossible to do this 100% right. The series has awesome characters, not a single weak filler episode and many wtf moments. It's a fresh breeze in the world of Netflix' teenie action series that are basically unwatchable as soon as you are older than 25."
712,Squid Game,"Copy cat from Arena (2011)The story is senseless, i liked the authenticity in the Korean environment, more like a documentary for me than 'entertainment' because the sequence of events is just not plausible nor logical."
713,Squid Game,"It was a colourful as a ROMCOM. Guess for movies like this the color tone should be as it's in SAW.Didn't feel connected to any character.Hundreds dying, blood sprouting from bodies but yet no thrill.Last 3 episodes were just dragged, had to forward scenes just to finish this series."
714,Squid Game,"You play, you will die or win, it's easy.The main idea (( A match that everyone needs to survive from a life and death game)) is an old idea, but it still has a great potential for making great movies and series like this.I really enjoyed it when I was watching it. The actors played great, the music is stressful and great too, the main story and games are carefully selected.In my opinion everyone can watch this series and enjoy it, not for searching for little mistakes."
715,Squid Game,"Everything works for me. The concept, the acting, the twist, the tone, the plot, everything.Superb."
716,Squid Game,"The whole series is tense in every game, as if you were playing for real there hahaha (if you get spoilers, it feels different). BUT ONLY ONE, EWW FOREIGNER VIP GUEST... THEIR ACT LIKE TRASH, SOO CRINGE. But it doesn't reduce the tension tho, hihihi. And in Korean dramas, there are always scenes that make you cry... prepare your tissues."
717,Squid Game,"I just finished watching this series and just loved it. I thought it was a series that would somehow disappoint me but as soon as I started watching it I couldn't stop.I liked the fact that it was a few episodes and that it didn't overly stretch the storyline. The colors, the scenography, the music and every single detail has become iconic.I found the acting of the various characters very beautiful.The series has managed to adapt to a more Western context, managing to make space around the world."
718,Squid Game,"Very well written and new concept with little flaws or missing scripts. But overally a very good show. The only thing I found that it's very slow.Shows every aspect of humans in a good fictional ways how each one betrays or kills or uses others for own survival. And the last episode where he tells how you bet on horses we on humans, shows the power of hierarchy. A very well written story as always I've seen other works of the director and he never disappoints badly."
719,Squid Game,"I want to dedicate this review just for episode 6 which involves a marble game.Episode 6 is the greatest piece of emotional rollercoaster i have ever watched. This episode is depressing, shocking, tender, furious, helpless, funny, intelligent and cunning. Unbelievably good and sick!Just this episode alone deserves an award for the team.Overall, it's a great series even though personally i didn't like the last 2 episodes."
720,Squid Game,"The core idea of the games are interesting, but the terrible writing, terrible story and terrible acting make it really tough to finish. Additionally, beyond the first game, and maybe parts of the second the games themselves are boring and usually a slog to get through. But don't worry if you missed anything in the show, there will be nine different actors monologuing exposition.recalling what ou just watched seconds before, and even that will most likely be followed by an extremely unnecessary flashback. It's all just so so heavy handed, and this entire series honestly should have just been a 90 minute movie. Look there's some good in there, and I'm not dismissing it entirely as trash, but man, even the ending is terrible in 3-4 different ways. So look, if you want to see what everyone was talking about l, turn your brain all the way off, get your phone or laptop to do something enjoyable and put it on in the background. BUT, if you value your time, find some recaps online or some YouTube videos breaking it down and call it a day. I promise you that you're not kissing anything life hanging or profound - it's a simple show made for background viewing at an airport bar at best."
721,Squid Game,"In this amazing documentary The World Economic Forum and it's sociopath members have lured ""Climate Change"" deniers and ""vaccine"" hesitant people into a deadly game of life and death. Will the people wake up and unite or are we all doomed to a future under the boot of the worst people on the planet..."
722,Squid Game,Really enjoyed the series. Probably would have given it a 9...that ending though.
723,Squid Game,"The survival game trope isn't usually my thing, but this one was actually done really well. The characters are complex with backstory so it's not just all about the games.I agree with everyone else about the VIPs. Prepare yourself for them and try to pretend they didn't happen. I can't wait for the day kdramas stop sticking random English speakers into their shows. They're always the worst actors and no matter how good the show and the Korean actors are, the English speakers always instantly make the scene cheesy and look and act like a fish out of water.To be fair I have spoken to a Korean friend who told me that due to the language barrier this awkward delivery isn't picked up on in Korea. But just a warning, the English speaking scenes in this show were the most cringy I've seen in any kdrama, both acting wise and writing too for some reason. The rest of the show was great.Otherwise, highly recommended. I loved the last episode, and it seems they left room for a possible season 2."
724,Squid Game,"I gave somehow high rating because this TV show brings something new/fresh. But I cannot say that I ""like"" it. No, I don't like it. It's boring in the beginning, then there's some highlights when games begin, and slowly it goes ""the wrong direction"". Often it's not convincing, not clear, and sometimes doesn't make much sense. I will not spoil here. Worth watching? I guess yes (if nothing better available), but I don't really look forward to the second season that I surely expect to come."
725,Squid Game,"Therefore I vote it in the gutter, because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it."
726,Squid Game,"I initially gave this a 9/10... then it was mid way through my 2nd rewatch of the show when it clicked... I almost NEVER rewatch any show, and this is the first time I've ever watched a live action foreign show. That's what clicked and made me give it 10/10.In such a short span of time, you get an emotional connection to the characters despite not even speaking the same language. The show has it's flaws, but by far one of the best shows I've ever seen."
727,Squid Game,"I know that as one ages one turns into a grumpy old flatulating individual passing plenty of not just faeces but righteous judgement on a collapsing morally bankrupt world. All said, this 'review' comes from a person who saw Lord of The Flies when about 14 after our superb English teacher felt it worth seeing after we read the book as part of our education. I found both the book and movie so traumatic they changed my life. But probably in a good way. The point being made that below a certain age or level of training, young people are not suited to positions of power or leadership. More recently, productions and video games based on the Battle Royale principle also alert us as to the ethics of exploiting vulnerable young people for the schadenfreude entertainment of adults and a baying public. Sadly, The Hunger Games put production spectacle and creepy puppeteers ahead of violence, so the point wasn't really made, but it has the benefit of warning a younger audience how some adults use them.*** SPOILER ALERT ***
I had never heard of Squid Game and happened to catch it on Netflix last night where I saw the first episode. What got me was now just how there was NO humor in it at all, common with today's productions, but the pure blood spurting realistic brutality of the scene where the giant 'little' girl guns down those who are caught moving.As per The Hunger Games, the aesthetics and production design is superb, but can someone explain to me WHY such content is produced in the first place? Is Squid Game entertainment or a warning? And why is it a 15, not an 18? Alien was never gratuitously violent (they were at war) yet an 18 or X when released in the 70s. I know, I saw it when 15 and was terrified!My rating is based on the ethics of SG being a 15, not the quality of the production,"
728,Squid Game,"Very new and interesting story, talented cast. This Show makes you think about debt and suffering, and about what people are ready to do in order to get money. In spite of 2 episodes are not good enough, Show deserves good reviews."
729,Squid Game,"The Hunger Games meets Pat Sharps Fun House. Loved it and made me think about all those childhood games I played. As with most films that have been dubbed some of the characters are on the eccentric side, but that's something you have to expect."
730,Squid Game,Meh.Update when I finish but so far nothing really stands out for me or remotely exciting. Y'all are insane for this. What's all the racket about????
731,Squid Game,"I'm sure by this time most of you have seen this series and I'm glad to have watched it as well the minute it came out in Netflix. For those who haven't, there are a lot of memes and clips showcased in FB and Tiktok..and in all honesty watching this is an absolute treat.We are all aware by now how Koreans can leave us in awe when it comes to the series or movies that they create. And Squid Game is an interesting and unique concept, something that left me fascinated until the end. Some may think that it is just a series with gruesome games involved, but frankly that is the part which makes it exciting like hell.Short but sweet as it only contained 9 episodes, and although the ending will keep us curious and wanting for more, it's enough for me to understand the plot and message it meant to deliver.Would you want a Season 2? I know I would."
732,Squid Game,"A powerful series, a powerful message. Amazing experience."
733,Squid Game,"This film is great, it deserves to be a phenomenal film this year. Apart from Squid games, there are many other survival games genre films, but what distinguishes Squid Game from other films of the same genre is that it departs from the real reality of human life. People in debt look for all kinds of ways to pay off their debts, even if they risk their lives. Meanwhile, among the rich, the struggle of the poor becomes entertainment for those who are tired of a life that is always fulfilled. This reality is sad, but this is what actually happened.In the end, when the 456th player has won the first prize and the billions of prizes, he does not find happiness because he has sacrificed the lives of his friends. Money becomes meaningless and his life is not like it used to be."
734,Squid Game,"This film is amazing, deserves to be a phenomenal film this year. The selected players can portray the characters well, especially Kang Sae Byeok. There are many other films with the theme of survival games, but what distinguishes squid games from others is that it departs from the issue of social reality in society. Squid game provides a heart-wrenching reality that humans who are in huge debt are willing to do anything, including selling their lives for a deadly game. As for the conglomerate people who are tired of having got everything they want in life, they see the hardships of the poor as entertainment. In the end, the winner of this game realizes that winning money by killing others is not something fun, so the 456 billion is meaningless. This is what I think makes the Squid game very popular."
735,Squid Game,"Battle Royale made the path so I can't give the 10 stars because that movie paved the way for this show.If you don't like thrillers sparkled with a bit of gore, you'd better pass, otherwise you're in for a great ride.It is very dark, the character development is well made. In 9 episodes you get attached to them.Don't listen to the people discussing the violence, you see worse in Hollywood but without the psychological scenario.There were plenty left for explanation but not in a frustrating way. More of I let the viewer decide. Great addition to the Netflic catalog allover."
736,Squid Game,It's an amazing take on a really dark side of entertainment and games.
737,Squid Game,"Top everything, go watch it, no seriously, this show was it for me.10/10."
738,Squid Game,"One of the best series i have every watched! It gives you suspense, drama and exciting moments. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. The characters are well established, the performances are exceptional. Please do watch it!"
739,Squid Game,"Wasn't planning on watching this series but all my friends and colleagues have been talking about it and I wanted to be able to discuss it with them, given the hype.It was alright, not worth the hype honestly.1st off, the costumes are a complete rip-off of Money Heist. 2nd, the story is basically the hunger games but in Korean. Thirdly, the ending wasn't good. Lots of things didn't add up and loose ends left.I actually lost interest around the 7th or 8th episode but stuck with it to see what happened. Not much, is the answer.If you want a better foreign series to tuck into I suggest 'The Chestnut Man'."
740,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a barbaric, dramatic, and intense indictment of modern capitalism with very in-your-face demonstrations of poverty, power, and ruthless murder. The acting and the script makes the whole thing come alive and certain episodes, particularly episode 6 and 8, had me on the verge of tears. If you watch them you will understand why. The show has some flaws, mainly some unneeded sex scenes and some questionable plot points. However it hits all the right beats and became the mass hit that it has by demonstrating the ruthless sociopathy of capitalism. This is summed up best at the end with the justification for Squid Game: it was fun."
741,Squid Game,"Squid Game is one of those films/series that sticks with you days and weeks after you watch it. It's hard to put your finger on exactly why because at face value it's a really bloody gore fest. I have a very low tolerance for violence and gore but somehow this isn't about that. It's a study of human nature; a tale of haves and have nots, oppression, luck, desperation, love, friendship, greed and hope. Korean film is so rich in story telling it's simply refreshing. This is an exceptional work of art. I loved so many things about it but the main character and the old man and the successful pride of the neighborhood are spectacular in every nuanced scene. I think what makes Squid Game so great is that we recognize these people either in ourselves or in those around us. We cheer for them, hate them, understand them. Don't miss this film. Watch it with subtitles and let the native Korean language lead and watch it in doses. Binging is a LOT to handle in this one."
742,Squid Game,"While this is somehow entertaining, yet there are a lot of boring moments, especially, as stated in other reviews, the terrible acting by half of the total cast.This show suffers of the repetitive design of many aspects, such as the costume, music, places, even the reaction of the actors.Also, there is always a boring moment between the games, and that's while the games it self are not epic nor serious but some how they finish it with lots of blood and death..."
743,Squid Game,"The premise of this story is not unique, although the setting up of the games to the death in the form of well-know children's games is unique. The first, second and third episodes were interesting and worth watching, but I feel you if you skipped to the last episode after that you wouldn't have missed much.The conclusion of this series is clearly made with an eye on a second season, which is regrettable as it would have given a much stronger ending to the story line if there was finality on the outcome of the lives of all involved.In summary, I can understand why the show is so popular, but in essence it's an old recipe being revisited and recycled for a new audience."
744,Squid Game,"The games ar nothing but a real life projection, ""a democracy"" based on rules made by capitalism, no one takes it seriously until you need money... you work with no limits and you never find happiness... try to look different into this movie and you will find the true message, true about rules in society, about democracy, and how people change themselves how money can change someone, overall great story, great idea."
745,Squid Game,"Despite how predictable was the plot, I watched it in two days. Well done!BTW, wtf with those VIP characters at the end, they were obnoxiously cringe. Bad acting or they made them on purpose?"
746,Squid Game,"Maybe the main dude wasn't just so dumb and annoying, half the characters are hard to stand."
747,Squid Game,"I tried, I really did. After reading so many positive reviews on the series, I gave it a try. Not just once...Overacting, seen mostly in Chinese kung-fu flicks, hit me after 15 minutes. So I quit. But not quite, since my kids loved the show, and I gave it another try, watching complete 1st episode and half of the 2nd one. That's when I could not stand it any longer. The plot is quite predictable, the actors make stupid faces and a lot of unnecessary noise and movements. It just got plain silly and boring. Seen this story somewhere, or read some books with similar plots, I do not really remember. The point is: this crap of a series pretends to deliver some kind of message on greed, and people in need doing things they normally would never do... But it simply does not deliver, at least not to me. Been there, seen this somewhere."
748,Squid Game,"I normally don't view movies like these. I did enjoy and binge most of it until I got tired. The games and rules are original and fresh. There is lots of blood, gore and betrayal but this is expected considering the games are life and death. My only complaint was there was too much talking, a lot of could have been shortened-those I fast forwarded. I gave this 7 stars."
749,Squid Game,"If you're a person who shys away from international cinema because you're not keen on subtitles or cultural barriers - this one is for you. Squid Game is so engaging, entertaining, and so well done that you forget entirely that you are watching a film in another language, from a different culture. I loved every episode and can't wait for season 2!"
750,Squid Game,"I understand its success, and I see that Netflix knows how to catch with a series (especially with such a remarkable visual production). But on a personal level, I did not enjoy it, I saw it complete just because it is entertaining, but just. It seems to me that the only way to enjoy it would be to ignore the multiple script holes and inconsistencies in the plot, or to appreciate only the technical-visual section."
751,Squid Game,"Squid games is amazing! From the first episode to the last, the tv series had my attention! Can't wait for season 2.Explores human psychology really well!"
752,Squid Game,This is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games. Don't want just waste of time.
753,Squid Game,"The first episodes were definitely hooking and story and characters were well built and interesting. But the second half got really boring and predictable. Full of of really stupid situations, non-logical story telling and absolute non-sense actions of many characters which kind of ruined it. Also, the open ending for second season...? Just finished it because...But many times, I was just in mood to turn it off..."
754,Squid Game,"Alright so tiktok influenced me to watch this and everyone was saying it was the best ever and it was good but way to overhyped, everyone was treating it like the second coming of Christ."
755,Squid Game,"I really dont know where the hype comes from. To me its aight, but not like wooowwww!!A lot of mistakes throughout the whole show, makes it unbelievable and sometimes pretty boring. It was okay to watch but not in a matter of you really should watch this show."
756,Squid Game,"The three things that I look for when watching something are storytelling, performance, and attention to detail. Squid game passes all of those with flying colors. The storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. Going into this, I thought that a show about deadly children's games would get cheesy at points, but boy was I wrong. This show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. There isn't much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the VIP's that spoke English) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional Rollercoaster. Lastly, I'm the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. I can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because I didn't catch a single inconsistency. It seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.This show is brutal, bleak, and doesn't sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche's. It feels authentic from start to finish. Definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch."
757,Squid Game,"First of all, this review will contain heavy spoilers from the get go so stop reading if you haven't watched the show.Let's begin wtih a simple question. Can it all be justified? I am not trying to defend psychotic violence and sadism as well depravity of a satanist-looking cult full of rich boys billionaires but...As the old man finally said the obvious: They did it all on their own volition. They knowingly signed the rules. THEY chose to abide by it.. Further they could put an end to it anytime they wanted with majority voting.Also let us isolate one incident. The pancake game. If we set aside the GI Joe soldiers who - mind you- were always cordial, polite and abided by the rules such as to eliminate those who reveal face or take out the literal trash who chose to break the rules in their little hooligan clique of organ harvest... It remains to a fine testament that a self-declared 'dimwit' loser who lives with his Mother can achieve the impossible - ie solving the umbrella puzzle with a literal gun pointed to his head. It's almost Campbellesque hero's epic and akin to a rite-of-passage transformation of handling a hot iron rod.So despite the psychotic riot mayhem and meaningless killing from day 1, this shows that conditions were more than fair. Afterall no one can take that confidence and self-efficacy he learned under the crucible. In fact, the conditions were ""MORE"" fair than real world.If we buy this lock, stock and barrel.. then it answers as to WHY this senseless violence can be justified. Whereas the cruel outside world kicks people to the curb, here is a perfection opportunity of harmony in anarchy with soldiers in consort with managers acting as the great equalizers.The final window scene was the ultimate culminating point and great capstone to this otherwise bitter critique of capitalism. Yes, many people read the obvious scathing attack on it, and even a Washington Post article highlighted the irony of the fact that they are basking on the same pile of money enabled by the very system they criticized.. But but I don't think it that black and white.If anything, that scene (as well as the previous powerful scene of 'brother' sparing 'brothers' life...) serves as a striking footnote and glaring closure to the triumph of humanity and compassion.Yes, life is cruel. Yes, capitalism enables the powerful and rich to exploit the ones lower at the bottom if not ask for fellatio whilst people are dying like race horses in a bloodsport. Yes, it is a dog-eat-dog world outside....But at the same time like the ever-cliche rose climbing out of stone, so is the power and magic of humanity, hope and love.(And that brings the point even closer to me. I felt I could relate with the protagonist having found myself in a similar situation although priveleged to live in SoCal. But despite living the simple life, I am also aware that eventhough it may seem to be a cruel world out there, it is also a serene one. What would really happen if entire Earth was reduced to a prison as a social experiment? Sans minor glimpses of riots and ever-concurrent wars... human in general are peaceful and righteous. Even though our planet sustains of globalist capitalist economy, look outside the window... Do you see people devolving to their base and depraved instincts? No...Because despite all our flaws, humanity still has the spirit of God within.)Thus in a way, it manages to do the opposite - instead of dissecting the capitalistic eschatology to shards, it drives home the point and highlight that even if human were put in a situation where you are pitted against another for a huge pile-uh-cash, you would still choose compassion over violence. Even if a homeless person is dying on the street, there is still a kind and gentle soul watching over you like guardian. Even if you earn money through a slipknot of violence, you still preserve your humanity and look after those childhood gradnma-aunt who took care of you and took you under their wing like their own son. These.. these values can never be traded no matter how corrupt and diseased our moral compass may seem to reveal otherwise on the exterior. Albeit all it takes a flake of wainscot to break the tipping point and start riots and anarchy as seen from real life and the movie Joker, but under all the seeming inhumanity and cruelty resides a powerful, calm Shiva.On a separate note, this movie also exploded our blinkers as to what Korean lifestyle, culture and movies are about after year after year and movie after movie of kung-fu tropes and what not. It shattered mine at least.. and I never bought the hype mistaking it for being cringy as BTS. Haha...What does blinkers mean anyway..."
758,Squid Game,Koreans don't hold back. They make stuff as real as possible. They show how ruthless life in without any filter. This show was very well made and nicely paced. The games were well thought out and implemented. Even though we kind of know whose gonna win they masked that well. There was also good character choices and development in the film. The plot twist at the end was awesome too. Very mature dialogues and story! The sets were also well thought out and colorful and the background music was unique and fit well. Very entertaining show.
759,Squid Game,"I really liked the show, the beginning for me PERSONALLY was just a bit boring but I clung on and was attached to the show by the end of it. If you have watched the show, you'll know about THAT episode and.. I was speechless and broken by the end of it and it was great, the actors were amazing at portraying all the emotions.The ""VIP's"" voice acting / acting were.. horrid HAHA it was so bad, I just couldn't help laughing. The ending was rough and messy and I wasn't a big fan of it especially how they forced hinted the second season :/Overall, I really recommend it, the show is great, the actors are awesome and you really feel the emotions and the vibes they emitted. It truly was a rollercoaster and I recommend this ride. Each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next."
760,Squid Game,"The series is good mediocrity at best. But it seems to hit the nerve of the times and will be back to normal. Fortunately, all hype is over.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
761,Squid Game,I started it thinking it to be some intemse thriller with plot twists. But this is Pretentious garbage with no real thrill and not even single interesting twist. Waste of time.
762,Squid Game,"SQUID GAME is a series with a lot of common with HUNGER GAMES
in other words it is like hunger game with more fantastic and weird challenges ..The thing that Iliked was the message that it offers''Money do not bring happiness'' and that people can kill their friend for the sake of money
it has an intresting plot and actor's performances are good too
i was also burst into tears in ep 6BUT there are some disadvantages that should be taken into account ...such as there are tooo many violence scenes that should not exist in my opinion and some plotwist that i had already expected them .The issue with the policeman at the begging was intresting and i thought that he may help competitors to escape but he did not do something important to the plot , he could not to exist or be somehow different.Finally it has a weak ending .. it could be better .To my mind there are such a lot masterpiece of Korean industry and this one is not one of them but i reccomend to watch it only if you are 18+"
763,Squid Game,"The concept is pretty good-how far would you go to win a life changing amount of money, especially when you have hit your lowest point? I think a good 2 hour movie would have worked just as well; start by cutting out the entire ""VIP"" nonsense. Everything else was so well scripted and designed, how did that part fail so badly? Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful. This appears overall to be a high value production, great costumes, sets, cinematography, why skimp on something as necessary as captioning?"
764,Squid Game,"Folks, it IS entertaining!. However, taking into consideration everything that happens throughout the first sasn, the end is CRAP!If you're like me, someone who takes seriously how the story ends, this would turn into be a disaster!"
765,Squid Game,"Really enjoyed this Korean series, It's like Takashi's Castle with a story and severe consequences full of gore, violent and twists and holds no punches which is what I've come to expect from Korean series/movies. The only only criticism is that the VIP's acting was awful and I hope if a 2nd series is made they get rid of the English speaking actors. I've also watched Alice in Borderland which was good but this is better and more interesting. I would recommend this series and hope there is a second. If you enjoyed this, watch Battle Royale the ""Hunger games"" superior original."
766,Squid Game,"I liked:
1. The plot premise
2. The costumes
3. The setup
4. The plot
I disliked:
1. The acting is over exaggerated
2. Very minimal character development, the majority are unidimensional
3. Laughable reactions from most characters
4. Many scenes with screaming characters, can't they talk normally?"
767,Squid Game,STRONG start! It gets its tentacles wrapped around you and slowly looses its grip midway without taking a big enough bite of your brain to leave a lasting impression. I think they tried to cram too much while also slowing the pace down. I felt the marble episode was the turning point. It really dragged its feet even tho it introduced so much more story. Had they trimmed the fat and maybe kept it to only a few episodes it could have been great but ultimately it more sinks than swims by the end.
768,Squid Game,"I don't get the hype.. After episode 3 I wanted to just quit watching, but had to finish it. Not worth it. The plot is just weird and I don't get why every asian likr show I watch i feel like everyone is so childish."
769,Squid Game,"I'm surprised not that many people caught the main message of the show, as it is actually the reason for the show's popularity.Foreigners (ahem, the USA) import a capitalist ideology to Korea, get people to start rat-racing for money, and those that lost are rejected by the society and receive a second chance, where the Capitalism is purified and speeded up. People compete with lethal consequences in quite random and easy games for an enormous money prize. This is how liberals view capitalism and material success - pure luck based on random, worthless skills for the sick enjoyment of the immoral rich.It's somewhat ironic that in Korea's case we have an easy option to see what would happen to it under the ""other ideology"" by looking at the North. Yes, it's easy to imagine a world without competition and money, but I'm afraid you need to populate it with either angels or robots.Other than that, as is the case with many Asian films, there are annoying characters that employ overacting as a method to show their emotions, and who at the end you wish to kill with your own bare hands.On a plus side, it's swift action and the level of violence is what you would expect from a Korean show with a cult following in the West. It flies pretty fast, with only 9 episodes, although the end is pretty unambiguous - Season 2 is coming."
770,Squid Game,"Wanted to give up after episode one
Managed to force myself to watch episode 2My oh my what utter drivelWhat are these people give 9-10 scores smoking???Nothing happensThe main character is utterly unlikeableWorst series ever!!So dull."
771,Squid Game,"What's great about this series is that it doesn't just rely on the sensationalist disturbing factors alone, there's a decent plot with well arranged elements in the unravelling the story. The theme of playing for your life isn't necessarily unique but the formula is incredibly well done adapting the story in South Korea based on childhood games while telling a fable of social and economic struggles and what life is worth living for. I thought the main actors were great and we don't get to see enough of these characters but I hope this opens up exposure to more international productions.The production settings were also really impressive, and made the scenes all the more fascinating.I hope Netflix pays the creator the bonus he deserves given its success."
772,Squid Game,"Having watched all the episodes in a few days this was very enjoyable. Despite the games could've been a whole lot better (Takeshis castle type?) this had likeable and hateable characters to run through the story, some bits were slow paced and certain elements shouldn't have been there and used as a time filler but all in all was very enjoyable esp episode 6. Wish more stuff like this."
773,Squid Game,"As usual, imdb users have poor taste...squid games is one of the most boring series i've ever watched, too predictable....after the first killings in the first episofe, there is really nothing more to see...the worst part about it is that the protagonist is a freaking idiot."
774,Squid Game,"I went into the show with high expectations purely because of how hyped it has been in the media recently and honestly.. it's good. Not incredible like the media is playing it out to be but for its genre it's probably one of the best I've seen.I like the concept of this show, definitely reminds me of the hunger games.. all fighting over something with a common goal and everything just happens to fall in to place.. there's a lot of shows/movies like it but at the same time none quite like this one...Unlike most shows that fall in the same category I don't feel like this was too dragged out in anyway, everything had perfect timing and everything added to the plot nicely, it wasn't too repetitive and it continued to surprise me, it had many unexpected events that I honestly highly enjoyed.At first I wasn't quite sure how to feel about the ending.. a second season? Normally shows plummet when there is a forced second season but at the same time I'm glad there wasn't just some bland happy ending. Im excited to see how the second season pans out and I'll definitely be watching."
775,Squid Game,"I'm not into Korean movies, but I actually binge watched this one. No way to stop until the end. Every episode is a crescendo, until the end."
776,Squid Game,Some of the characters were so annoying they made you root for them to die. Gi-Hun was one of the most annoying ones. Good action that kept the pace going.
777,Squid Game,"First off the main character is unlikeable. I wasn't rooting for him the entire show. He's not exactly a good person and came off as annoying.Second, it took a LONG TIME for anything interesting to happen. The establishing backstory was very boring and very unnecessary. They could have told us everyone's stories in a couple of quick flashbacks and gone straight into the action!Third, this is not an original concept. I've seen this type of social commentary done a thousand times in a thousand different ways.Do yourself a favor and go watch Alice in Borderland. It's a much better show."
778,Squid Game,"Recommend!!Just finished watching season one, Somehow this season is good to watch. Eagerly waiting for another season.At first i was confused while watching but after episode two i was enjoying watching 😊... watching taste may be different from person to person but i recommend it to watch once."
779,Squid Game,I m speechlesss. Love this series.. One of the best.
780,Squid Game,I didn't even watch any single Korean series or movie before this . This is the first time I watched any Korean series and this series is just mind-blowing .. literally hooked me up in every episode . The director did a fabulous job . And this show is too dark so be mentally prepared before watching this.
781,Squid Game,A clear entertainer. Choice of actors is exceptional and everyone plays his/her part to perfection. Enough twists and turns to keep you involved throughout.Brilliant and honestly made series.
782,Squid Game,"All the praise for this ""brilliant"" series, full of ""original"" ideas. Go read The Long Walk and The Running Man by Richard Bachman (i.e. Stephen King). The Long Walk was the first novel he wrote (but not the first of his that was published)...it's over 50 years old, and was published over 40 years ago. Nearly everything this series is built on can be found there in a simpler format."
783,Squid Game,"Supporting Characters There is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.Story The story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn't work for me and I think it could have been handled better. Also there are these English speaking VIP's and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.Script The script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles. For the love of everything holy don't watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching."
784,Squid Game,"I could have done without the mandatory woke content from Netflix, as well as the nudity and useless profanity. This stuff brings nothing to the story. I started watching Korean shows because there is none of that, that is before Netflix started to produce content for this country. Other than that, good show and solid acting except for the vips, you know, the evil white men."
785,Squid Game,"So, I just finished watching the Squid Game and I have some contradictory feelings about it. For instance, some episodes get my heart racing. They're so good that you cannot look away from the screen and you start sweating in weird places!!! Then some episodes do very little character development, there is very little drama, there is very little addition to the whole series.Another thing that I think could've been improved (and maybe should be - if there is to be a second season) is that a lot of times there are enough clues in an episode where you can guess the exactly what is going on. The fact that doesn't ruin the show, must tell you how great it is. But, if you're looking for a big mystery, maybe this isn't your show, because you'll be able to guess what the heck is going on after just a few episodes."
786,Squid Game,"After having seen it, i must say i wasn't quite expecting it to be like this. I expected something savage & stupid like the Hunger Games movies. But this is much more intelligent, emotional & psychological. What starts off as a competition to survive the games gets emotionally disturbing & traumatizing half-way through. It makes you question morals & the dark side of humanity.Please don't watch this show if you're already depressed or going through a sad period in your life, as this show might negatively affect your mental health. There is too much sadness & grimness in this show.If you want to watch something dark, intelligent & original, this is a must watch."
787,Squid Game,"I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I committed a whole day in front of this show but it really caught me. Episode 6 had me bawling my eyes out. However, I feel like the last episode was a little disappointed. They tried to make you understand that you won't find happiness in money, but I just feel like the pace and the vibe were a bit off compared to the rest of the show. And such a shame to learn that the character whose ""death"" you mourned the most showed to be the evil guy all along."
788,Squid Game,"I'm baffled by the high reviews as I couldn't get past the second episode. The first episode was so cliche in setting up the main character and his situation it was painful to watch. Nothing original, just the same story of a guy that is lazy, steals from his mom, gambles, is a terrible father. Okay, we get it, it's why he goes to play this game. They had a chance to actually use an original approach to this 'desperate failure' needs quick cash, but nope, this series isn't up to it. Then you have to buy into a lot of completely unbelievable situations and places. I found myself fast forwarding through the 'vote off the island' scene. I finally gave up when they started the mom is now in the hospital. This is a soap opera with blood. No more. It's not even funny.I don't recommend this to anyone."
789,Squid Game,Starting watching in English dubbed and found it to be more amusing than anything. Switched to Korean with subtitles after episode 2 and reading various stories of wrong translation being used. Decent watch but predictable outcome which makes the games less interesting (when you know x y or z is in the next episode) ok twist but frustrating ending. Spoiler alert- who let's a debt ridden drunk just walk away with a random kid who he then leaves with his aunt ?!?!
790,Squid Game,"I liked it. Though I thought I'd hate the blood, it reminded me how I used to love to watch the Saw. It's not like the saw, but it's a great concept. And actually the scene that made me almost barf wasn't even blood but a naked man with the mask in the end. The concept it's great because it also shows how dependent people are on money.. these people felt worthless withiut money.. just sad.Now don't read my review if you don't want spoilers.I'm just sad that the cip didn't survive and you didn't even show where his body swam and what his boss thinks after that call. Just that made me give you star less."
791,Squid Game,"Don't believe the hype.Don't get me wrong, the show was entertaining and watchable, the cast mostly did a good job, the visuals were good.I liked it. But that's it. I just liked it. I wasn't blown away, it wasn't anything new to me, I won't remember this as a great show, I won't remember it as something that made me think about it a long time after watching.It had nothing that stood out, no great twist, no real depth. Surely some people won't agree on this point, but if you consider the obvious criticism on capitalism shown here as something deep... yeah.I found the build up in the first 4 episodes considerably more enjoyable than the second half of the series. The ending was just ok. Nothing more.So in summary this was solid entertainment. Definitely not worth the hype but enjoyable if you have nothing better to do with your time."
792,Squid Game,But story line is good. I reserve the right to change this when I'm done watching. Nothing so horrible that would make me turn it off. But the English voice actors are not great.
793,Squid Game,"The story is great, but the acting is extremely bad. The dialogues between and durnig the games are totally meaningless."
794,Squid Game,"🔺Next up is a Korean drama that became a sensation on Netflix in a single week, yes it is the same 'squid game'. Thought-provoking presentation away from the regular romantic Korean drama. I 've never seen much Korean drama, so I'm sorry if there is anything wrong with what I am saying. Squid is a series with a few plotholes, though not a lot of gameplay, and this series created the impetus to click next after each episode. It is definitely a very entertaining series.🔺The plot of the series is to catch debtors from different parts of Korea, bring them to an island, play six games with them and give a winner 45 billion Korean won. Games are games that were played in childhood in the past. But if you lose the games, you will lose your life !!!🔺As mentioned earlier, the squid game is a perfect item for a binge watch. A not-so-bad survival thriller. Although none of the subplots are excellent, the main plot is very well taken by the director. Those who are just starting to see Korean drama can start from this."
795,Squid Game,"This was a great reminder as to how concept can trump acting and writing. Even with some of the questionable choices of some performers, this show stands on its concept - which, though not new, is executed excellently. One of those that will likely be adapted for a western audience in the future. Solid watch, if you are not distracted by the more dodgy parts, and definitely better than a lot of other shows in the same genre at the moment. Cult classic methinks."
796,Squid Game,It is a very good show that once must watch. Best thing which I liked about the show is that this has ended in one season only. Other shows unnecessarily drags this to multiple seasons.
797,Squid Game,"Good show but really overhyped. I really thought it would be something special due to all those high praises, but it's nothing original. Gantz was superior. I guess some of the high rating is because some people only caught on how good Korean movies are, I'm not sure about TV series compared to US,( because of shows like Breaking Bad, Sopranos ) but for the last 10 years or so, Korean movies are much much better the rubbish that Hollywood have made."
798,Squid Game,"The series is great and worth the watch. I have to admit I already called the twist by the second episode, but the journey was great. The latter part of the season lost its way with some heavy cringe characters but I'll look past that. My biggest gripe comes with the latter part becoming cliché and in violation of what previous episodes had laid down, as in everyone has a fair shot at winning whereas the game they played was in gross violation of that (episode 7). Give it a watch though."
799,Squid Game,"An amazing work of art, direction, script, production and screenplay. Completely engaging until the very last episode. However, the director and his aides made a terrible decision by ending it how it ends. The entire build up to the very last episode comes down crashing for me towards the end of it.It made me change my rating from 8/10 to 6/10."
800,Squid Game,"This show is really good. A 'BIT' like a Korean 'Hunger Games'. The story is great and the struggles that dominate the plot create a lot of great tension. It reeled me in right from the start. Give it an episode and you'll be hooked.The things that hurt it:EXTREMELY poor dubbing. A few of the character's voices are so comically bad that it's pretty cringey at times.One actress is absolutely terrible and should've been either played by someone else, or the part should've been written out. So bad.The VIPs are pretty ridiculous.Other than that, I look forward to another season. Not sure what they can do with it after such a great start."
801,Squid Game,"Had me gripped from the beginning to the end.Some plot lines were signposted v obviously but it was still edge of your seat viewing. I love an open end that leaves you imagining your own conclusions. Well acted, good character development, heart breaking and whilst not entirely original it had enough going for it to make it stand out."
802,Squid Game,"I wish I could give it a 100 out of 10. It's a very well-thought-out series. Much is initially clear, but the intrigue was still there for me. Titanic for nine episodes."
803,Squid Game,"I literally freaking screamed. Sae Byeok was easily the best character in the show (sorry Ali) and quite obviously, the ultimate plot armor for the final game between the two men to happen.It was such a shame cause she was the only main character who never played dirty nor tricked anyone in order to win the games (ie In the red light green light game she could've pushed the antagonist who beat her up but didn't. Only used the knife she smuggled when the antagonist tried to kill her. In the marble game scene, aka the most depressing shh ever, she insisted on playing fair). Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom's vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn't help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead."
804,Squid Game,"I like the way the movie builds the main character.-The supporting characters also have their own story that makes the film more in-depth.-The game steals a lot but is improved.-The later episodes are not as good as the first ones but not too bad-Overrated , but not the problem.Just enjoy. Watch the movie if you're tired of looking for a new movie."
805,Squid Game,"The show hooks you right away on the first episode, but as the climax comes into play along with some supposedly plot twists being revealed, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.The characters don't make sense, especially Gi Eun and Sang Woo. Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. He is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don't get what he's thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It's not within his character to stab himself. He didn't even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok.The reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already.We also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.I had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.In retrospect, I think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. The actors did a fine job, and I think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn't buy happiness then it works out. But this ending? CHEAP.6.5."
806,Squid Game,It is nothing but an overhyped series . Games are made for fun . Here some psycho people somehow target bankrupt people to play game . Those who failed are killed by armed guard . Sometimes players took the life of each other . One winner among 456 people . Two twist as expected . It's a total waste for me . Nothing to learn from this idiotic series .
807,Squid Game,"Saw the trailer and wasn't going to watch. But then a friend recommended and insisted that I watched.Binged through it over one weekend and found it intriguing but not earth-shaking for me. The concept was interesting, and the moral of the story was powerful. The execution was great, from the movie making, shock value, and financial gain was amazing for sure.The story was simple to bring in desperate people to play games with their lives. The cruelty and brutality were the shock to most viewers. Yet, there were the body part scene which was too gruesome and the undercover policeman has no impact to the story line.And then, there was the ending ...."
808,Squid Game,This is actually good i gotta admit but it feels like kaiji like in every way.
809,Squid Game,That's is the masterpiece of Netflix but the end is not very good so that I give it 9 star but if thay make another season that will be different.
810,Squid Game,"This is in my top 10 shows for sure! Loved the acting the story, even the fan favourites will die so don't get to comfourtable watching this!"
811,Squid Game,Not gonna lie it did take me awhile to watch this show. But I gotta say. It was great. I actually really enjoyed it. I surprisingly liked a lot of the characters. I thought it was fun. I was infested in the story. Episode 2 did feel a little pointless. The last episode was probably my favorite. And yeah a great show that definitely deserves a second season.
812,Squid Game,"This is although has some ideas copied from Hostel series of movies.. it has more depth. Feelings human
flaws, and suspense. Although the English voice over
was more funny then the best it could of been done!Better then anything out of hollywood lately
and its not ruin by wokeness.. the real female
characters are strengths and color in this series
without pushing things in your face.Although the plot and ending was obviously
the twists at the end.. it didnt let it down overall for me."
813,Squid Game,"This show is extremely violent, which makes it hard to watch. There is not a sufficient payout at the end of the season to justify all the violence. I'm not sure my brain can unsee 100s of people shot point blank in the head."
814,Squid Game,"Just watch Kaiji, it's ten times better.Same ideas, better execution. The characters are boring and aside from good visuals this has nothing really entertaining.Zawa zawa."
815,Squid Game,I enjoyed this series. The acting was great even with subtitles! I was immediately drawn into this series and the characters. I really thought this was going to end a certain way but it did not. If you love horror and I guess Saw franchise this is up your alley too.
816,Squid Game,"I sat for months, waiting for the next amazing Korean show, being extremely ""Sweet Home""sick (I'm a dad, I'm allowed to make dad jokes.) Squid game popped up mid September, and I thought... maybe!But nope.Now I have to review it because, for whatever reason, it got popular recently.The visuals were great.Therein lies the positives.Now for the negatives.First off, stop calling it a Korean drama. It's not. (Of course, neither is Sweet Home.) It's a drama/thriller made in Korea for Americans. Korean dramas are a completely different genre.It starts with the same premise we've read a billion times. The 13 tzametti, Truth or dare, question of ""how far would you go for money?"" Likewise answered with the basic premise inspired by The Most Dangerous Game.From this non original start... it actually devolves. It devolves into a shallow Battle Royale, with false (and woefully unoriginal) social commentary delivered with a lack of subtlety that would make Andrew Ridker jealous. Then ends with a disappointing attempt at an altruism message. We saw, I swear, more depth in the Hunger Games series. Take that as you will.I know, seeing the success of the MCU, that people like their literary themes shoved in their faces these days, rather than delivered in a real story, and on that account, I can say Squid Game did superb work.I rarely ask for true originality, because I know there is nothing new under the sun, but if you make me a PB&J, and make a spectacle out of it, like you invented it, I hate you.If you want good Korean television with real (albeit, at times, also not so subtle) social commentary, just wait for season 2 of Sweet Home with me.Last notes: Acting is distractingly inconsistent, the characters aren't real people (I mean, the caricatures,) and the ""twist"" may be effective if you've never read a book or seen a movie."
817,Squid Game,"Was genuinely looking forward to watching what I had been led to believe was a bonefide classic. What a huge disappointment. Dreadful acting, appalling dialogue and just boring beyond belief. Dont believe the hype, this is utter rubbish."
818,Squid Game,"Strange mix of funny, childish elements with violence. Similar to The Cube or Danger Room movies with different people having to go through a labyrinth of horrors but done in a comedy style."
819,Squid Game,"Simply immersive. Thats my general consensus. I am only up to episode 4?(i am binging it so lost track) but this is almost meditative - the scope of this. The filmaking is on another level. Its so revolutionary, everything in it. Dont want to spoil it. Must watch..the acting is just superb and it will keep you guessing.The genre not to spoil is mystery/dystopia."
820,Squid Game,"Truly a well-directed, well-acted, well-produced and casted series. I dare say I wish it could continue, but all games must end to have a victor!Thank you for this very bingeworthy story. Thank you all cast and crew involved. Despite not knowing more than 3 words in Korean I recognized several actors. Goes to show, Hollywood ain't everything!*To those that find this 'boring', please understand you need Michael Bay or shiny keys to keep your attention. *snap* Hello?! Are you listening?!*"
821,Squid Game,"Gut wrenching. Dark. Predictable ending. Honestly, couldn't stomach it first four episodes. Last four, were easy to read and not so entertaining. Should have gotten on the plane and ended this series. He could have followed through with one thing in his life. Guess his daughter really isn't important. What was the point of her storyline?"
822,Squid Game,Concept is like a revival of battle royale (loosely) and very brutal. I was watching with an open jaw on episode 1. Slightly deteriorated a tad with each episode.I couldn't invest in any character enough to care. Don't make a second series and let this stand alone as a solid series itself. Like they should've done with a Handmaids Snail.
823,Squid Game,"This show start amazingly thrilling, until the fourth game this show became predictable and the characters are overacting, unlike the VIPs their acting make me cringe to the bone.The fourth game was great tho, Ali's innocence face got me, seo-byeok and ji-yeong friendship, Il-nam the old man (and we found out that he is the founder of the squid game), and the policeman finally met his brother and he's dead like for what?Lastly, the ending, the ending was too long and boring."
824,Squid Game,Its been a while since the last time time stopped while watching a series. A long waited time.
825,Squid Game,"I saw this before the hype train departed the station and I was hooked from the very first episode. My only gripe was some of the characters voices from the dubbed version when I watched it the first time round. Gi-Hun's voice was very dopey in the dubbed version and Mi-Nyeo's voice was so screechy and irritating her character was almost unbelievable.On the flip side of that, I've just finished watching it in Korean with subtitles and it changed the whole thing for me. It makes it much more serious, 'believable' and gripping than the dubbed version.Its not going to blow your mind or change your world, but it's simplicity, gripping storyline, thought provoking nature and brutality is where it's attractive. It's definitely worth a watch."
826,Squid Game,"It's derivative, but throw away fun? It has some interesting ideas, but is basically a silly fun way to spend a few hours. All this deep meaning crap, is really not appropriate, as it is not particularly insightful or original. The masses seem to love it because it's easy for them to understand and is an accessible silly show that they can discuss with their friends. I really hope there is not a season 2..........but as it is a big fat cash cow for Netflix, and is making tons of merch money, it's inevitable. If you want to watch something better than catch Battle Royale or read a book ha!"
827,Squid Game,"Some of the best cinema I have ever seen originates from South Korea. They are masters at layering dubious qualities on their protagonists, which often makes the lead characters quite unpredictable, yet still very relatable.For too long Western cinema has followed the narrative that the 'good guy' has to be a 'nice guy'.... when in fact, the majority of us look out for our own self interests when push comes to shove.I feel like the writers left a few plot holes here and there.... but overall Squid Game was very entertaining. I gave it a 9/10 despite its shortcomings."
828,Squid Game,"It's a fun and engaging show. It kind of reminds me of Oldboy, but oldboy is a movie and better. I hated the VIPs and some plotholes annoyed me."
829,Squid Game,I wish they would do more like this. Edge of your seat stuff every episode. The hype is real! I hope that there is a sequel and that it is equally as good! No pressure!
830,Squid Game,"Basically a Gore horror show like ""The Hostel"" but bubble tea store like colours and Costumes worn which gave the audience a thrilling experience of this ""weird feeling"" because our brains usually don't connect Horror with Happy colours. So yes this show is meant for those who love death and has desires to watch others being killed - for the psychopathic audience."
831,Squid Game,"Positive surprise, we know long ago that there is no more creative movies or shows from US, everything is just copy paste zero creativity. This show was so unique and strange I really enjoyed it. It starts really slow and I almost gave up on it. But once the first game starts the crazy stuff starts happening.. great work guys !P. S to Netflix Bring back Real PRIME STAR TREK YOU MORON. S ! I will unsubscribe!"
832,Squid Game,"I eventually got down to watching Squid game, and even getting a review out was very late. But here goes...Squid Game is great. One of the best shows of the year for sure, there is so much to pick apart of why I love this show. From a show that dives into narratives like classism, and society . How far will you to get out of a horrible place, what are you willing to sacrifice, and int he end will it really be worth it. Squid Game asks these questions through some great characters, some great visual imagery and a unnerving sound and audio you make you feel uneasy and of course great storytelling to get to that point.The idea about a battle royale format is nothing new, but it takes something like Squid Game to make it something special.Over time the series really makes you get into all the characters and their backstory and why they have come to this point. So when something happens to them you feel it emotionally. And the characters are complex, they are not one note, they all feel like they need to be there and you get why. And a show doing that in this type of format is rarely done well these days. The key to this show is its characters, and the actors that portray them put in all the effort to make it work, I wasnt disappointed by anyone.Only complaint I really have is the ending, I wasnt a massive fan of the reveal but it didn't take away too much. The journey to this point had been amazing so I was still left satisfied regardless.I rarely dabble in Korean cinema but every time I have I get a surprise like this. Very pleased with the results and am happy to have watched, even if it was later than most."
833,Squid Game,"I'm a huge movie person, very rarely do I watch series...... I binged this! I watched it with the English dub (this is something you forget about by episode 2), I don't care what you say, I enjoyed it just as much as I would subtitles. Great acting, awesome writing, very, very cool concept. I also don't buy the narrative everyone's barking about the bad VIP acting. They were likely casted to be unintelligent and rather elementary. This was actually cool to me because it made me think not everyone in power is smart and ""scripted"". This was the least of my concerns. Really enjoyed this one!"
834,Squid Game,"NOT A REAL SPOILER, BUT REVEALS THE TYPE OF SPOILER THAT EXISTSThe setup is great and everything is very intriguing, but by the end you realise not many of your questions were ever answered in a satisfying way. Clearly, there has to be another season, but I was hoping at least some of my questions would be well answered at the end of this one, even if they led to more questions. There were some reveals, but they didn't make much sense given what had already happened. They couldn't really have been foreseen. There wasn't enough information provided beforehand. It's just ""you heard of this guy, right? Well, this guy is also this guy for some reason."" Not juicy. Not juicy at all. It's like they answered the setup with another setup. I also feel like some characters didn't ever reach their potential. But maybe that's the point.What I liked was the look of the show, the atmosphere (soundtrack!), the characters, the acting, the humour, while it was there, and the concept. I definitely care enough about what's happening to watch season 2. There are some loose ends I'm glad were left loose.MINOR SPOILER IF GOING IN BLINDI also wish that the Netflix thumbnail/cover thing wouldn't reveal so much about violence of the game. Before anyone started getting killed, I knew people were going to get killed, so it wasn't as shocking as it was supposed to be. Paired with the foreshadowing of the whole slapping-in-the-train-station thing beforehand, I think the first game would have been a cool reveal. Maybe I just listened to the hype too late."
835,Squid Game,I m falling shortage of words. All i can say is it is 100/100 and a must watch for all thriller show lovers. All episodes are worth watching.
836,Squid Game,"This is the best ""Death Game"" / ""Battle Royal"" type of show I've seen in years. There are a dime-a-dozen of these shows in the anime / Japanese world and Squid Game is the best one in a long while. What's usually wrong with these shows is that they have a super natural element (gods, aliens) to them or outrageous reasoning as to how or why these games are evening taking place. That and the general writing is kind of ... well ... awful ... since these shows are usually about mass killing and the sick ways contestants have to be punished rather than concentrating on the actual characters.It's the well written character dialogues and backgrounds that keep you hooked, not the senseless violence on screen. Squid Game understands this. The best episodes are the ones with no direct violence to them. They will crush you.In other shows ""aliens"" or what seems to be literally a handful of people are running the whole thing. That's not good enough for me. Squid Game keeps it simple. Humans (a lot of them actually) run the show, and humans kill each other. I really appreciate the logistical side of the show, it keeps it grounded.As for the negatives, there is a small subplot involving a doctor that's really not that relevant to the show. Later in the season there's a group of people that you'll encounter and they are horribly acted. You'll notice it immediately when you get to it. Otherwise, amazing show, hope for another successful season 2 in the future."
837,Squid Game,"Very cool
Way way better than the Hunger Games.... Its in the same twisted vein as the recent Japanese TV series Alice in BorderlandA must watch."
838,Squid Game,"I cannot, for the love of God, imagine why this became so popular.1. The acting is atrocious. Super over the top, absolutely unbelievable, cringeworthy at best.2. The main character has hardly any character development and is difficult to identify with (also due to very very poor acting).3. The plot is super predictable and sometimes completely lacks logic (like with the policeman). If you think this is original watch ""Oldboy"" or ""Battle Royale"", ""Saw"" or ""Hunger games"" for pointless violence. These movies were made 20 years ago and, even though they are not good imo, they are far better than Squid game.4. The whole game is pointless and hard to understand. The reason why certain characters behave in a certain way is random and not at all explained. The scenario is lousy and dialogues are laughable.There is literally nothing good about this series. Waste of time. If you want something similar on Netflix from Korea then watch ""Hellbound"". It is leagues better than ""Squid game"" as it has good acting, a surprisingly deep story and a lot of realism in spite of the CGI and fantasy elements."
839,Squid Game,"Man I almost forgot what it was like to watch a show that's pure escapism and not Preachy at all, no Politically correct western BS here, no forcing Trans people down our throats, no throwing in some artificially diverse cast, no overly feminist BS, so refreshing to watch a show with a great concept that isn't ruined by Western ideology, I've never watched a South Korean show before but may start being my new favorites."
840,Squid Game,What are people prepared to do for money and survival? A lot obviously.Our poor protagonist- a sympathetic middle aged man with No luck in life gets the chance to participate in some kind of game Where to lose means elimination and elimination means death. The show is cruel and twisted in Ways that are hard to imagine. The actors are good and i like the hero - that was the only reason i followed through the whole show. If it wern't for those things i had given it a below average rating. This was a sick show to say the least.
841,Squid Game,"... the killings. The deaths are slow, graphic, cruel, in a great magnitude, and methodical.The good :
The first 20 minutes of Episode 1 are pure genius and beautifully acted out, not to mention all the real world scenes being quite moving.The premise itself is not about people playing games to get money; it's a very political TV series regarding wealthy people and possibly wealthy countries (note *all* portrayed as English speaking with American accents, except for the original Korean game creator) paying to watch the death games of those South Koreans forced into it from sheer poverty and circumstances.This series is an excellent embodiment of what selfishness and greed do on a grand scale. Rich people paying to see killings to pass the time.. and the need for people to help one another.The problem :
being what it preaches against.Showing killings in such great detail and magnitude as a TV Series, moves this from being educational to actually profitting off of what it (in premise) is speaking out against.There is a difference between a film making a point with a graphic moment, versus a TV series using that same point over, and over, spending most episodes embellishing slow, atrocious, selfish deaths -- making money off of what it is saying is wrong with the world.If it's so wrong, why are you showing it in such repetitive, graphic detail and making money off of it for the run of your series?This writer/ director has a wonderfully adept hand at directing, cinematography and storytelling as shown in the real world moments of this TV series. So he should certainly know how to show a piece of the atrocities, rather than making the viewers ""VIP's"" themselves. Thankfully I have fast forward so I got through the gruesome, repetative oppressive bloodshed and strangenesses... to enjoy the really earthy, complex storyline and acting inbetween."
842,Squid Game,"In recent months I have become a big fan of the South Korean Dramas, and when this one was recommended to me by one of my students, as the most popular show in Russia right now, with school kids, i thought it would be worth a watch.Disappointed. I can only assume it was not made for the SK market, but was rather produced for and with the influence of the US one, as the whole thing lacks what makes the SK dramas so enjoyable. Primarily, there is little to no humour in it, which even the darkest of their serials have, and secondly, it is so predictable, whereas every other one I have seen has major twists in the stories they keep you engaged from start to finish. In fact, it is a pale imitation of the Netflix Japanese series ""Alice in Boarderland""
Add to that, the cast lacked the intrinsic beauty of the SK actors, and it just bears not a jot of similarity to what makes their shows so good.The final evidence that this is not what it claims is apparent in the blades. What am I talking about? Well, but SK censorship law, blades of any kind must not be shown on camera; if you watch any of the other serials you will see that any knife, sword, axe, hatchet etc is blurred out, like the face of a witness in a real-life crime show.I watched the whole series and feel that this is an insult to what might be called a genre. If you.want to see a really good SK series, the best I have seen so far is Move to Heaven."
843,Squid Game,"Only 6 or 7 episodes worth of material stretched to 9.The American dialogue is pure shallow stereotype trash compared to the Korean's. You could still make them bad, but given them decent lines. Even the worst Korean parts had meaningful dialogue and had some sympathetic qualities.The script played a decent 8 and 2/3's innings. The last out could have gone for the fences, but instead was a meaningless 3rd strike check swing."
844,Squid Game,"Very gripping show and the characters have done a fab job..
Very well stiched show
Loved it
Can't wait for S2.Totally new content.... Have never seen something ofnthis sort.Emotions...Actions...Thrill..."
845,Squid Game,What a tremendous watch . Riveting series . Wasn't expecting this at all . Ended up being an all time classic. The Koreans have nailed it yet again . Hats off to them . Korean drama is now fast becoming the best in the business. Flawless .
846,Squid Game,"OUTSTANDING...Well after knowing about the hype I decided to watch it on weekend and now I am empty, speechless.The performance from main lead was so satisfying and real, the concept was creative and allow imagination, this is what we called perfect mind-boggling cinema and episode 6 will going to stay there for a long long time....
Must watch...."
847,Squid Game,"A fantastic tale of a group of humans, laden with debt, play games in the hope of winning cash prize.Great acting, interesting plot glues you to the series, from start to end.This is not just another play a game of death story.Squid game definitely raises the bar on drama and story telling."
848,Squid Game,I loved most of the series but I think the end of this first season made no sense. Why the red hair color? He wanted the money to be a good father but when he won it feels like he completely forgot about his daughter... I really disliked the way the handle the end.
849,Squid Game,This show is violent and there is a lot of death in it.But it is compelling and well shot.Don't speak Korean so I cannot comment on the translations or the voice acting of dub people.
850,Squid Game,"I enjoyed Squid Game but feel it's rather overrated. I've been a big fan of far eastern and in particular Japanese and Korean movies for many years. Lady Vengeance and Oldboy in particular stuck with me. So many people have been talking about Squid Game, I was expecting a little bit more. When you know there are twists, even ones you don't expect, they don't really come as a surprise."
851,Squid Game,Turned off on the preview - the VIPs were that bad.
852,Squid Game,"Season 1 rated 8. 7 if they make another.This series expresses an aspect of Korean movie culture, which wants to show people in their worst poor helpless stateA recent Korean movie got so famous, and it showed how people live in home of others without getting detected. Similar kind of movies are something that Korean society seems to enjoy. Watch the destituteness helplessness of urban poor. It is not the VIPs that are making this game play and them enjoying it. It the well feed society of Korea that wants to enjoy others with lesser means of survival in our present capitalistic society getting ripped off the basic necessities for living. America has done it's part of making a society completely opposite of communist North. Completely filled with big shopping heaven, richness, laviousness, go to place to have plastic surgeries, so and soAsk yourself, what society would it be where large crowd would gather in a colosseum to watch gladiators killing each others right in front. People killing each other, getting killed and there it just one survivor. How cruel it is.Series showed that this game is played for many decades.. Seriously.. no flaws in it? Wasn't there Korean Bruce Lee or Rambo to save the day? All this years and no one detected it? Every year 455 dying on this earth and police didn't know or attempted to catch them?Rule of the game is if anyone wants to quit the game they will be eliminated. So don't people should know that elimination means being killed? It's only after round 1 does people know about it. Rules should be in essence clear and not be coded or with a duel meaning. Rule of rules is not followed. Round 1 was with so many unnecessary killings.One day before I read in news of best and topmost reputation from UK, that this series is getting more and more liked across nations. But there main topic in the news was that the English subtitles are not doing good justice to the excellent Korean dialogue. Again seriously.. Why would a English knower will be bothered about minor translation loss or miscommunication. We are watching it more then actually reading subtitles line by line. Many Korean who knows English well enough have to say this about subtitles. How will it affect? By getting better appreciation? Answer from me is no!Apart from it, the best thing is the setup of the games and the rooms. It seems that set production was one excellent piece of work. Perfection in the making feel that that's where a game should be played. The colors the dresser the clean act except of course by VIPs.I enjoyed the series but I am sorry, the meaning of Korean movie culture shows an aspect that is darker then one may think."
853,Squid Game,"Things I LOVED: the music, the cinematography, the writing, the story, the metaphors. It was really good!Things that I didn't love: the ending, the actors playing the VIPs (so bad in comparison to the main characters that it watered down the other actors' performances) and the hand feeding of things that we are supposed to remember. The fun is realizing you remember on your own!I still recommend watching obviously!"
854,Squid Game,"If you have nothing else to do then give it a try.The characters are a cliche, the story is the same old good evil greed narrative, the concept is ok and the cop-brother storyline is just boring.It reminded me of Gantz! They could have added some elements from the anime and make it better. It would have been a good mix.Overall, 6/10.Take your popcorn, your drinks, your chicken wings and enjoy."
855,Squid Game,"For me, the first few episodes was a definite 8 in my books. But it started to be a bit boring and predictable in the last couple episodes. The glass game did not feel like an old children game. A new take on hopscotch perhaps. When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn't get Frontman's motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds. I guess setting the narrative this way opens the possibility of a season 2.I get the high ratings and hype, but beneath it all its a not-too-bad series worthy of a 6."
856,Squid Game,"This is everything wrong with modern film-making. The whole thing lacks any logical sense, it drags on for way too long, the games are moronic and unimaginative, the characters are shallow, there is not even an attempt at creating some nuance and emotion, I would have more compassion watching chicken die than this absolutely ridiculous man-slaughter. The main character is this completely unremarkable John battered by life that only occasionally yells angrily at the world. All of it is just one huge waste. If you get a thrill of seeing people dye on screen for no reason, all decorated in ridiculous settings and surrounded with PlayStation-like mask people, go for it though. It's literally that, nothing more."
857,Squid Game,...would have been more intimidating if their cylinders had been loaded!
858,Squid Game,To be honest I have only watched two episodes. Reminds me of Parasite- the crazy disregard for human life. I will continue to watch it- am having a hard time with the gore.
859,Squid Game,"I'm obsessed because its amazing show. However...sometimes it has a little weird 'feeling'. Somethings off. Maybe its the eng dabing, that make it 'overacted'. I wish I was fluent in Korean, I'd enjoy it more.. but dont get me wrong it was AMAZING. The first game, the marbles... I really cant wait for the second season..🦑"
860,Squid Game,"I am not an amateur to be fooled by ratings, flashy reviews and mainstream opinion, I watch a series/movie with an unbiased mind and judge it accordingly, this was just trash, Ep1-3 were somehow good, but in a very ordinary way, after that, utmost piece of crap, completely overrated with hundreds of stupidity...What was with the last fighting scene? Three stabs, one to the leg, one to the stomach and another one right through his hand, and he is still standing and fighting, while one bite on the ankle, and the other guy is done, what the hell?The cop and his frontman brother, what was that about? Extremely irrelevant and added absolutely nothing to the story, just what was the whole point of it except just wasting time?And don't get me started with the VIP's, just duh....Long story short, watch the hunger games...."
861,Squid Game,"Stylish, graphic and enjoyable. The lead character got on my nerves but hey ho. The whole film has a great style both visually and musically. It somehow reminded me of Clockwork Orange. Watch it and see.Others have gone into it but the whole style sticks with you and the game scenes are what you would hope for. Some great things coming out of South Korea of late. Train to Busan is a great example. A must see."
862,Squid Game,"Very disturbing with grotesque violence. Poor acting, poor story. Why that hell were the 'supposedly good guys' feeling sorry for themselves when they voluntarily rejoined the games - the killings, deaths were inevitable but the main guy still wanted the moral high ground. Just a poor, very disturbing show, with all the grotesque violence and a poor ending. The main character only went back for the money, he knew in order to win others have to die. But now, he doesnt want to use the money and is annoyed at the killings - you cant have it both ways mate!!!. Please save your time and life and don't bother watching this show."
863,Squid Game,"Awesome combination of Drama, suspense, thrill & A small demo of today's World.Must watch, its fictional but I'll give you some true life lessons, who is your friend, who is your enemy."
864,Squid Game,"I was skeptical of the show since it had so much hype, but it was an amazing show by far. This show will keep you entertained almost the whole way through. The only part i wish wasn't in it was the vips they contributed nothing imo. Other than that this show was the bomb."
865,Squid Game,"This series was overated by viewer, try to watch this and Believe me this series was just typical korean movie. Too much drama. Like every korea movie, life conflict, problem blah blah...you expect this in any korean movie."
866,Squid Game,Acting- great! Story- great! Fun-Tons of fun!!!! I loved this!!!!!!!! I wonder if there will be another season. Either way I enjoyed every episode. I'm trying not o give spoilers but I really really enjoyed this show. Directing and set was great. All the actors did a phenomenal job. Kudos to the Director. Great storytelling!!!!
867,Squid Game,One of best series I have ever watched. The story is so simple but effective and extraordinary. The games are so relatable yet bloody dangerous. That old man is the heart of this story. There are lots of things you can relate in your daily life with this story. Outstanding.
868,Squid Game,The show is decent although the 3 last episodes could've been better but I still enjoyed the action and the storyline.
869,Squid Game,This show was good better than most shows nowadays. The story in general was good with some nices twists near the end and left us with unanswered questions.
870,Squid Game,"This seems to be popular only because of the recent hype around Korean pop. Good idea but poorly executed, the series has some flashes of brilliance but is overrall weighed down by the poor dramatization. Discussing the VIPs is a waste of time."
871,Squid Game,"It is quite hard to review the whole series . Because each episode gives a unique portrait .The idea is good old fashion Japanese way with some new modern technology. The main concept is well demonstrate. My best moment is at the last one, when the main hero and a old man playing games weather the homeless guy will get help or not.The rich see the world in another sense. But the life goes on inhuman way towards the poor people. This series gives some visual, good concept , business and class exploitation with Japanese work culture. Among 9 episode the 3 episodes are good. Over all good for nice time pass."
872,Squid Game,"This show was nothing like what i expected. When I saw the the trailer , it made me to watch squid game so bad . The directed and the screenplay writer are the best ... The graphics , the twists , the games , wow !! , I am blown up by this show .. Tbh this would be my fav show of all time ..."
873,Squid Game,Overhyped series.This is just an average series nothing more.I don't know why so much hype about the series.Looks. Like a marketing gimmick by Netflix.
874,Squid Game,"This is the bravest, most intelligent show I've seen in years, absolutely blown away by the thoughtfulness in the script. There's so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.The first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that's known as debt. It uses the the Korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. This makes watching the series so much more relatable.Another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. The depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a Hollywood film. I personally felt the pain for the father.The fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. Ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. Nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.Overall, I feel this series is deep and thought provoking. It blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. Though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. So, spare a thought for someone around you who's in financial needs and offer them some help. I think that's the message from the filmmakers."
875,Squid Game,"What could I say about this overly budgeted piece of horrid excuse of a series. The story isn't very original, the plot and dialogue are very dull, boring and just bad. The most thrilling part of an episode is when it ends. The characters are unoriginal and poorly acted. I could go on but I will not be tearing my eyes out anymore and waste another thought with this.If someone can enjoy this I would like to know what it is that makes this even barely something to waste time on. If there's something good about this it is the cinematography. Some scenes were well shot and granted the feeling of some of it being real. Although when the props were involved, that ""joy"" faded away faster than it began and made it impossible to ever feel immersed to the world.Unwatchable. Wouldn't recommend."
876,Squid Game,An absolute thriller! The comedy gets you off guard even in the midst of a nail biting story! Enjoyed it.
877,Squid Game,"Wow he seemed clueless. And selfish before the game, then somewhat unselfish during, unless it suited him. But it would have been nice to have a smarter lead character."
878,Squid Game,Still I can't call it original and it kind of missed making a point. Left me with mixed thoughts about what was the author's purpose. And a second season?! Seriously? Definitely I will not watch another.
879,Squid Game,"Starts off interesting, but quickly becomes burdened with annoying characters and overly drawn out episodes. In the end I found it be completely boring."
880,Squid Game,"The series feels inspired by the Hunger Games. However, it is average when compared to it. I am a little surprised by the hype as it is not massively original. It started exciting; I was hooked initially, then sometimes I found the pace was a little slow.Overall, it's an excellent show, but undoubtedly not one of the greatest when you look at the ratings. It is not as memorable as you may think. I guess the fact that voices were dubbed on Netflix made it more enjoyable.Great show overall."
881,Squid Game,"This is fantastic! I watched the version dubbed in English, and it felt natural, not forced. Such a cool story, each episode is exciting and good fun. People have said they don't like the VIPs acting, but I think it's appropriate for those characters to have no real depth, they're supposed to be superficial people. Have a watch for an ace fun series, I watched the lot over a couple of nights :D."
882,Squid Game,"Is this original? To play a game and having your life at risk? No.Go and watch ""The Cube"", ""Saw"", Hunger Games "",... etc.It started ok, but i think it lacked an original ending. Having a rich guy betting on people life's was an expected ending. The movie ""Hostel"" already touched this point, having people kidnapped to allow the rich to kill them.. ""entertain the rich in a sadistic way"".Each episode nothing new appeared, more and more stupid kid games... just got worse.Season 2 will be just rewind and repeat with diff people and diff games (don't expect anything new)"
883,Squid Game,"An enjoyable watch, but personally I liked Alice in Borderland from last year better. Very similar idea, but more interesting games and characters.In squid game nothing really unexpected happened.And the dinner in the end reminded me very much of hunger games- which as well has more or less the same story.But all together still very solid an a 7 for me."
884,Squid Game,"Maybe ""Train to Busan"" spoiled me with its naturalistic performances, but this series seems proud of characters that scream every line and act so over-the-top and hammy that it's ridiculous. I've sampled both the original Korean version as well as the English dubbed version, and both are equally guilty. Some of the leads are better than others, of course, but the hams overshadow them, making this feel oddly amateurish in places."
885,Squid Game,"Big fuss in Greece with that show. After watching the last episode, i still can't understand why. Because it was something new and different? Because it was Korean? Who knows.It was watchable and that is the end of it imo.Battle Royale & Hunger Games all over again.8,1 is waaaaay too high guys."
886,Squid Game,"It's OK, there are some story-holes, which are probably in place because they want to make a second season. All in all it has an appealing (sometimes comic) korean movie aesthetic, but I liked Kung Fu Hustle (2004) much better."
887,Squid Game,"I don't really get all the hype. This is far from a masterpiece in any way, but it's entertaining. It's a little bit like Prison Break, lots of flaws but entertaining. The concept is really nothing new, just a rehash of the Hunger Games (which was pretty much a blatans rip-off of Battle Royale) and the acting sometimes reminds you of silent movies from a hundred years ago. Maybe that's a cultural thing though, I don't know, but Parasite didn't suffer from this. Never the less it brings you out of the story.I really wish it was as good as it's hyped up to be because I really like the concept. I feel the same way about this as I felt about Hard Target when that came out: ""Why film did you have to let me down?!"""
888,Squid Game,"This is first Korean TV show I watched. I'll be honest, If the internet wasn't so full of it, I wouldn't watch it at all. It was something new, nothing like I saw before. It's interesting, but some moments were very cruel, but in the same time frames were so multicolor, that the show was not so depressed. The main idea of the show I liked."
889,Squid Game,For the most part this show was excellent ... intriguing and different it kept me coming back to see how it would end . The filming and editing weren't always great and don't get me started on some of the acting but all in all I enjoyed the first 8 episodes . The end was the problem ... the last episode was a major snooze fest and don't see how this show can have a 2nd season .
890,Squid Game,First going into this I was hesitant it seemed like a typical portrayal of an indebted person doing anything to be free however it just kept getting better each episode. Every character was very important to how the story progresses and the acting was phenomenal expect for when the VIPs arrived. I really hope they decide to continue the show for a second season.
891,Squid Game,So far this tv is muck. Avoid. Absolute rubbish. Watch something else or just go for a walk. Can't understand all the hype. Totally a waste of my time.
892,Squid Game,"Even while deliberately turning my brain off some blunders were too glaring to ignore (namely the VIPs, who were an insult to the main cast). Even so, seeing the internet collectively enjoy and meme a piece of media makes me happy. You could also say I was in love with Sang-woo, so that contributes to my overall rating..."
893,Squid Game,"Good show, great 6th episode...but the best on TV history like some reviewers said??? Cmon, there is been a hype in the last years that people is saying the last TV show they just end watching is the GOAT. Those reviews are biasing the ratings on IMDB. It is Ok not to score 10 on a review....."
894,Squid Game,"If you want to know what the Global Elites & Central Planners think of you.As well as what the ""VIPs"" find entertaining in manipulating the plebs & playing with their lives - this is a great pseudo-documentary!"
895,Squid Game,"Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality ,honesty,sacrifice,smartness,cunningness and so on.This series is definitely worth your time and will hook you up to watch the season at a single stretch."
896,Squid Game,"I get the hype around this series, I just don't agree with it.It's about a game that consists of multiple kids games. If you win one of those games, you go to the next round, but if you lose, you die. The person who wins the last game gets all the money.The plot is basic and unoriginal. I feel like everyone can come up with it and it reminds me of a lot of other films I've already seen.The worst thing about it, is that it's too predictable. I could already tell who would die and who would win after watching the first episode. That made it not exciting of course, because I was never scared for people to die. There were plot twists, but they just didn't surprises me and it wasn't as emotional as people said it was. I haven't shed a single tear, while I normally cry a whole ocean when I watch a simple Disney film.I'm not saying this is the worst thing ever, maybe it just isn't for me. I don't regret watching it, but I'm not waiting for a second season either."
897,Squid Game,There were no squids in this series. The title clearly mentions squids. But there are no squids? Very disappointing and somewhat misleading. Why is it called the Squid Games if there aren't any squids in the show?
898,Squid Game,"This show started with great screenplay and emotions , after watching first episode I didn't stop it excited to see, when the 5th game starts its totally collapsed and boring games it dragged to 9 episodes jst 8 episodes or enough
I were really disappointed with that poor finish literally I didn't like it started like horrible and ended like smooth
But it's a decent watch let's hope they can comeback in season 2 strong."
899,Squid Game,"Superb show if you watch till end. Because the suspense, that who is behind all that and why these games are happening, we understand.It's little bit slow series but we all have to watch this series above 18 ages.Wating for season 2......"
900,Squid Game,"Literally had to stand up from my coach and pace, it's so intense and very well done!"
901,Squid Game,"Episode 1 starts off a bit too slow but towards the end things get interesting. Episode 2 to 7 is amazing and provides something a bit different from what we've seen in the past year or so.Episode 8 and 9 are terrible, they don't make any sense! I really don't want to include too many spoilers in this review.Overall, we'll done to the main characters. The acting was amazing!!!!"
902,Squid Game,"Interesting plot with an anxiety enducing tone. While I think the show declines a bit in quality towards the end, it's still a series I very much enjoyed."
903,Squid Game,"You can take out the second episode of the show and still have the same story. Does it matter that the detective has breached the ranks of the squidlords? No
Does it matter that they showed us why every (main) character is going back in? No, theres 2 episodes that it 'matters' and its the finale and the infamous marbles episode. And by 'matters' i mean that it's mentioned. For example in the marbles episode: ""PLEASE I CANT DIE I HAVE ---""
""SORRY I CANT HELP YOU I ALSO HAVE --- AND ---""
thats it
does the background for the characters in THIS episode matter? Lol high hopes
does the background for the overly dramatic villain matter at all? Why would it
the finale is the worst, the two spartans that make it out just go sicko mode in the head and just make anakong and obi-wong battle at the end without the actual emotion
if you want to watch this episode just watch the 4th and 5th episode and skip the parts with the doctor, it doesnt matter."
904,Squid Game,"The show is really entertaining because of the concept. It starts out great, maybe 9/10 through first 6 episodes. So much excitement and the concept of the games was a great idea. Then from 7th episode and on it just tanks. Bad writing, not as much suspense and boring final episode."
905,Squid Game,"Awesome.VIPs tho, so dumb. Horrible voices, line delivery, and acting. Would have been better if they said nothing at all. It was like they were all doing bugs bunny impersonations. Horrible."
906,Squid Game,"The only good part of it is the music played before the game being, which is stolen from Hunger Games. Including the megaphone effect."
907,Squid Game,"I won't give anything away, but the last 10 mins made no reasonable sense. It should have ended the way it started to after he right to the bank and not how it did after his haircut. Ep 6 is the first time is a long time I got sad watching a show. It was pretty shocking how I felt. Normally shows don't make me feel sad. But overall, I loved it. Great show. It took me a few times to try and watch the first 2 Eps, but I made it to the end. Enjoy!"
908,Squid Game,"It is hard to understand how or why a show like this got the Green Light (pun intended). The only characters that seem believable, or even remotely interesting, are the ones that are NOT involved with the ""game"".If this is the #1 show on Netflix at the moment then I strongly suggest that someone test the water supply."
909,Squid Game,"This show is probably the best example that popularity doesn't equate to quality as neither the premise nor the content is new it's just too many people are talking about it so it's very popular as there are many shows and movies like that, for ex: Alice in borderland, As in gods will and both are japanese and another japanese movie Battle Royale, also playing a survival game doesn't scream innovative as i went in with the hype just to be entertained and had no new experience."
910,Squid Game,"There are some good things to say about this show: good actors, good cinematography, some good ideas.But these smokes and mirrors hide the main flow: no soul. Everything there is too engineered to feel real. When hundreds of people stand, they distribute evenly in the space. When hundreds fire, their bodies are scattered evenly in the field. When a vote is made, the distribution between Yes and No is kept evenly until the last one that looks like he just realized he needs to think about it - for suspense. The bad guys are total Nazis, the good guys are banal, similar too much to others as in the Hunger Games.This is a show engineered to make us excited, and like the players looking at the huge piggy bank we swallow it eagerly."
911,Squid Game,"Boring, predictable, a bad copy of hunger games, also a stinker, and Saw...kinda liked the first one... I think.The acting is appalling, especially Gi-hun or whatever his name is whose only quality is to overcome his own stupidity when one already thinks that's impossible ... I would never tire of hammering his face.It's easily in the top 5 of the worst series I've ever seen. Lost 9 hours of my life to this rubbish, just to understand why people like it...even failed at that
I prefer to sit in in a park and watch the grass grow ... much more satisfying and entertaining."
912,Squid Game,"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people."
913,Squid Game,Overrated. Over long. Tedious. I've never sat through such rubbish in my life. Seriously. I cant even think of 150 characters of review to put here. Would have made a great 90 minute movie.
914,Squid Game,"That is the best way I can describe this. Once you get the concept early on, it is clear where everything is headed, but not in a way that ruins anything.There are characters you really like and some you really hate. I was good with this throughout until the last episode or two. That's when both engines seem to lose power and the yellow masks drop down.I don't know if they are trying to make room for a season two, but what sent this into a spiral was that some characters are so stupid they don't even realize how stupid they are, even when someone tells them very clearly that they are stupid. On top of stupidity, there is this self-righteousness that is unbearable. It is amazing how oblivious people can be to their own hypocrisy.So, in summary, fun to watch but you just need a shower when it is over. One strong point is how well it nails the depths of man's selfishness and human behavior in general."
915,Squid Game,"First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It's been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That's where they hit their stride.This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn't offended by it, I just felt it didn't serve the story or stay authentic.I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don't actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he's behind it. That's a fine ""twist"", but my God, his ""explanation"" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn't killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It's the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn't as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn't feeling that.And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you're a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn't that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I'm going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to ""escape"" on. I guess that's another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the ""rules"" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn't a huge fan of that.All in all, it was good, but could have been great."
916,Squid Game,"Great acting,solid script,a fresh taste. Definitly worth watching.Really makes you wonder,is it really different in real life?There are millions of people literally dying from hunger and diarrhea. Not 465,millions. There are enough food,resource,medicine for all humankind but we don't want to share or we simply don't care. Like 10 richest people in the world could fed millions of people if they want to,but they don't. We,people of the world,could improve the standards of life for them very easily ,but we don't care. We simply don't. No need to lie.So if you think this is a distopia,it's not. It is reality,just more bloody or let's put it this way,you have to watch them die because you have to,not like in real world.VIP acting is a mess though. ;)"
917,Squid Game,"Squid game is a good addition to Netflix library. The Korean show is dark and gritty. The plot is fresh and exciting and it builds up nicely to the finale.The acting by the complete cast was great. There was no let up by the actors in their challenging roles.I would have loved an extra episode delving into more details such as background, more history about the game. Also felt the plot was too revealing at times.But overall a great watch."
918,Squid Game,All netflix show is over rateoverrated and overrate.
919,Squid Game,"I am not one to follow the hype train usually but I just finished watching this and I have to say if you haven't seen this one then you're missing out! The way it grips you from the very start and doesn't let go is something to be applauded. Without spoiling anything all I can talk about is how the show made me feel... it is brutal and I am not talking about the violence. Part psychological drama, part social commentary and filled with twists and turns this one is not one to miss!"
920,Squid Game,"It's pretty unreal how shallow-minded many of the reviewers are here. They are griping about the acting. It's nothing short of brilliant, and very much representative of the Korean style. If those people watched Old Boy or Parasite, they would immediately realize the strength and potency of it, and how it plays well into the dimensions of the characters and the plot threads that surround them.The sudden outbursts and taciturn restraint from the main and side characters are a mixture of subtlety and overreaching. It's a delightful balance here. It's also refreshing to see this instead of the atrociously mundane acting, like say in Clickbait where the actors are overly restrained so they can look attractive for the camera.This series is immensely intriguing. Listen closely for the nuances of emotion even behind the masks. Kudos to the producers and writers for being bold and for - after ten years - getting this series put onto the small screen for us to relish in with giddy delight thanks to their tenacity with Netflix."
921,Squid Game,"This is a fantastic show through the 3rd episode. It is mysterious, it will tickle your sci-fi bone as well. It's gory so if you aren't into that pass on this. I love what Korea and Japan are producing right now!"
922,Squid Game,This show has it all. The English dubbed version is a bit cheesy but it's acceptable. The show itself is gory so if that's not your thing don't watch. It is heart wrenching. I wasn't expecting this.
923,Squid Game,"I would have given 9 but I am disappointed after the episode 7. Every thing was good until VIPs arrived.Slow pacing, and I got hurt when that person rejected his prize money after this struggle. Just wow🤐 All this for nothing."
924,Squid Game,Far too long for a plot that only stole some ideas from Cube or Saw. Poor acting and boring dialogues. Please avoid this one!
925,Squid Game,"The show started of great, but after episode 4 it went downhill really fast. In the last episodes i was allmost confused if i was watching a Korean serie or a Mexican telenovel. Don't even get me started with rhe vips. And the agent looking for his brother was a bit to obvious for me who his brother turned out to be. As well as the old man and his death. A possible great show got crinchy and predictable the last episodes."
926,Squid Game,"I liked Squid Game, it's refreshing to watch something of this genre besides all the overload of romcoms and other shallow programs that are offered. The camerawork, settings, acting is wonderful (minus the foreign VIPS, oh my god I really hope Korea stops casting those wannabe caucasion actors, cuz they can't act even if their life depends on it, cringe level 1000!)A few minus points: the white actors (VIPS) as mentioned above. Also, the pace is really slow. And A LOT of things were very predictable. Sometimes I was just plain bored, and that isn't a good thing if it's a thriller/suspense genre series, right?Overall there were somewhat interesting characters and a few good moments about bonds, but still, there was something lacking. I wasn't shocked or on the verge of tears when someone died or when a emotional scene happened. Also, the main character was unlikable. He showed a great ethic belief during the games, but then he didn't show much growth (after the games he's still a good for nothing loser).Alice in Borderland on the other hand, has more fantasy elements, but a fast pace combined with unusual turns of events that makes you really sit on the edge of your seat.Last, but not least: please watch it in the original audio (Korean) with subtitles. DON'T watch it dubbed. Don't be lazy cuz you'll have to read subtitles, because firstly, it's not a big deal, and secondly, you'll miss so much emotion, humor and whatnot if you watch dubbed versions (of anything, really). SUB > DUB."
927,Squid Game,I normally hate watching dubbed movies and tv but this was definitely worth it.I don't know if it's the story writing or the visuals but I was hooked after the 1st episode. Great show and even better if you go into it thinking the subtitles will annoy you.
928,Squid Game,Main character is completely unlikeable by the end of the story. Other than that the show is awesome with the games and side characters.
929,Squid Game,Often tough to watch but a gripping series if you can see it out.
930,Squid Game,You already know how this show is. A masterpiece. 10/10.
931,Squid Game,"From the unique sets to the engaging story line, this movie had us totally engaged and hoping for a new season. Kudos to the screenwriters, actors, and set decorators."
932,Squid Game,"Listen, having my eardrums busted with the hype surrounding this show I thought I'd give it a go! Authentic yes but there's only so much bloodshed before it becomes a bore. If you've got a few hours to kill give it a shot, overrated, would not be in my top 20 series - box sets!"
933,Squid Game,"This series is phenomenal, cruel, big tension and a lot of sad moments. The series also reminds me of the movies called Hostel ( ""the horror ones"") but those films are like a concept if you watch Squid Game, it is like they copied your homework and made it 1000 times better."
934,Squid Game,"Definitely watch this! After the first episode I was absolutely glued to the programme, I watched 5 episodes in one go, it was that good.Personally I preferred to watch it in the original language Korean with English subtitles, I believe it makes the programme much more believable.The American dubs were just awful.Fantastic acting by all. It has 2 brilliant twists at the end too!Enjoy!"
935,Squid Game,I am speechless..really Awesome show. Every character development is great.mindblowing web series. Best show of the year.we need second session of this series.
936,Squid Game,"If Saw met the Hunger games this would be the result, it's a show that proves that the wreckless & relentless pursuit of money may not necessarily leave you with the result you desire after all is said & done."
937,Squid Game,"Yes the show was super entertaining and had you engrossed, and might even go on to become Netflix's most watched show, but for viewers who have seen enough cinema, there was nothing ground breaking here.The overall plot about rich people being bored so using poor people for entertainment - that's been done. The final revelation the old man gave was quite cliched.What was the point of the entire sub plot with the cop looking for his brother? He turns out to be the main guard, but so what? That seemed quite a pointless chase.Half the games were quite boring to be honest.As enough people have mentioned here, the VIPs were a shocker. It was quite expected that the games were being funded by a crew of rich bored people for entertainment, but those actors and their dialogue gets a 0/10.Still, the show had great acting and fun characters, but the plot could have been WAY tighter."
938,Squid Game,"Conceptually interesting and visually engaging. Horrible plot where there is no background for most things. Subpar acting. The scenes of the actual games are fun, but other than that, nothing in this lazily executed series makes sense."
939,Squid Game,"The marble episode is simply gratuitous. There is no reason for it to be as drawn out as it is, and there is no reason to not simply imply instead of showing the deaths. Anyone who likes this episode is simply sadistic.Beyond that, the ending two episodes don't meet what one would expect from a story. Basically, you get a cliff-hanger that is misanthropic. The old man is upset that people are killing each other and he preaches about life to the main character, yet he's the force behind all of the deaths?And what about the religion that's brought in? Why go after religion when it doesn't matter to the plot?After the marble episode, I only finished the series because I thought there might be something upcoming to redeem the story. I was wrong to expect that kind of intelligent writing.This is a mess; don't waste your time."
940,Squid Game,"Enough said. (This review must contain at least one hundred and fifty characters. So I need to write more. O.k. Too much talking, not enough action. Unrealistic dialog and behaviour. There is no building on earth in which the air vents could support the full weight if a human. Stupid."
941,Squid Game,Enjoyed it. It did get boring at some points but definitely highlighted the issues in the society. It will be interesting to see what they bring out in season 2...
942,Squid Game,"I really don't know how people can't love this series. Mixture of emotions like; anger, sad, happy, sympathy etc... And an amazing plot twist. Really wish the season 2 doesn't ruin it."
943,Squid Game,"It's nothing but something that kids who love playing gore-type, violent video games. No interesting story, just boring predictable scenes. Bad acting, cinematography is a joke. Watch it and you'll easily forget it in few seconds after."
944,Squid Game,"Acting, Directing, Production Design, Score, Writing we're all phenomenal. I minus 0.5 because the VIP's sounds so textbook and cringe."
945,Squid Game,Its amazing. Just stop reading reviews and start watching now.
946,Squid Game,"When I first watched squid game, my standards weren't that high. However, it exceeded my standards and is up there with my top 3 favourite TV shows.I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the interesting concept. The games were well designed and intense to watch and SOME characters you can relate with.I think Squid Game is probably near to as good as the Saw franchise.If you like Saw and survival movies, you should definitely watch, you won't regret it."
947,Squid Game,"Why giving rich people stupid ideas? Acting is so good, actors are very honest and Koreans are so beautiful, but the VIPs... it is so bad. Love for Wi Ha Jun."
948,Squid Game,Exciting Korean Series.My expectations were exceeded binged the season in one day..... oops! Can't wait for season two.That a series on Netflix can have such a global impression.
949,Squid Game,I stayed up till 4 AM watching this one. After seeing Squid Games i will be heading into a Korean Film binge watch. What a story where the elite rule the world. Hmmm could this be another case where the bank rollershave to shows us their intent before doing so?
950,Squid Game,"Like the movie parasite, the koreans have achieved fantastic ratings with mediocre productions. Everything about the squid game is mediocre to pretty good. Decent enough one time watch. Imdb ratings are so watered down these days."
951,Squid Game,"I'm really not understanding why this show is so popular. I'm half way through and only one of the primary characters is likeable. The main guy gambled away his life, including his relationship with his daughter. The women are whiny and annoying. The ""rivals"" are your classic vicious bullies. The only character I'm really rooting for is the Pakistani. The story might be interesting if they weren't all in there because of their own bad choices, but I'm just having a hard time getting through this series."
952,Squid Game,"I have not much to say about it, it would be a waste of time.Some years ago people read fifty shades of grey thinking it was literature, now they watch this pretending it is cinematography.They were both made to amuse naives with primitive instincts.P.s. Do not watch this while eating. Actually do not watch this at all. It's pointless.Edit : Having been sick with fever and stuck to bed I managed to watch through the whole series. (I guess this was the only way to go through the episodes) Having done so I'll have to change my original 1-star rating to 8-star because some significant points were made later in the series, concerning human nature, which were thought provoking and I actually found interesting. Still believe that it is gross though and not suitable for the faint hearted or those that can't bear the sight of blood or actually any kind of sensitive and/or sensible person. They will feel disgusted. But conclusively I don't regret watching it."
953,Squid Game,"Overrated!I can't believe we live in a world where people can't see the difference between ''quality'' and ''polished''.This show has only one reason of being popular and it's the ''memes''. That's all.Horrible acting, mediocre directing, cliche story with terrible dialogs, forced drama...When i first watched the original ''bad'' Japanese movie of ''Squid Game'', i at least had fun. It was bad but it was fun.But this is just bad all over."
954,Squid Game,"The storyline is familiar. We have seen this before. From the original Battle Royale to the Hunger games, and the most recent Alice in Borderland.What makes the Squid game stand out is definitely the character development of the main characters. You got to know them, you hate them, you feel sorry for them, you love them;+ Great acting from the actors and actresses.+ I like the games, not complicated but simple recognizable games.+ different from others we got an undercover police man in the staff of the game. This was refreshing to see the other side and not only focusing on the characters in the game. And the guy who is playing the undercover is an eyecandy to watch.Less enthusiastic about:
some predictable plots, like the main character will survive till the end.somehow I knew the frontman was the brother of the undercover police man, but why and how did he end up as the frontman?-the VIPS, please delete their part. Terrible fake acting.the final episode, of course they finish with the squid game, but It was not so excited like the previous games. Also towards the end was disappointing.Fun fact
The main character resembles Hong Kong actor Sean Tam."
955,Squid Game,"Starts slow, then you get the shock. Acting is so bad its beyond corny. Lots of shock and blood.So, even tho it's not a great film or story, once you start, you have to finish to see who wins!Spoiler alert! At the end there are some surprises!"
956,Squid Game,"This series would deserve a solid 9, except for the fact that's it contains 3 pathetic and unacceptable flaws.As high-caliber that each episode and the storyline was, it went majorly downhill in Episode 7 with the portrayal of the VIPs. The show's portrayal of idiotic Americans takes the viewer right down to an uncomfortable level at how ridiculously these characters were expected to be. Even if they were attempting to make them seem stupid, it made the show pretty cringe-worthy from how well it had developed up until that point. It quickly went downhill at the introduction of these characters.Finally, the ending of the final ""game"" played in the show was really dumb and lacked redemption in the characters' development. As well as, the ending of the film and it's dialogue leading up to it.I was going to knock off 3 points for the above 3 mentioned failures, but wanted to be generous with a final rating if 7 (reduced from what could have been a 9, had they not messed up this show so badly). Overall, the show was excellent - until it was not - with its horrible conclusion.As good as this show was for most of it, the ending completely destroyed it, making me wonder ""What was the point of watching this?"" It is unbelievable that a show that was written and acted so well, turned into something sloppy at the end that could have been written much better. It's as if someone different who had no idea what the story was, wrote the final episode.I recommend watching it for 85% of the show. If you're not attached to having a properly explainable and redemptive ending, then you may love the whole thing."
957,Squid Game,"It was an awesome series, multiple games, thrill, suspense, violence..
Credit goes to cinematic editor.The old man story was awesome. It would be better if at the end there should be clip of daughter of main character ( Hero )"
958,Squid Game,"Stays true to the high production standards that Korean film and TV have been producing in the last 20 odd years. Engaging narrative which is both simple enough for a mass audience, yet intriguing enough to keep the diehards guessing. 8/10."
959,Squid Game,"I got caught in the gushing for this series so couldn't wait to watch it.Bitterly disappointed to be honest, so many plot holes that really distract from a good if not great premise.The ending is incredibly poor I won't say more as I don't want to spoil it for you but honestly don't get your hopes up."
960,Squid Game,"Just read most of reviews. Most of users like VIPs, criticising last 3 episode and providing bad rating.Ok VIP's dialogues and acting are pathetic but you can not deny Squid Game has fantastic story with suspense and screenplay. So don't think like that and you should not provide rating below 7. It started well and middle of suspense also enough to stick with show.Those people who are expecting more then they just like VIPs and they don't have satisfaction and fun in their's life. Whatever you provide they always say 'no this is not enough'.Mark my word those users also want to organize kind of this game and find some fun ... ha ha ha."
961,Squid Game,"Except for the VIPs acting and their embarrassing ""jokes"" - coughs *69,96* - Squid Game is one of the best shows ever being perfectly engaging and exciting."
962,Squid Game,"This is so overhyped its untrue. 4/10Here's the reality, without spoilers (not that there us that much to spoil). This is just so derivative of other series, be they far eastern or western and so there really was very little original to talk about. Its basically just a gore fest with the excuse that its an anti capitalist message... yawn, done before and far better in many other productions. I really dont get what others are seeing that is original about it.This inevitably leads to there being something else needed to pull through and that typically means great characters or great effects. Sadly this really fails on the latter and doesnt really deliver on the former either,I have no issues with anti heros but if you have a full cast of them, then you've really gotta work saving graces in. There were ok, a couple of characters that werent completely abhorrent.I didnt find the acting particularly convincing from any of them, completely overdramatized interactions were the norm. That however could be as much the direction as the actor/actress.Also dont get me started on the sexism etc in this. I get annoyed at Holywood for the long term fad of trying to remove any masculinity from all things to the point of absurdity but that doesn't excuse things in the other direction, the chauvinism not just expressed by characters (which would be ok to a certain degree) but then underpinned by events in the show is just unacceptable and cost this show 2 stars in and if itself.Overall, I watched it through just to see where it went and it just remained pretty poor. I doubt I will bother with season 2, whatever the hype."
963,Squid Game,"Laughable acting and hilarious dialogue(in an unintentionally bad way), add English dubbing to this and you get Squid Game.The over use of violence just makes it even more dumber, there is absolutely nothing realistic in this movie, even Purge made more sense.Not sure how this gets such high ratings, Ed Wood has made better movies."
964,Squid Game,"""Squid game"" is a Korean mystery/thriller tv-series about a group of people selected to participate in a sinister game of survival.Every participant is selected because they are out of luck and in debt, and desperate enough to do what it takes to escape their fate in the outside world.We follow deadbeat dad and gambling addict Seong Gi-Hun, as he continue to fall into bottomless debt, and after a fateful late night gamble at the subway, gets an invitation to a final game where everything will change.What follows is a series of games, where the stakes are final if you lose, but the price is a chance to redeem yourself financially and for some, morally.The show is really nothing more, or less, than a solid script, with no forced finger pointing or animosity based on race or sex. There are assholes and villains, and there are good people, and people in between. Regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. There's no bigotry outside of that, which U. S. TV-shows are unable to write or make anymore.It's exciting, but there is a certain amount of over-acting and a bit of melodrama that can be somewhat grating to a western palate, but when the script is that good and engaging, it's easy enough to stomach. Other than the aforemented, the actors do a stellar job.It has some flaws of course. It's not groundbreaking or terribly original in it's constituant parts, but as a whole, it works perfectly fine for what it is.It's well shot, well paced, engaging, but with some overplaying that draws you out of the story a bit, as mentioned. Overall an enjoyable, exciting and somewhat gory and bloody good series, with added societal criticism and a message that doesn't label any specific demographic as inherently evil."
965,Squid Game,I loved the first 7 episodes which were fun and the acting was good till the last episode which was poorly written but you must watch this show. You will engage with my the main characters and the way the games are designed make them fun to watch.
966,Squid Game,"This creative new show, which has clearly been inspired by Karl Marx's genius work 'Das Capital', provides an up to date analysis of capitalism and its billions of victims.Hopefully it stays on track and doesn't fall victim to the very thing that it's critiquing."
967,Squid Game,"Well first of all, this is not a good show in any way.Stealing the concept from hunger games as one example.The acting is beyond bad.. So so bad.I recommend watching the japanese movie Battle royal instead. Thats the original with good story and good acting."
968,Squid Game,"It is very average and doesn't deserve all that hype. I'm sorry.😢😢
The first 3 episodes where engaging especially the first one. It went downhill from there."
969,Squid Game,Loved every episode. Give it a chance. Definitely not the same ol crud that gets pumped out over and over these days.
970,Squid Game,"Incredibly original and risky tv and not for the faint hearted. Dark, outrageous and ridiculously addictive. The only annoying thing was the terrible acting from the VIP Western actors. A real oversight on the casting but apart from that a great rollercoaster ride."
971,Squid Game,"Soo, in 2021 you want to make a tv show that will be seen all over the world. And you can do anything, be really creative. BUT, you decide to steal the trade mark of one of the biggest netflix shows of all time.Even if you didn't see, la casa de papel. You know their red suit and mask.Why would you do that? Even if the show turns out to be amazing, it's so emberassing. They don't feel ashamed? It's a joke."
972,Squid Game,"The idea of the show is interesting, but overall is really boring. I had to skip more than half of the show...
There are so weird things, like the actor who speaks with food in his mouth 20 minutes and he is not chewing the food. It's really disgusting.In general, the acting was really bad. Exagerated. Theatrical. I know that in asia this is kinda normal, but you can't take it seriously.And the most important thing. Why would you copy the famous trade mark of la casa de papel? They have almost the same jumpsuit, the guns and of course they have masks too. Embarrassing.Korean Hunger Games in La casa de papel costum. Copy-cat. ""Veeery creative"". Pathetic."
973,Squid Game,"This korean series is okay. It has pretty nice set designs and good cinematography. However the acting could definitely be stronger. The music is often pretty good, although some choices I personally found kinda odd. The story itself is nothing special and has been told in better and different ways."
974,Squid Game,2 episodes in and already hooked. It has basic concept that we have seen in other movies but Koreans know how to write unlike western writers. Characters get flushed out and you actually care about them. Acting is also really good (non of that cringy western actors). If you like well written thrillers definitely check this one out.
975,Squid Game,"Just read a review from a Korean speaker who says the translation of the dialogue is poor to say the least. That was one of biggest problems with this show. The English dialogue is awful. Painful.The acting is ok but there does tend to be a lot of stage, exaggerated acting in front of the camera. It is over the top. In particular from one of the central, female characters. The ""baddie"" just does stereotypical baddie.Central story is fine. Interesting at times. Sets are very good. Didn't like the ending. Don't why the writer thought that would be a better ending than just the winner's game comes to an end and then he witnesses the beginning of the next one.An alright show in my opinion but don't understand the hype."
976,Squid Game,"This TV series is so good I think mainly because it is relatable. I believe anyone who watches this will unconsciously put themselves in the situation of the players in the game. One of the reason it is also relatable is because the personalities of each character is different, consequently their approach to the game. Apart from that, mostly the emotions from watching this series will make you engage at every moment making you hooked at it."
977,Squid Game,"Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute. Squid Game has many interesting and unique elements trough out the show while showcasing our present reality and how cruel it may be, with a decent written script and great acting. The only cons about the show is defiently the VIP's acting and the ending. Would recommend."
978,Squid Game,"Whatever the many other virtues of this series, the violence and dwelling on blood and gore undermine it. I find it odd that squeamishness about showing physical love and nakedness can sit alongside a celebration of physical conflict, pain and injury."
979,Squid Game,"This show is very well done, the set design is absolutely stunning, the actors (main ones) are pretty good, the character development is great as well. Some great emotional moments throughout. Awesome practical effects as well. The only gripe I have with it is the addition of other certain characters (episode 7) that are just awfully done. Awful acting (can barely read their lines right), and some cringy dialogue from those characters. They also tried to make them comedic, which was totally out of the blue and weird. They reuse the same song over and over for most of the series. And for the love of god, stop making Korean actors speak English. It's extremely hard to act in your second language, and you can tell some of the actors have never said a word in English. It really takes you out of the immersion. Overall, it's a really good show and worth a watch 100%."
980,Squid Game,"Although there were logic errors and nonsense, the series was very gripping and did not lose its grip by making it interesting until the end. It was a quality production in general, but the ending was so unnecessary and ridiculous. Despite its shortcomings, it is an impressive series with its characters, drama and reaction. Especially the first game, ""red light, green light"", terrified the audience beautifully and reflected the traumaticity and drama, which is the theme of the series. Also, the series has been the voice of people suffering from economic difficulties. The things I love about the show are the characters, the good portrayal of emotions in the scenes, and the beautiful creative plot. So i love this show in general, i can give from 7,5/10 to 8/10. By the way, those VIP guys acting were sucks dude, i felt so cringe when they talk.. but in general, they all were good actors and actresses i think."
981,Squid Game,"Just binged watched 4 episodes in a row. Amazing!Extraordinarily original and fresh. There are some feelings of Old Boy, Parasite and Japan's Battle Royale, and of course hints of Black Mirror (the title graphics make that very clear) - but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.It's best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.I see a few here complaining about VIP acting, I have no clue what that is, but I found the acting overall very good.I don't speak Korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.Since it's mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.Let's face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average SAW-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. Subtle messaging abounds. For your consideration.The design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful Escher and Minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.With Star Wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. Under a hierarchy based on shapes and a Vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.And that's where the Old Boy feeling really kicks in. Is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?Overall, I would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you've found something you will absolutely love.Can't really say any more until I'm done watching it all.But I'm going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.Or it should be. Especially given the work gone into this.Thanks for reading."
982,Squid Game,"I knew who is who by the 3-4. Episode, but good characters and story. Exciting, thrilling, brutal, sensitive."
983,Squid Game,"Hands down maybe the best show I have ever seen, can't stop thinking about it!"
984,Squid Game,"I was hesitant to watch it at first because of all the hype surrounding it. But I gave in in the end and I'm so glad I did. Binge-worthy series. Original plot and highly entertaining. I was happy to rewatch it with my partner who was late to the party. Minus 1 star for the horrible acting from the VIPs. But it's ok, they're hardly in it and so thankful for that. The rest of the actors were great! The old man/ player #1 was my favourite and his character brought so much to the story. Great character development and story in general."
985,Squid Game,"The main ideas of the series is what money can buy in this world, what makes your life worth living, what is the cost of a human life. That is by itself a very good bunch of thesises to build up. But when I was watching this show, I always felt that person that was developing characters isn't suited for it at all. All the characters are very generic and cliched. At some point you could cling to them, feel some connection, root for them, the next minute you already feel sick of seeing them as they are being ruined for the sake moving the plot further. This is a typical battle-royal where you know that this exact character could die because he isn't written well enough and haven't got any screentime, but that other dude will certainly die because he's on your screen just because they need people for this kind of story.Having said that, there are still plenty of good moments (i.e. Episode ""Gganbu"" was really dramatic and this is great considering what I said above), very good quality of filming, interior of the scenes, costumes. Overall, this series is worth to watch, but beware of annoying stupidly written dialogues and poorly realised character progression. If you're okay with synopsis - go watch it! But that's not really any kind of masterpiece."
986,Squid Game,"A great narrative/concept which thrills the life out of any audience member. Despite Gi Sung being the primary protagonist there was always doubt in him due to the incompetence he had previously displayed. I genuinely thought Sang Woo would win as he showcased what a 'normal' person would do to live yet still related to us early on. In the games you would want to be Sang Woo, he is the most intelligent and is physically capable of passing the games and so you try to defend his choices until they devour you, similarly seen before with Walter White.However i do have a few issues with Squid Game.1. So the old man was behind it but wanted to get the thrill of playing. I jokingly guessed this as it seemed quite ridiculous. In the tug of war game he was inches away from dying but in the marble game where he actually lost, he lived anyway so the ""thrill"" he was talking about mustve been pretty pointless if he still had control.2. The detective sub plot is intriguing but the reveal is obvious and well... we don't exactly get closure as hes shot in the shoulder, oh... and he fell in water. He'll be perfectly fine for season 2 then.3. Gi Sung goes back to the games, abandoning his daughter and his character arc completion because he wants to know whos behind it? I thought we had concluded that it were just rich sociopaths who had no faith in humanity. I dont see how Gi Sung can gain anything from going back other than a 2nd season.I could praise the show for a while as the positives largely outweigh the negatives, i just thought i'd support the devil's advocate by asking questions that were being overlooked.8/10 Superb acting (the VIP's excluded), plot not as deep as you think."
987,Squid Game,"I wasn't experting a lot from this series, because movies/series that are this hyped are not usually the best. But this was great!! First of al the idea was awsome and the achting was exeptional, exept for the awful VIP's (but i loved the masks they where wearing) The set design is som of the best i have ever seen in any movie/series. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 9 is the ending. I won't go into it, but it is not at all what i was hoping for. I also love that Netflix is investing in foreign cinema, and the risk that they took was absolutely worth it!So i absolutely recomend this te everyone who can handle a little blood.PS: sorry for the bad english, I'm dutch so you know....."
988,Squid Game,"The games are somewhat interesting and the overall premise has some intrigue, but it lacks more than it gives. Poor acting, massive plot holes and a twist that's really average are ignored for mass carnage entertainment. I mean I get it - we all wanted to be entertained, even if it's poorly put together. The best kind of soup for the brain."
989,Squid Game,"Overrated show , I do not understand how people like it , I mean the idea is so cliché and the acting was one of the worst , Netflix tries its best to find a series to defeat HBO or ABC but they can not."
990,Squid Game,"I haven't read any reviews yet but I don't have to for this one. This was a little slow to pick up, cliché, predicable, has some spotty acting, and I didn't like the progression of the games or the last episode. Those are all my nitpicks and even with those, I still feel like I have to give this a ten.So, why the ten? This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments. I'll keep it short. If the trailer interested you, you probably won't be disappointed.""Everyone is equal here"" ""You think money can fix everything""?"
991,Squid Game,"Squid Game: it's everywhere. It is almost inescapable at this point. There are countless memes on social media and hilarious news articles. I was hesitant to check this out when people told me to watch it. Many times the most popular pieces of art pander to the lowest common denominator. And, to be honest, Squid Game does this frequently but it is a hell of a ride and there are thick layers of food for thought hidden underneath.This is by no means a perfect show or a masterpiece so let's begin by getting my complaints out of the way. Firstly, this show spells so much out for the audience to an insulting point but I understand why. Squid Game is a Netflix original and is by no means a foreign gem, such as the likes of Harikari or Departures. This was clearly written and directed in a way so that even the most simple minded audience can enjoy the story. Surprisingly, it's not that big of a deal. It works in a similar way to Disneyworld: there are the joyrides, concessions, and Mickey Mouse for the kiddies and while adults love that stuff too, they also have a bar for the adults.One example of the aforementioned pandering are the God awful flashbacks. When Gi-hun learns that his daughter is moving to the United States with her stepfather and mother, we are given a flashback to the dinner sequence where this fact was pretty obviously hinted at that happened only a few moments prior. I mean come on. How stupid do they think their audience is (a rhetorical question of course)? We also have the front man's reveal, which could have easily been left a mystery. I mean, I guessed that even before the cop found out his brother had been a contestant but I'm sure that Star Wars-Luke, I am your father-reveal worked for the general audience. But let's not lie to ourselves, that was hilariously corny. I laughed my ass of during that scene.Which leads to my second complaint: the predictability but, again, it doesn't detract much from the plot. Aside from the reveal that the old man was the master at the end, most of the M. Night Shyamalan ""twists"" can be seen coming a mile away.With that said, there's really not a lot to complain about here. Squid Game is addicting. I watched the show by myself in two sittings (it would have been one if I did not have to wake up early to register my car) and then I watched a good chunk of the show again with my mom, and I already want to watch the show again. Why? Two reasons: It is addictingly thrilling and there are actually some well hidden hints and Easter eggs scattered throughout.So while it does pander, it left me with a lot to think about. The games as a whole are somewhat of a representation of capitalism, which is not some pretentious high school theory, the director has said the show represents the class inequality in Korea. Think about it, here we have 455 disenfranchised individuals who are willing to risk their lives and kill others for money, many without a second thought. They even offer the players the chance to leave if the majority vote in favor of such a decision. This is a genius mechanism that I will get back to in a second. So the players are caged animals here. Behind the scenes, we have psychopathic aristocrats laughing there ass off and placing bets. Don't you think some rich asshole funded this movie? The premise of this movie is not that different from life in these so called ""democratic"" nations. We slave away at jobs that pay next to nothing and if at any moment we, let's say, need a surgery, we will be in debt for a good portion of the rest of our lives. We are basically the contestants in this show and the higher ups at the corporations we work at are the VIPS.This brings me back to the voting system. The players cannot stop playing the game but they can leave if the majority vote in favor of quitting. We can't stop working or we will become homeless and die. But we can vote to tax the rich or increase the minimum wage, yet most of us are so enslaved to capitalism that we would write that off as communism because we aspire to become the next Elon Musk (think about how many college aged white dudes love Elon Musk. They worship a man who has enough to feed his entire country).Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. I got political. It's a touchy subject but it's true and Squid Game is unafraid to speak out on it in a pretty haunting way.Anyway, I don't really need to recommend this show to anyone. You're most likely going to get sick of hearing about it and watch it like I did. Many of the obvious aspects of the show have already been talked about so I wanted to take a few moments to discuss some things the average viewer probably did not consider. It's obviously a great show and you will probably see it."
992,Squid Game,I started watching this show with some doubts. But after just 30 minutes I was invested in the storyline and could not stop watching. I could certainly it's the best show I have watched in a while. Great original storyline and talented actors!
993,Squid Game,"Watch one Episode you have seen it all.This is nothing special, and so predictable, definitive a no brainer nothing more."
994,Squid Game,"I watched this show a few weeks ago, I was very skeptical and honestly was over everyone over hyping it lol like I did plan to watch it but like eventually I wasn't in a rush but once I did I was like I should have watched it sooner.First of all, I think the point of this show is to prove how greedy people have become. How they would rather see everyone die at the chance of only one person surviving with all that money. Though the chance of them ending with the money was very slim. They did a such a great job at showing the intensity, the suspense, the plot twists. I loved the plot twist of the old man being behind it of it all. It was unpredictable, a lot of shows now a days can be very predictable but this show was just so incredible. The actors did a such a great job at expressing what their characters were feeling. There was so much expression on their faces at every scene to the point where the audience could feel their pain. I have to admit it made me tear up. This show was very gory, but anyone could learn a lot from it psychologically. It was truly, a great refreshing idea. Unlike any other show I've seen, I cannot wait for season 4!"
995,Squid Game,"Acting is so bad almost hard to believe these are some actors.My elementary and middle school kids saying everyone in school talks about it, so is this for soon to be teenage audience? No too much violence yet American kids are watching it like mcdonal of tv shows."
996,Squid Game,"I had the privilige to watch this show before it blew up, so I didn't expect too much. Squid Game is suspenseful and comes with a great metaphore, but at the same time doesn't offer anything new, we have seen it all before and that with better acting, better twists and better writing, so I'm a bit surprised by the rating.At the end of the day it is enjoyable to watch, but do not expect this show to be anything more than a pastime, sorry to the fans."
997,Squid Game,"It is a show based on Human Psychology, Emotions, Greed, Love, Respect and so many other things combined together. A brilliant story and a Must Watch."
998,Squid Game,"Great show but....
start at 9 star but gradually ends with 2 star. With very lame ending. I am unimpressed with the message the creator intend to show.."
999,Squid Game,This wasn't something that I would have picked on my own but when my boyfriend suggested it became something that I had trouble waiting for him. Dubbing takes a little to get use to but definitely worth watching.
1000,Squid Game,"This show had a great story! I thought the game rooms were the best part and made show come alive. The only thing that was annoying was the voice/dubbed dialog. Also, really liked the characters. Season 2 should be more about the games cause main guy is definitely going back in."
1001,Squid Game,"4stars. Hardly!I had high expectations before watching Squid Games... but it let me down.I am a fan of foreign and independent productions, never had the chance to watch from South Korea though.It starts off pretty well, but fails to keep the flame up with each following episode...
No spoilers ahead!In my humble opinion, if I want to rate the series in different aspects it will be as follows - the points are over 10.1- Acting: mediocre - 2
2- Story line: too predictable and highly unnecessary scenes - 4
3- cinematography: nothing new - 3
4- Music : boring -2
5- Length: Horribly long and boring durations of episodes (my wife and I usually do not use our smart phones while we watch a series... unfortunately we were constantly checking our phones...) - 3
6- Concept: very nice and new but with bad execution - 5
7- Production: average - 5
8-Ending: it does not end... please roll the credits!!! But you still watch... hehe! - 2 (and the red hair was a total turn off)
9- message: at least horses don't violently die in betting games."
1002,Squid Game,"Compelling, iam have way thru didn't got boring once so far. Nice designs, graphics and characters. Worth the watch for sure."
1003,Squid Game,"Found it formulaic & predictable. Not sure why this is popular & apparently trending. I found it shallow & storylines full of holes. I liked the ""North Korean"" character Kang Sae; wish they had done more with her character. Jun ho was just a loser who drifted along & had zero redeeming qualities.My opinions."
1004,Squid Game,"It started out promising; I thought it would be a different touch to the topics that we have already seen in other movies: hunger games, the game, maze, the exam etc. But it never got to the point where all the violence makes sense. Characters do not make sense, scenario do not build up to something meaningful. All that mysterious show-business-kind-of costumes and staging lose their effect when the plot is unable to deliver a meaningful explanation. In each episode until the last scene, I expected a twist or some progress so that I could appreciate all the hype but nope. It did not happen. If the message was injustice and humans gotta make their way with it, that's been done countless times and sorry, this didn't sell it."
1005,Squid Game,"This show is absolutely terrible, and the acting is shockingly crap, it's like rewatching the old Monkey series.Pretty crap for this day and age.Crap characters and crap show."
1006,Squid Game,"But the main takeaway from this series is never trust an old man. Besides that, there are lot of bad human habits exposed of course, and also unexpected situations that made this a solid nine for me, some things could have been better (i.e. The main character old friend is way too sadistic in most of the cases) but is truly a footage of the human being in the world."
1007,Squid Game,I found the show hard to sit through. It was uncomfortable and brutal. Sometimes the show moved slowly. Overall there are many deep lessons and over arching themes about classism in the writing. The acting is phenomenal. I appreciate the philosophical aspects of the show. It is another level of sophistication compared to your typical American drama.
1008,Squid Game,"A deeply poignant show that superbly builds its critique of our current economic system and the despair and utter desperation that it drives people to, particularly in the second episode. The acting is powerful and the characters also possess strong identities so you quickly come to see them as people.Unfortunately, the show peaks in the sixth episode, which was phenomenal and some of the best television I have seen. From then on, however, the quality declines, important subplots are left with no resolution, and the ending was erratic and dissatisfying: for example, it does not touch on previous themes of democracy and equality in the process.It feels as though the original script was heavily edited so as to allow a second season, and therefore make more money. Ironic in a critique of capitalism, but there you are.Overall, still worth watching."
1009,Squid Game,It used to make me cringe. But I'm not gonna watch this in the original language. English is already my second language. Hating substitles was the reason i learnt English before school to begin with.
1010,Squid Game,An absolute gem from South Korea. Amazing show from the first ep. To the last one. A must see...
1011,Squid Game,"Once again another overrated Korean series.. It was ok to watch but never worth what it was hyped for , Like how Parasite was never an Oscar winning movie."
1012,Squid Game,I haven't enjoyed a first season like this since Westworld and can't recommend this enough. Was a little bit jarring at first but really merged a lot of genres that had never been done before and knocked it out of the ballpark. A+
1013,Squid Game,"I read a short story 'The Most Dangerous Game' in high school with basically the same plot, but not sci-fi with special effects. I found the Squid Game super boring and just about every plot point was predictable. I think the average Superman comic book has more interesting twists than this overblown, stretched out story. It was a disappointment since there are a lot of Asian movies and series that have really interesting stories with characters that are more complex than video game ones. But if you like video games, there's a good chance you will like this movie, except that you have no control over the story. Now, if the producers could get the audience involved in determining the fate of the games, that could be interesting. As it is, it's hardly worth spending time writing about it (unless you're getting paid) and I""m not."
1014,Squid Game,"Curiosity got the best of us and we decided to give it a try and see what the general craze is all about. Watched it to the end, at some point just to get it over with, although it's pretty predictable, most of the actors are talentless and some almost deplorable. Voice over in English kind of helped a little - I don't think we could have watched it in Korean. Those who read Richard Bachman's ""Running man"" (Stephen King's alias) may have recognized the general idea of a deadly game played by desperate paupers in a distopian society - so nothing new here, right? However, Bachman's characters are likable, relatable and dignified in spite of their humility. Squid game's characters are greedy, vicious, non relatable and it's really hard to make a connection with them or feel anything - viewer sees them just like the glass chess-like pieces in one of the last games. Being unable to identify the characters by name doesn't help either. I won't even get into details about the level of violence - gory and unnecessary. So, why the craze? Beats me."
1015,Squid Game,Very well made series. They have done an exceptional job here with Netflix money. Definitely recommend.
1016,Squid Game,Don't waste your time on this pathetic series. You would be better off watching paint dry. Again Netflix produces more garbage entertainment. Gratuitous violence. Stupid plot. Unbearable acting.
1017,Squid Game,"Execution 9/10Substance 5/10Also very, very boring more than half the time.Was forced to watch this because my wife wanted to watch it.Can honestly say I want my eight hours back.Skip."
1018,Squid Game,Lot of the things in the story line don't make sense and situations happen abruptly without any context. Characters behavior are not consistent. There are no cliffhanger movements. Simply overrated and lot of hype.
1019,Squid Game,"(Contains mild spoiler)
What an amazing show! Korean drama of this type is so different and well done. So unique in every element - the set, filmography, costumes, plot, acting, emotion - all was just to the point.Aesthetic in a creepy way, emotional (I got all teary on the Gganbu episode), it also had so many life lessons that touched on so many aspects of life. The players there got me thinking about the fine line between good and bad. Another thing is that in comparison to the other actors, VIPs seemed to be more relaxed and preposterous as I was expecting them to be scary and serious. But that's the charm, I guess no one will be expecting those VIPs to be some old bored rich bummers.Adults playing kids games with their life at stake. Despite all those horrors that were shown in this drama, the rewatch value is 10 on 10.1 star down cause it didn't answer all the questions and I hope there will be a second season that I'll be waiting for."
1020,Squid Game,"Squid Games realisesThat even closest ppl will ditch/kill , when they want to become billioner or go ahead from you in life/career .Billioner thinks common man are like horse to whom we can do gambling & make ""FUN"" by using them .Many ppl will do buttering/use you when they need something , but same ppl will throw you OUT they have same power in thier hands."
1021,Squid Game,"Super letdown after all the excitement in the first 7 episodes. The last 2 episodes are pretty boring, especially the ending which is just plain silly! Overall, still good and worth watching."
1022,Squid Game,"I watched the whole season and though it was mediocre, I know a lot of people like it but I felt like some of the chapters were shallow and pretty much as a hole thought it was boring( I mean there might be some bias as I seen movies and some shows that are very similar)"
1023,Squid Game,Story keeps you captivating. Its little predictable but its great watch.
1024,Squid Game,The English parts of this show are just horrible. The vip acting is horrible. This should would be better if the vips were voiced over with Korean. The Korean actors had a better understanding of how English sounds...
1025,Squid Game,"""Squid Game"" is certainly a metaphor of our time: in order to achieve financial independence people are ready to sell their soul to get it.The funny thing is that the winner is actually the only player who seems to have kept a system of human values. The meanness of each person looks concealed but as soon as the series picks up the pace it is irrefutably showed.The acting was authentic and believable but the so called plot twist could have hit harder."
1026,Squid Game,"Genuinely interesting all the way through, it plays out like a living anime. All the characters are super fun to watch and everything feels genuine. There will definitely be a few things you can call a mile away but a lot more you could never tell, no doubt best thing Netflix has put out in years!"
1027,Squid Game,"Dont get me wrong, it was a fun tv show to watch; i finished it in 2 days. The acting (particularly by Ju-Ryoung Kim and Lee Jung-jae) was very good. The actors who played the game participants did a very good job too. I really liked the cinematography; the way some scenes were shot really fascinated me (especially the bullet scene and the tug of war game)
However i don't think it was a good idea to add the VIP members to the script, we didnt really get a background other than that they were rich, sick people who were apperantly, fans of these kind of twisted, underground game shows. They really weren't needed and the idea is not all that original either.I heard from people that it was like nothing i've ever seen before, however i really didn't find the plot original. Movies like saw, battle royal ,the hunger games and many other movies had the exact same plot so this show is really not that unique.Even though i do think this was a well produced tv show with good acting and an incredible cinematography, i think it is very overrated."
1028,Squid Game,"I usually find korean series dull and low quality with usually bad plots and acting but squid game is amazing and it exceeded my expectation and it surprised me being better than most new 2020s shows. The plot, acting (specially the main character) and it's musics are really good and satisfying and now I feel empty after finishing it, can't wait for season 2. The VIPs were so weird by the way all other actors were pretty good."
1029,Squid Game,"I have watched far more superior series and movies than this one . I felt like I wasted Nine hours for just a little fun.I am not saying series totally bad or anything , just saying not deserve that much rating.Newbies may love this series but I watched a lots of series like this one.."
1030,Squid Game,"It is not a bad series, but the hype around them is a joke... Money Heist or Alice in Borderland a million times better.This is only exciting for those who haven't seen a single movie in the last 20 years.I give them 1 star to ballance the hype, but its actually a 6-7 star thing, but the hype is too big, so for the justice i must to give them 1 star."
1031,Squid Game,"Well it's no surprise to see that almost all cast did a great job with acting, and loved the scenario. I like the creative mind of Korean film industry. However some parts, especially those about games were so predictable so I found myself saying ""oh maaaan not again, that's so cliche!"" Still I liked that at the end it was the old man, who was behind all of this. Fair, unfair, betrayal, friendship, the limits of people... you can see all aspects of humankind when it's a matter of life and death. Brutal but very true. I'm happy he took the little kid and gave it to 218's mother, but why the hell you didn't get on the plane? Well I'd go for a different ending ofc but what they did was necessary for a second season right. Considering also screenplay, decor, costumes, music this series is 8 out of 10."
1032,Squid Game,"I really enjoyed the show as a whole, but it was so predictable that it became more and more annoying with every episode, 0 twists and suprises. I could tell how the ending is gonna look just after the first game. I Immediately knew that the old guy is involved and they didn't even try to hide it, same scenario about the leader of the game, i knew that they are related, about 5 seconds after the cop found the card in his room. But that really can be just me, so my ranking is not affected by that. Acting is on a pretty decent level, except the VIP-s , these guys were really bad, it felt like they got netflix employees to do the scenes because there was a shortage of english-speaking people to do it. Overall the show was really fun and entertaining. One of the best shows that netflix came out with lately."
1033,Squid Game,"I think this is the best show ever made, if you are in confusion between stranger things and squid game, believe me squid game is best, my favourite series."
1034,Squid Game,"I think I haven't seen a more creative kdrama than squid game. And you can really see the hardwork and dedication the director has put into this great work of art.The characters, their motivations,cinematography, acting ,everything is top notch. Only complaint I would have would obiviously be VIPs but nonetheless best drama from korea till now."
1035,Squid Game,I loved everything about this show .. one of my best .. but the v.i.p acted so bad and made me out of the mood ..
1036,Squid Game,First episode was good second episode I played games on my phone while I watched. Will not watch again.
1037,Squid Game,The show in itself is unique it's like a Last man standing type of game but in a korean way the worst thing about the show was the weird panther VIP hated him.
1038,Squid Game,"Although this serie is definitely not perfect I loved it! Interesting concept and loved the games. I would have rated this higher based on my favorite scenes: the first 3 games and the main characters were perfect! But some parts ruined a higher score: The VIPS were terrible, the story of the police officer did not add that much and I did not like the glass game. But overall: go watch this."
1039,Squid Game,"Exciting, sensational, top series !!! More than expected. Amazingly thoughtful and inspired. All recommendations for fans of this genre!!It is watched in breath and each episode ends in anticipation of the next one being released immediately."
1040,Squid Game,Muat watch this series this is a gem well written and such a smooth script no boring scenes.
1041,Squid Game,"This is possibly one of the best things i've watched ina while, the only flaw about this show is that the VIP'S acting is actual VTT or at least it feels like it. It's not even acting it's just reading words, their acting is so un believably bad. Every other single aspect of this show is perfect."
1042,Squid Game,This show came out of nowhere. With it´s death game premise I was hooked. I liked that the main charakter wasn´t imidetly likeable so we can follow his growth as a person over the show. With some fun twists in the games and between the show never feelt stale.
1043,Squid Game,"Watched the first episode and its just horrifying. Granted I didn't think i was going to like it because I have a weak stomach for callous killing for the sake of killing, but i figured since it is so popular, there was going to be more to it and perhaps a way of turning such a bleak scenerio into something exciting.It does not do that. It is just plain awful. The fact that so many people could enjoy watching such hideous and senseless violence makes me think the world really is a bad a place."
1044,Squid Game,"I found this show to be very entertaining. It was fun, the suspense was terrific, and rather then cliffhangers after an episode, they had the, throughout the episode. A solid watch imo. Many little things were also no predictable which was good. One thing I knew was the ending. I wouldn't had known if it wasn't for ep 7 when the host said they couldn't host. If you focus on a small detail you'd know too I think. Overall very good showing."
1045,Squid Game,Love this show. I've watched the series twice now but keep getting distracted by the officer's battery life on his phone. He was taking pictures and videos and making notes the whole time he was there and never ran out of battery...lol.
1046,Squid Game,"Although squid game is the most popular series of the moment, there are many who hate it for this reason, since 3 seconds do not pass and you find something of it, be it a spolier or tik tok, but that does not prevent the series from being a green light, which experiences everything it has to do to make an excellent series, and it was achieved."
1047,Squid Game,"First episode was great, then the story fell into emotional moments cliché, come on, at least not in second episode. What's going on? But gladly, the episode 3 was back to good, however my excitement didn't last. Since round 5 the game started to be boring, in fact the 4th game was already not so good, but round 5 was a new low, it is an unsuccessful copy from Kaji, the Japanese manga, and 16 players for 18 choices can be a dead end for the game, so they drag out a former glass worker to help them to finish the game, and at that point I found the show is overrated. And I was right, the final game is nothing but a boring friend-kill-each-other. After victory they made most of final episode to justify the season 2 and why protagonist want to join new game. OK, I got it, Netflix, season 2 is on the way.Btw, I realized 001 was too smart to be a loser at 4th round, just don't know he was the holder all the time. So, it isn't a big WTF moment to me."
1048,Squid Game,"Did it entertain me? Yes. Was it new and exciting? Most definitely.Yeah, the VIP's were bad actors and so what. It doesn't matter it's still realllyyy good series."
1049,Squid Game,"Idea of the movie was ok, my problem is that the acting is so bad (like amateur level) that i could not get behind any of protagonists. If the serie would have ended after the first episode i could not care less. I'm not gonna watch any continuation of this series in the future."
1050,Squid Game,"You will live through this....you will feel the emotions and misery of the people.It's dark, shocking and yet gripping. Tru binge material for a weekend."
1051,Squid Game,Another game style type of movie from Korea.Great acting. Storyline good.The only reason I give it a 9 is because of it gets too many 10s one crazy rich guy out there might find it inspirational to start this type of game in real life.
1052,Squid Game,"The show made me cringe on so many levels and so many times. I feel like I've seen that show many times already and the characters as well as the actors behind we're subpar, typical and very predictive.Doing a show around this kind of concept where humans are subjected to man-made situations of violence and survival, similar to hunger games, is attractive to viewers, for some reason, and it was to be expected that there'd be weird explanations on why this kind of situation even takes place. So for this part I don't blame them.What disappointed me was the VERY poor characters, their development and interactions between them. Some characters, like the bully who led it's mean boys clan, or the girl who didn't name or child and ended up with the bully, only to get ditched by him, wow that was bad acting.I know people will still be entertained by it, I just wish they'd put some more giving this kind of show more personality than the stereotypical good guy, bad guy, etc."
1053,Squid Game,"As per my title this isn't a very original idea. It's been done time and time again: Highlander (1986), Battle Royale (2000), The Hunger Games (2012), Animal World (2018) etc. The only difference is the venue/place where they are held and the winnings at the end.I tried to watch this when it first appeared on Netflix, but after 3 episodes it still hadn't impressed me, and was quickly forgotten when I found something better to binge watch. After seeing all the hype about it I decided to give it another go, perhaps I should have given it 4 episodes? Nope it still didn't impress.I have to question the '111 million fans' claim by Netflix. I'm more inclined to believe it is 111 million 'Viewings' that include the multiple viewings by single individuals or their group friends at home or around at their friends houses when their parents are away. Viewings do not correspond to fans.The acting is your usual frenetic Korean overacting, overdone facial expressions combined with family honour/disappointment.The main characters, although given back stories, aren't what you would consider likeable so you don't really invest too much empathy into who will or won't survive, bearing in mind that 'There can be only one' (to quote Highlander) winner at the end of the game.My only real interest was in working out who was behind the whole setup of 'Squid Game' and who the 'Frontman' was. The clues are there and it didn't take me too long to have a (correct) working theory.I suppose if you are looking for some 'bloody' entertainment, that you can disengage your brain to watch, then this will meet your needs.I gave it a generous 6 stars as while it isn't as good as it is hyped to be it certainly isn't as bad as some of Netflix's underwhelming prior offerings."
1054,Squid Game,"Stephen King would find this familiar...his story The Long Walk was published in 1979 when he wrote as Richard Bachman, about an annual walk for boys from Florida to New York(if I remember correctly) with a large monetary prize for the winner. Those who could not walk at the required pace...were shot.I like this show so far. I'm on episode 4. It is pretty well made and makes me want to watch the next ""chapter"" Could it be better? Yes, but the story is good and it's alright the way it is."
1055,Squid Game,Must watch web series. Another entertaining non-English series enjoyed all through the episodes.
1056,Squid Game,This series is just great as it is. It teaches a lot about people and makes us wonder what would we do? Nothing could make me cry since Titanic until now. The scene when Ali dies is the saddest of all.
1057,Squid Game,Damn what I just watched. And.episode 6 just squeezed all the tears out from me.
1058,Squid Game,"Unlike in Kaiji, games here aren't about skill and insight but dumb luck and brute violence. The main character obviously doesn't use the latter, but has plenty of the former. The rule to be able to abolish games already made this a stinker, but about the middle of the season, the show died when killing fellow contestants outside of games became a thing, rendering the entire point of playing games utterly moot (why not have a giant 500 man battle royale in the first place... definitely a lot more fun to watch). However, in the last 2 episodes (and especially in the last one), Squid Game turned from mediocre to insultingly bad, and then to loathsomely bad. The main character is about the biggest f v cking idiot one can imagine, and he wins the game, turning this into a total fairytale of epically sucking proportions. I can only imagine Netflucks involved with this infected the Korean writer with the American loser gene (for an example, consider the ending of popular CGI animated movie Cars (2006), which features the exact same ending where losing out of one's own volition is glorified. Truly loathsome, and I could barely make it through said last episode. Needless to say, I won't watch season 2, or anything by that writer/director again, and additionally no other Netflucks show ever in my life (this was the first and last one).PS: Idiot main character guy (Korean names are the worst in the entire world, impossible to memorise) had the chance to save the freezing bum himself the entire time - there was no rule against it."
1059,Squid Game,"This show is amazing, episode six was so great. Probably one of the best tv show episodes I have ever seen. But I kind of did not love the end of the show. It was kind of odd and not meaningful. The VIPs were not as annoying as people make them sound! They're a nuisance but it's tolerable."
1060,Squid Game,Korean Actors are great. Every character played their role in excellence. Till episode 6 it's great. Later it's foolish.. showing capitalists people in stupid roles later on.. the Makers have some agenda in their mind.. Another Classic Series.. Ruined in later half..
1061,Squid Game,"This is just Salo of 2021, this isnt first time we see sickness like this. Vips are fascists. Over all this is show about sad people and it really make u think!"
1062,Squid Game,"What a great show. Pure escapism. Time really flew when I watched an episode.Of course there were some flaws, both plot holes and character inconsistencies but some of the scenes were right up there with some of the best strorytelling and script writing seen in recent years.The merchandise buying generated by this show will be crazy - already bought my 456 tracksuit for 5 a side football.Season 2 is a certainty and already it can't come quick enough."
1063,Squid Game,..... The heck.... Did I just watch?Very interesting show. Extremely violent so if you're not into that type of thing I would not recommend!
1064,Squid Game,"They start stern about violence between each other, then that doesn't matter after the first couple episodes. It's a good show, but contradicting itself drops my rating."
1065,Squid Game,Devastatingly perfect. This level of gorgeousness should not be possible. Shakespearean in stature. Prepare all your human emotions for a descent into the core of the human condition.
1066,Squid Game,Sometimes the story got a bit slow but you must keep watching! It is worth it.
1067,Squid Game,"I use to binge watch shows a lot. Then I kind of went through a slump. This show reminds me what a good show is about. The main cast were generally very good at making me sympathize. I think I recognize the stormshadow actor from GI Joe. The rich elite VIP actors (as other have mentioned) I swear were told to be hammy. Thankfully their scene presence is short. Make no mistake, this show is somber, melancholic and not a rainbow /sunshine kind of show.Some questions about this world is revealed and so It sounds like there could be a season 2 but I really kind of wish they don't focus on the games again."
1068,Squid Game,"Korean tv NEVER disappoints, this show was utterly creative, idea , execution , acting , and whole lotta thrill, it kept me wanting for more, GREAT job!"
1069,Squid Game,"Best Series I have Ever watched my whole life. I DONT think that I will ever watch a series so bingeworthy , so fun , so exciting ...
Just Amazing."
1070,Squid Game,"Very compelling opening episodes, but when the actual plot unravels it makes you go, ""Oh, that's just it? That's kinda lame"". Great acting still, amazing sets, overrides the glaring flaws of the series, an enjoyable watch overall. 7/10."
1071,Squid Game,"I saw this while scrolling on Netflix and noticed it was trending on Twitter & such so I checked it out not fully knowing what to expect. This show is crazy....in a good way! Although some of the concepts and choices here have somewhat been done before it doesn't matter because I've never had an experience before, like I did with this show. Anytime a show/ movie can offer that experience it deserves recognition. Still not sure how to feel about the ending but this is definitely an awesome series. Also I would recommend watching this with the Korean dialogue and English subtitles, it feels more natural and you can hear the real actors performance this way."
1072,Squid Game,This series has many hidden clues. Korean series and movies never disappointed me they are full of humours and fats ONE SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THIS.🤐
1073,Squid Game,"The only reason i clicked on the recommend for you was because I'd heard about Netflix being sued.This is a pure hype, social manipulation play."
1074,Squid Game,"I really loved the show, it was absolutely nerve wrecking and kept me at the edge of my seat most of the time. Plot wise and cast wise its all good. I didn't really like the ending, i felt it was rushed a bit. As for the VIPs i really hated how they were portrayed. They're supposed to be the main reason for running the game but they're a bunch of old ridiculous perverts. This really annoyed me. Apart from this, i enjoyed it alot, waiting for season 2."
1075,Squid Game,I really enjoyed this tv show. It was a little slow sometimes but it was still good. I really hope for a season 2.
1076,Squid Game,"Not often do I watch foreign films but sometimes there is a jem. This is one for sure. .Do yourself a favor dont dub it in with your language, hear and feel the real actor, his or her voice and emotions. The subtitles will come easily after the first 15 mins.. . I found the acting great..just ignore the VIPS part lol..that passes fairly quickly anyway..otherwise some you may become fond of, it causes emotions to rise and fall, there is mystery, suspense, some comedy, but mostly it holds you on the edge to what will be next. Who is who..and so forth. I enjoyed so much I went on the hunt for another Korean show..im now enjoying (not as good as Squid in my eyes)Sweet Home. Highly recommend Squid."
1077,Squid Game,"It was top notch for me till the VIPs came !!! I would rate it 9.0 even more !!!But from when the vips came ,the story didnt feel the same !!!Set design is awesome and also acting is superb !! I will remember for a long time ,the depressed eyes of Jung hoyeon !"
1078,Squid Game,"This would get an 11 if I had that option. Just when you think there is little inventory on new concepts, this series pops up and is beyond unique and thought provoking. I can't wait for the second season. An absolute masterpiece. The reviewers who think it's all about killing people miss the point entirely."
1079,Squid Game,I only started watching this show after hearing / reading how good it supposedly is and I made it to episode 4 and gave up. I really didn't enjoy this at all and found it silly and boring. I won't be watching any more of it.
1080,Squid Game,"Great show overall. But I have to say something about II-Nam. I feel like they ruined the character II-nam by making him the one behind the whole thing... It destroyed everything of a character arc with him. And because of this it also ruins everything between II-nam and Gi-Hun in episode 6. Why did they make us care for the old man like that, only to completely destroy it in the finale?! :("
1081,Squid Game,"A Korean series that shows a group of people who are put in a deadly game for money until one wins and manages to survive. We saw the story before but it has moments that are captivating, the message of social criticism is interesting. Obviously it's not perfect there are script conveniences, moments when the story is unnecessarily slowed down. It's worth it anyway."
1082,Squid Game,"It's an interesting concept for sure. But the scene where the VIPs arrived looking like they were ready to perform in The Masked Singer is just so dumb.Plus rows of identical cars boarding a ferry at night seems like the kind of thing that would get flagged as suspicious.And the cop not calling for backup? Running directly in the line of sight of the rear view mirror. A game that has been going on for years and yet no security at the gates. Choosing to go at it alone. Risking it all for his 1 kidney brother. That's just senseless.Evading the armed troops in a labyrinth littered with cameras is also senseless.I felt like the revelation of the anarchy rule in the dorms was a bit rushed. A small guy attacking a thug with a freaking face tattoo while he was with his group of thugs is something that I do not see happening. Then the small guy dying so quickly.Given that you can just kill each other in the dorm, Deok-su could have killed Mi-nyeo with his bare hands but he didn't.Back to the VIPs. They are my main gripe. The awful script. Goodness gracious. I had to pause every few lines because it was just abysmal.I thought the painted naked people were unnecessary.All that aside I did enjoy the show overall. The games were simple yet creative. And I always love a good tug of war.I thought they did good by restarting the contest with those who chose to come back eyes wide open. You feel less for them since they chose their own destiny.The story was also insightful. The portrayal of gambling addiction. Predatory lending in South Korea. The concept of throwing good money at bad and going for broke. Chasing the ever elusive dream of winning big money. I also liked how they covered the topic of religious hypocrisy.I loved the characters they created.Massive spoilers below.It was obvious who the stronger guy was. He is also exponentially smarter. Yet somehow at the end he was a flailing idiot who could not anticipate obvious moves from the offensive and instead just attacking widly. Makes no sense.It was a bit too obvious who the finalists would be.And it was a bit obvious that the old man was in on it when they did not show his death. Tried a bit too hard to be poetic at the end.But Gi-hun coming out looking like freaking Party Poison at the end was hilarious.The fact that he took the kid and just gave him to the old woman was such a typical useless dad thing to do.Leaving his mother without a caretaker, is a typical useless son thing to do. Always with the grand noble intentions. Far too little, far too late.Then turning his back on his daughter, is really typical also.If you are a bad son, and a bad father, all the money in the world cannot change that. Just because you are not evil does not mean that you are a good person."
1083,Squid Game,"I think emotions and struggle in this series connects every audience, best part is every contestant came in a hope of winning money but after a certain part of this series everybody realizes how much precious life is, this series entertains but at the end makes every audience think about importance of life, a master creativity."
1084,Squid Game,"But to tell you the truth, it is so so for me, no intrigue. I did not get the wow effect, no strong desire to watch it again. There is lots of violence and killing, and the methods of some of these murders are kinda brutal. The main purpose of this show what people would really do for money and to show how far people would go."
1085,Squid Game,"The show does not live up to the hype.It's ok, but not as spectacular as the hype would indicate. I preferred alice in borderland over squid games. Now they are pushing for season 2, and I am guarantee you, season 2 gonna fail - big time! Mark my words."
1086,Squid Game,The show is pretty decent upto prefinal episodes but messed up later. All that police guy investigation is just show that front man is his brother ? And main lead has most turboulous mind ever (eg: want to kill his friend in prefinal episode and want to save the same friend in final episode). I honestly think this show is overrated and it deserves 7/10.
1087,Squid Game,Good but not as much as people talk about it.Could be ended in lesser episodes.For me it's a overrated series. You won't miss a lot if you don't watch it.
1088,Squid Game,"This is by far the Worst TV Show in the History. Congratulations, Netflix should win a prize for the most boring and the most poorly written snooze fest of a ""show"". I've heard that Netflix was bad but I didn't knew it was This bad. Boring. Yep everyone was right when they said #CancelNetflix."
1089,Squid Game,That is having to really resist binge watching it.This has been the first Netflix show since the Sinner that has ticked that box for me.Super atmospheric and really dystopian. That music as the walk the Esher like corridors and stairsOnly thing I didn't like was some of its odd attempts at humour but this might be a Korean cultural thing.
1090,Squid Game,"As a massive fan of all Korean cinema and tv (that I can get my hands on) I was naturally excited.The entire failure for me, lies in being unable to find a single character I can relate to. My ambivalence about the antagonists deaths removed any suspense anx drama.Not as good as Kingdom, by a long 16th century mile."
1091,Squid Game,The way the last episode did is similar to Game of Thrones' last few seasons. It was just a dumb ending. He could have boarded the plane and it would have ended right then there. And the hair colour..just wtf.
1092,Squid Game,"I came in with big expectations...and, yup it was worth the hype.. First half was amazing...the build-up was great.. It was an intense, emotional, heartbreaking ride.. I cried which is usually hard for me to do especially over a movie / series.... Everything was great until they reached their limit of creativity and trying...long story short... everything stopped being serious and authentic like before and from now on it was a drag until the end... Second half was so mediocre and underwhelming and sadly even poorly executed.. Didn't even have a realistic feel to it like the beginnings...I'm impressed and disappointed at the same time..."
1093,Squid Game,"First of all loved the acting of everyone..Show is full of suspense,action,Thrill..They could have made it more awesome but I'm not gonna complain like others cz it's awesome..Really loved it And enjoyed it..Want more season of squid game."
1094,Squid Game,"Squid Game is great show and worth the hype it gained on social media. The ending, however, was a bit of a let down and also confusing. It's very gory, and violently gruesome, so not suitable for sensitive viewers."
1095,Squid Game,"I appreciated the effort put into this programme, the meaning of money, human relationships, good or bad. The options we used were overdubs in English, there are plenty of them and subtitles if you prefer. The acting even with overdubs is superb, all emotions are conveyed perfectly, be warned although the games are childlike they present severe consequences if you lose. Definitely a binge watch, you'll be wanting more and be prepared for those heartfelt moments,there are quite a few. It's the best programme I've watched for awhile I had no hesitation in give this Netflix series full marks."
1096,Squid Game,After long i get master piece from korean web series bt only disspointment is vip s role.
1097,Squid Game,"The synopsis by itself was a big turn-off for me. Moneyed people coming up with games for their amusement where poor people's lives are at stack and only one out of all players come out as winner /still-not-dead.Its happening all around the world, in wars, in other crisis situations. We get it. But in real life, super-rich are very, very smart and never mention such 'games' even indirectly. They only mention charities their wives work for.Lack of likeable characters was uninteresting. I know the trend is to show real, humane characters. But really, no likeable character at all? That's not believable either."
1098,Squid Game,Super good cant believe this was based on a true story. We have to stop them.
1099,Squid Game,"A movie with many themes, greed, poverty, the exploitation of human frailty and more. Fantastic acting by numerous South Korean stars. Loosely based on the horrors of the Holocaust."
1100,Squid Game,"Forget about people complaining about the acting of the VIP characters, the acting overall was bad. It was distracting, took you out of the scene and was unintentionally humorous.I didn't care much for the characters. I wasn't interest in them. They obviously wanted you to care about the old man but frankly I found him annoying and was hoping he would die and get off the screen ASAP.One of the big ""reveals"" you can see coming a mile away. The other, you likely won't see coming but I didn't care much when it happened.I wouldn't have made it through the series if I didn't fast forward and skip boring parts... and there were quite a few."
1101,Squid Game,"The first four episodes are amazing, real character development and you feel as though you are getting to know and care for these players. I found myself desperate to know what was going on, who was behind these games, and why did they set it up.The next two episodes are OK although I did find myself getting a little bit bored in places.The last three episodes are not good. In fact they are bad. The terrible acting of the Americans has been mentioned in many reviews so doesnt need me to go back over it, but the twists were awful. More than once I found myself thinking ""oh for god sake"" at these reveals.The reveal of who the front man was signposted so clearly that I was disappointed that it was him, and the fact that there was no back story to explain how he came to be the front man was an obvious omission from the show so that they have a plotline for series 2.The storyline with the policeman goes absolutely nowhere - he gathers information, escapes the bad guys so many times with the help of plot armour and gets a recorded confession from an organiser of the games, and then is killed before he can do anything with it. Either that was a complete waste of storyline or he's not dead and again the whole thing was a set up for a season 2 plot.Final plot twist - the person who originally came up with the idea. It was obvious from the episode with the marbles who this was, but it would still have been good to have an answer to the question why did they set these games up? The answer we got of I was rich and bored was very unsatisfactory and to me completely ruined everything I had watched for 9 episodes. I WAS BORED. What sort of a reason is that??The only good thing about the final episode is seeing the survivors guilt of Gi-Hun, watching him struggle to live and not spending any of the prize money was really moving and when he asked the bank manager for a loan of 10,000 it did bring a lump to my throat. I thought that whole part was acted beautifully and portrayed stunningly. His transformation at the end looked right too.Everything of the last three episodes is written to set up the next series, not give any satisfactory conclusion to the story and this left me feeling cheated.Overall the series has been totally overhyped. So many times this happens with Netflix shows. I think in this case people were so blown away by the first few episodes they forgave the terrible writing, poor acting and obvious plot twists and unsatisfactory conclusions of character arcs later in the story."
1102,Squid Game,Entertaining as K-dramas can be with clever plot twists and watchable characters. But really far fetched.
1103,Squid Game,"Squid Game ranges from a sub-par beginning to a conceptually watertight closer: regardless of what you say, an aimlessly dramatic finish would be in key with the rest of the show, but my god was the ending one hell of a twist.Squid Game instead morphs into one hell of an artistic statement, going from comical proportions to a satire show on human nature and capitalism. Even the criticisms against the casting of the ""VIPs"" makes no sense: it is a caricature of a lot of white men in power, I'm talking about the Harvey Weinstein's of this world.So at the end of the day, Squid Game starts off as something that seems unreal, but it ends surprisingly human. There's nothing quite like it."
1104,Squid Game,"An absolutely joy to watch, even with the dark themes.Is it perfect? No, it is not. There are certainly things in it that annoyed me (the police officer subplot)
But over all I still absolutely loved the story.I wasn't keen on the ending though. This would've been perfect as a once off story with the MC defeated and alone, skimping money off bank managers. But that's my personal opinion."
1105,Squid Game,"But I loved every second of it! Must watch, and use the subtitles not the audio dubbing if you need English. You will forget you are reading subtitles after 5 minutes and get a more accurate translation."
1106,Squid Game,"Overall, it wasn't a bad show! It definitely has an interesting twist to classic children games from Korea. It also has many talented actors and actresses! Definitely worth the watch."
1107,Squid Game,I never seen a movie in this language and I had no problem with having to read it. I watched it twice. I had no problem having to read this movie. So good. Reminded me of the Hunger Games. I think this kind of thing is going to happen in the future. I liked the old man the best.
1108,Squid Game,"This tv show is the most watched tv show on Netflix. Personally, what I don't like about it is that it was way to popular. In one scene, there is far to much inappropriateness.When I watched this, I was obsessed with it but now, I think it is okay. A few bloody scenes but I'm sure a responsible human being can handle it. I recommend for 18."
1109,Squid Game,So overrated.Watched in fast forward since it's full of soup for the soul long scenes.Seen much better ones with similar theme..
1110,Squid Game,"Morbidly enough I'm a fan of Battle Royal or for more classic literature Till there was None (10 Little insert name of whatever variation you prefer) So I had to check this one out. This one went the safe route and kept with only a few characters and followed them through out. Stephen King's The Long Walk followed the same plan. This allowed me to connect with the characters easier. This show is heavy on emotional manipulation but I was ok with that. I felt what they wanted me to feel and when. For this I believe they did an excellent job. The set design and music led to the uneasy feeling that helps you feel the stress of the characters. The show is gruesome in parts, so that's your warning if your squeamish. I was a little put off by the lead character during the 1st episode and in the final scene. That is probably the biggest reason I can't rank this higher. Overall though I really enjoyed this show."
1111,Squid Game,Better than expected. Dont wach the dubs. Original is way better. Sorry about the VIPs they are terrible. Other than that. Amazing until the last second.....
1112,Squid Game,"All the dubbed English voice overs sound like they're doing voices for a Disney movie...badly. For people here who say it doesn't ruin it for them, I don't see how that's even possible. It's so comical it takes you out of the story completely."
1113,Squid Game,The scene in the 3rd episode where the woman is screaming that she has to pee? I can't remember the last time I've seen acting so awful. Both the actress and the voice-over actor couldn't be more over-the-top. Almost gave up the whole thing right then.
1114,Squid Game,Ok. Just watched ep 6 and I take back my 2 stars. Still only gave it 7 bc the voice overs still aren't good but you can see in their faces how wonderful the actual actors are in this.
1115,Squid Game,"If you have read The running man by Stephen King you know why is it my standard. And that is a masterpiece. This could be, but because of some little things it failed. To be honest, this is an outstanding show, and I love South-Korean cinematography, but with some little changes this could be a masterpiece of all time. Just think about Parasite..."
1116,Squid Game,"I have mixed feelings about it. It was good but at the same time it was just OK. But, I did have a hard time stopping myself from watching just one more episode all the way to the last one. Will be interesting to see where it picks up where it left off. If it does, that is."
1117,Squid Game,Im still thinking about it. Its freaking genius!!!
1118,Squid Game,"This whole thing worked very well for me. With the exception maybe for the VIP scenes (how were they so bad?). Otherwise I loved all the character growth/progression or degression in some aspects. And I was very entertained the whole 9 episodes, which I watched over 2 days!"
1119,Squid Game,"I really enjoyed the serie overall,
However the last episode was very very disappointing, The main character has done the opposite of anyone else would've done."
1120,Squid Game,"One of the best K Netflix series I've seen in recent years. The plot, cinematography, and acting (with the exception of some masked caucasians in the end) was superb. Several A-list actors were in this show and the cameos by them were very well woven into the story. Looking forward to a season 2."
1121,Squid Game,"I think it deserves my rating of 8/10. I think the main reason that I liked it was it made me care about the characters and what happens to them.Some things made no sense though. For example, why would 456 (and others) keep assuming that it's possible to win the game together with someone else? Everytime he was like ""we're gonna get out together"" I got confused as to why he thought more than 1 would survive.Another thing that I thought was stupid was at the end of the glass game, the girl (one of the last three) was injured by the glass shard. It just made no sense to me to do the exploding thing and potentially ruin the last game. But I guess they had to figure out a way to get rid of her so that the 2 men can have a 1 on 1.There's more weird things like that but I guess it doesn't make a huge difference to most people.Definitely worth a watch though."
1122,Squid Game,"Every little while a massive hit pops out out of nowhere on Netflix. Black mirror, Stranger things, etc. Squid Game is the new addition of those timeless masterpieces."
1123,Squid Game,"Although this web series is indeed Superb i liked it very much but, I didn't like the ending part.But viewers should watch this adventure web series you will enjoy it too
I like all the characters especially the old Man he was very calm n emotional....Must watch ppl."
1124,Squid Game,"This is a horrible show. The idea could have merit but the extremes on everything from the over acting, language, bad translation, script, over the top on blood and gore made trying to watch painful. I have also heard a lot of kids are watching this - it is definitely not a family friendly show."
1125,Squid Game,"First and foremost, a big round of applause for the director 👏👏👏 This is by far the darkest and most 'un-korean', edgiest Korean TV series I've watched to date.There isn't the typical sponsored usage of Samsungs, Mercedes, Subway, McDonald's or any of the big names that one would catch in a typical Korean TV series.It's grippingly leaves you at the edge of your seat craving for the next episode and the next.A must watch and absolutely loved the idea of the series."
1126,Squid Game,"This is the first Korean Series I have ever watched and I am glad I gave it ago.Lee Jung-jae (Seong Gi-hun #456) made this show for me. Given the fact he is the main character given the responsibility of capturing the audience during the initial introduction, he gave an amazing performance throughout the series.The show itself is a nice mix a gripponh dramatic thriller but with a slightly comedic element that wasn't forced. I liked the way you got a sense of background for each of the main characters. No doubt the costumes and symbolism is going to be iconic. So credit to Hwang Dong-hyuk for coming up with this concept.I think the performance of Anupam Tripathi (Abdul Ali #199) should also be commended. For a Korean Series to achieve such diversity in a show was great and he played his role to a tee.So all in all well played Korea and your spot at the top of many charts is quite an achievement. I gave it an IMDb 9, however really its a 10/10 from me."
1127,Squid Game,Two points deducted for Ali and Sae Byeok. They deserved better. That's all.
1128,Squid Game,"Just amazing, Korea movies has a kind of emotion express very strong of characters, not like US movies, usually less talking and less face's emotional, just like Parasite movie, also a good Korea movie, I really hope Korean can make more movies like this, very intense, drama and twist, which everybody loves it."
1129,Squid Game,That one episode got me hooked in particular. I rarely binge watch the whole show but I did for this show. There is a reason it is such a mega hit worldwide.
1130,Squid Game,"Cannot understand the hype.Slow, unoriginal, with obvious ""plot twists"" and barely a story or a character worth to be remembered.Around 9 hours of nothingness.Do yourself a favor and spend your time on something else, a lot of people have already wasted their own so you don't have to."
1131,Squid Game,"Low effort program basically designed to entertain simple people who like to watch people die. Not even remotely good, the bar continues to sink."
1132,Squid Game,"Its good thriller scenes , make viewers want to what happened next . Action & acting are good. There is Hunger games or Death race vibes ,But however i feel its way more predictable. For a TV series fan i think it obvious that from the first scenes where the games introduced can predict its a death game or like when meeting Number 01 player it gets the vibe that he is involved.When they first leave the games that they obviously come back.Only scene that i didn't get a vibe before was last scene that he kill himself.Nevertheless good thriller considering its Korean."
1133,Squid Game,"First of all, that was one of the best designs I have ever seen in my life! The idea is great but there were many flaws, like the overdramatizing, overeating some characters are just don't know how to act! The VIP actors were terrible. You get bored in the middle episodes I don't understand the hype about this show."
1134,Squid Game,"The acting is over the top bad, especially one of the women is terrible, I fast forward whenever she has any lines, the plot is drawn out, I got bored after 3 episodes, I didn't cared for any of the characters or what happened to them, and why couldn't the guards see the cheaters in the honeycomb game? Maybe to push the plot forward? In conclusion nice ideas but bad execution."
1135,Squid Game,"So hard to stop watching this crazy stupid show. Got to give it to the writers, it was so addictively captivating.Set design was so good you'll be seeing every halloween costume this year look the same.Episode 6 was by the far the peak of this series, an unbelievable conclusion to the previous 5 episodes. After that however, I can't say much... seemed to drift from the theme of fairness and equity among players which I really liked.Definitely recommend this series. Even though some of the mysteries that were trying to be sneaky were quite apparent early on, it didn't take away from the excitement and stakes of the game.(And something that I knew bothered many people was the atrocious acting by the American characters. Not sure if the problem was poor casting choices or some kind of language barrier, but damn, I can safely say for everyone- that part was hard to watch)"
1136,Squid Game,"So sad & boring. I didn't read a lot about it before watching - just listened to the hype. I'd rather do dishes, honestly. I expected more game & less emotion."
1137,Squid Game,"From some of the Manga Death games I've read Squid game is a decent port of the idea to the big screen done in this fashion. Sounds like its popular enough on Netflix that we will probably see copy cats soon (Maybe even a non-death version like Liars Game could be on the table now). As for the show itself I found it lacking in some parts, also didn't like most of the participants except the old man who was the standout. I found only about 2 of the games interesting."
1138,Squid Game,"This series is a good combination of Saw(1+2) + Hostel(1+2)
You should watch these movies to believe me that this is a great copy."
1139,Squid Game,"That's the best thing about streaming services. Without them we would never watch a series like that! This was my first Korean series I ever watched and I'm pretty sure it won't be the last. Keep them coming on netflix! We need more countries to get the opportunity to show they can provide us with something worth watching! The show was great, the acting was amazing and unlike most battle royale types of shows i've seen, i actually cared for many characters! I loved it, i enjoyed every minute of it and i'm surely coming back at a possible second season."
1140,Squid Game,"It's really an awesome show, episodes are 1 hour or more long however you won't feel that time coz series never gets bore or slow, once you will start it you will finish it in one go. Watch it, it's really worth of your time."
1141,Squid Game,"Great series, but I agree with most other reviews. The VIPS were ridiculous."
1142,Squid Game,"For me the dubbing was a distraction, some of the voiceovers were awful.Certainly one of the most hyped shows of the year but despite a few exciting parts it was on the whole flat and lacking."
1143,Squid Game,Very unique storyline that entertain you each of episode and very much engaging. Each game that are featured is simple yet thrilling. You don't want to miss this one.
1144,Squid Game,"Korean content always blow my mind. It is totally different than what I have seen yet. Different story. Few episodes are little slow on story side, but will be satisfied after watching this series."
1145,Squid Game,"One of the absolute best shows I've seen, possibly ever!I dont understand comments about the acting, the acting is great, except VIPs
Totally deserves all the hype!"
1146,Squid Game,"I've seen my fair share of survival genre shows and games, so I wasn't overly interested in watching this series, but since so many of my friends had seen it, I figured I'd give it a try. To my surprise, the first few episodes were quite compelling and the characters felt more 'human' and less two-dimensional than many other shows/movies/games I've seen in this genre.I think I was thoroughly enjoying this series up until I finished episode 6. Ep 6 was great, and emotional, but episode 7 onwards were just awful for me. Episode 7 in particular might've been the worst one. The challenge could hardly be called a 'game', and the VIP characters were unbelievably painful. I couldn't understand how the dialogue was so bad. The cuts to them and their cliche (and repetitive) dialogue made me lose that feeling of immersion I had with the other episodes. Episode 8 didn't feel like it really achieved anything, and episode 9... well, the 'twist' was quite unsatisfying. It didn't feel very believable, and there wasn't any closure with regard to the policeman and what he had attempted to send to the police when he got to the beach in the previous episode. It really just felt like there were some weird loose ends.So, I would give this show even a generous 10 stars for the first 6 eps, but I really was so disappointed by the subsequent three that I can only give it 7 stars."
1147,Squid Game,Like the concept but the dubbing renders it ridiculous. Needs to be viewed in original language with subtitles. Otherwise it's just a joke. Shows how easy it is to please people nowadays if this is as popular as they say it is.
1148,Squid Game,Those soundtracks made even the most awful games seem glamorous. Congrats to sound production! I'd highly recommend this new series. It's nothing you have definitely never seen before!
1149,Squid Game,"People are overestimating this series in a way never seen before, it's just an average series,
basically this series takes several movies and series and mixes them all together, the only game that's really interesting to watch is the first one."
1150,Squid Game,"Pointless. All these people think they will be the last one? None of it makes any sense if you're looking for any rationale for rational for even the short scenes. No tension here. The characters are all so stupid, you actually like when they get shot. Complete stupidity."
1151,Squid Game,"I have never seen a ""last man standing gets the money"" movie/series that pulled me in as much as this did. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. (Not just because I had to read the subtitles) the raw emotion and human spirit that was shown throughout, and especially at the very end by the main character, was emotionally moving, to say the least. The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them. Would I be a part of Squid Game? Definitely not. I have too much to lose. Beautiful, yet sobering series."
1152,Squid Game,"Looking at name, I wasn't much into it. Trailer was also ok'ish. I just casualy played the first episode and then boom, was hooked. Binge watched later episodes.It has multiple 'oh fxxx' moments. Caste is nice and everybody has given their best in acting department. Cinematography is good too. Ending was unusual and came as a surprise, with a twist. Definitely going to watch season 2, whenever that comes out. I think Netflix will bring multiple seasons of this looking at response it is getting. This hatke drama was good for a change."
1153,Squid Game,"Netflix has given a solid blockbuster with this series. Starting from the concept upto the execution, everything is perfect and all actors performed brilliantly. A must watch."
1154,Squid Game,"""Squid Game,"" with its unusual title, is a well-produced, acted, high-end production value show.Most folks know it's about people who've lost their way financially and take a chance on playing children's games to win multi millions in Korean won.The participants find out their moneyball plays for keeps: When you lose, you lose PERMANENTLY.The show pulls out all the stops with costumes, a big cast of recognizable Korean actors, all of whom do fine jobs. You hang on to find out how far the puppetmaster will go in this life and death elimination match. All this is very good.Where ""Squid Game"" falls short is on character details. Not that there isn't enough: There's too MANY characters and too much detail. You hear their backstories from the start and you KNOW you'll hear how they've failed in a future episode.I found that I wasn't engaged with ALL the characters or their tales. Two or three, maybe four, were enough, but there's nearly 8 principals. The woman who's left her kid behind and sucks up to a gang leader; the gang leader, the feckless dad, the stockbroker, the dying man and their children, ex-wives, mothers.I think with Korean drama it might be the more the merrier. But after 5 episodes I was done with backstories and wanted to get on with it.I skipped to the final episode and the ending wasn't a surprize. Shades of Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" without the sex, and a mishmash of other sci-fi, and gory horror films and TV shows.It's a morality tale, for sure. You make your bed, you might be able to get out of it, but not without spilling buckets of blood. It's interesting, however, how the program seems to moralize that death is better than dishonor. Sort of hari kari. They are shamed by their participation, but if they don't win the game at hand, death solves their predicament, in a horrible way.Yet, the dead are COMPLETE losers. No prize money goes to their families. They're simply out of the game. Wow!Though we have a winner, the person isn't exactly happy. So money doesn't solve all your problems: another truism. Not bad, but not perfect. Worth a looksee. The ending leaves an opening for the game to continue, too, for those who love to watch."
1155,Squid Game,"This Korean show has great production value, a fun storyline, and some of the best AND worst acting possible. However thrilling its first half of the episodes may be, later on the show suffers from some bad pacing, acting and other irregularities. More importantly though, the show's big plot twist is already easily guessed after watching the first episode, which makes for an anticlimactic finale. Maybe a next season will tie up some of the many loose ends and will give some more depth to the otherwise rather shallow plot. All in all, it's a fun ride - however, not as good as the hype is letting you on!"
1156,Squid Game,"The idea starts quite well (even though it is nothing new) but it becomes predictable after the 2nd episode and it contradicts itself quite often even though the premises are simple.I was expecting a mind-blowing series but it did not reach my expectations. Quite disappointing even though the acting by the ""players"" is really good and some scenes are have a surprising sceneray with a carefully chosen color palette.On top of that the ending does not make any sense whatsoever."
1157,Squid Game,"Some sick mind created this..
Unnecessary brutal piece of sh.t."
1158,Squid Game,"If you are familiar wth 90s 20s movies, you probably watched not exactly but similar scripts in your life. But still it has nice twists. I have to underline the costume design especially masks. The masks were great but the Fromtman's mask is a-ma-zing! It looks neutral and wierd as emotionless mask of Joey Jordison if not better! Using gaming console button signs as ranking in whole script was also a nice touch.Finally i came here to mention the horrible acting of the VIPs and looks like I am not alone! If i was one of them I would ask my part to be removed after watching others in episode gganbu for example. Their acting is a documented proof that you cant hide bad acting behind a mask. If they didnt had a peak on their collegues performance during the shooting, they can watch Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven at least. It is a free lecture..."
1159,Squid Game,So many twists and turns this show keeps you guessing every episode! It's an amazing show all the way through. Definitely deserves it's spot amongst the Netflix top 10.
1160,Squid Game,"I would give the set design for this series a ""10."" The rest of the show is not very good.Too much of the ""plot"" is obvious. You know the antihero main character will be the one to survive from the very beginning. You know the old man is behind everything because he's an anomaly and, unlike everyone else, has no reason to be in the game. Also, he's number 001, a real giveaway. You know there's some sort of relationship between the ""head man"" and the cop. You know the last game will be the ""squid game."" There are also other obvious things that come out in the first two episodes.The first episode is overlong; there's way more than the needed exposition to set up the plot to move on. The second through seventh episodes are the best, but there aren't many real surprises aside from the excellent set designs. The last two episodes are truly awful and boring. When the indefatigable cop ""disappears"" into the sea, you know that there will be a second season. But the final ending where the main character turns back from boarding the plane is really embarrassing; he might as well have held up a sign saying ""Be sure to watch Season 2.""All of the characters have the depth of comic book personae, especially the ""evil"" ones. The fact that none of them are believable characters wouldn't be a problem if the writers didn't try to create melodramatic moments when we're supposed to actually care about them and believe in their plights. No one in their right mind would leave hell and then let circumstances change their mind and therefore decide to re-enter a situation that leads to certain death.""Squid Game"" reveals many of the problems that plague most of Netflix's movies and series: They are bloated, overlong, and stretched-out in order to fill up a required amount of time. Even the very best of ideas can't sustain themselves indefinitely, and ""Squid Game"" is the umpteenth repetition of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1924) by Richard Connell. Combine this with Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" (1939) and you have the bases for many of the horror and adventure stories and films of the last 80 years. ""Squid Game"" doesn't add much that's new, besides some great set designs."
1161,Squid Game,"This series was really good!!! I didn't think I would like it. But after episode 2, it really picks up. So if you're anything like me and it don't pick up within min, give this one a try bc it's worth it. You cannot tell this hasn't happened in real life!! The acting is superb, they're definitely getting Emmys for this one, wow!!! I watched all of the episodes in one day."
1162,Squid Game,The show is at least 9/10 for me but the VIPs can't act at all. Their dialouge are super cringy and felt like they read it out from the script. Horrible acting from the VIPs ruined it for me.
1163,Squid Game,"This k-horror is a must see. Lots of blood and death this tale is not for those with weak stomachs. But this tale delivers more than just shock value. It's a commentary on high stakes gambling where there is no risk greater than death. Children's games harken innocence while greed and sacrifice decide each players fate. The ""VIP's"" are the weakest link, depicted as caricatures of selfish rapacious greed; but even with their one dimensionality there is a lot of social commentary to consider."
1164,Squid Game,"I have no criticism of this show, whatsoever. This will probably remain the best show I have ever seen for years.People say Breaking Bad... I say Squid Game."
1165,Squid Game,"As always, the show started awesome and ended in dissapointment.Its like this with all shows today."
1166,Squid Game,"Took me ages I know. I restarted it Halfway through after watching gganbu having realised i was massively underrating the show. Anyway just finished it.Squid game at its best is an excellent show. Consistently engaging, highly entertaining with some seriously phenomenal characters and writing. Unfortunately it is let down by a poor ending which is real shame but as a result of just how good the rest is id definitely say it is the best release I've seen this year (unpopular take)Here's a breakdown of my thoughts on each episodeRed Light Green Light - Really awesome opener. Sets the show up excellentlyHell - Great insight to the characters, slower but I like the paceThe Man with the Umbrella - so good, does so much right. I love itStick to the team - Also awesome, great cliffhangerA Fair World - Builds on the arching drama really well. Definitely didn't cry when old man wet himselfGganbu - Perfect. Genius piece of Tv writing. So emotional, aggravating and uncomfortable to watch. The show at its bestVIPs - So good, probably my second favourite. Looks gorgeous as wellFront Man - Great penultimate episode. It's length works well here. SadOne Lucky Day - Bad.Overall 8/10It has easy 10/10 moments but the finale just isn't good."
1167,Squid Game,"I don't get the hype for this show, honestly. It's very predictable, and it doesn't feel original. I just feel like I was watching one of the ''Saw'' movies. However, I like the idea behind the show in an apparent criticism of capitalism society and billionaires in general. It can be a very tough reality to confront, but this show portraits the bad side of capitalism in a very depressing and violent way, as it should be.On the other hand, it's not that hard to criticize capitalism, it's actually a very easy target. It's almost a trend these days, with all other TV shows and movies addressing this topic. I'm not saying it is bad to address this topic at all. I'm really glad this is being discussed, I just feel that this topic isn't enough to make this show original or surprising in any aspect. It's surely not a virtue of this show.Squid Game tries to build tension on violence and death, just like GOT did. But GOT's tension is genuine, well-built, and really unpredictable (unless you read the books). The tension here is almost useless, since we all know how this is going to end, and the characters death become almost trivial throughout the show. We know who will likely win and who won't. Sure, there are some surprises/plot twists along the way regarding the characters, but it's not that mind-blowing anyway.Violence scenes are excellent! It's raw, straightforward and merciless. I also liked the cliffhanger in the end. I like how the main character wasn't conformed with all the violent events, and how he evolved to a more mature and dangerous person.The first season of Squid Game didn't impress me, but there's room to improve in possible future seasons. This show needs another season, not only because of the cliffhanger, but the narrative needs a better outcome, and the main character deserves a better legacy."
1168,Squid Game,"This is high octane, edge of your seat! I love Korean shows and movies so I wasn't surprised at the violence, however, the violence was waaaaaaaaay over the top. This show really tugged at the heart strings, only to be slapped in the face with another violent end. All in all, I think the movie is an interesting concept. It sure has twisted my memories of childhood games!"
1169,Squid Game,"Terefic irrelevent boring irritating
i am watching this show from last 12 days and finally today i end this series
genrally i play vedios on normal speed but for this i want 2x to 4x speed and finally i completed this show with infinite suffering thanks to my patience level one last thing i goona say about this web is increase my patience level."
1170,Squid Game,"The first episodes were predictable, and the last four very uncertain. The end indicates that there will be another season, which I sincerely hope for."
1171,Squid Game,"This reminds me of a lot of things; a mix of As gods will, Alice in borderland, Battle Royale, Kaiji etc. If you enjoyed those then you would like this series as well. Squid game is fascinating and keeps me on edge/ wanting more after each ep with how the games are set out it showcases a variety of Korean-style childhood games that I've never seen before. At the same time it can be a Melodrama that manages to provoke you emotionally and although it may be predictable at times it's definitely a enjoyable experience to watch. Not to mention players are interesting, with complex backstories and personalities. From a poor/ in-debt background they all strive with the same motive of money but at what cost? It's amusing to watch how everything unfolds but at the same time making you question a lot of things. I'm quite positive with how it left off that there might be a season 2 since there are a few things yet to be answered and revealed if so I wouldn't be surprised. Hats off to all the the people working on this project and the wonderful actors. Definitely felt like a roller coaster ride. Personally thought it was exciting, intense and satisfying watch for those who like this type of genres."
1172,Squid Game,"Full of illuminati stuff, praising socialism, communism and even North Korea in occasions, Nothing unexpected from Netflix. The script is full of flaws and characters are raw and empty so badly. Good idea in general but another attempt by brainwashing machine of globalists to prepare everyone for apocalyptic New World order. A real embarrassment for south Korea by China-owned Netflix."
1173,Squid Game,Amazing writing. Amazing acting. Amazing music. Amazing concept. The main reason why we connect to the show is the human nature element. Can't say much. It's just a show which is really good with just 2 adult scenes in it (in case you are willing to watch it with your family). Don't miss this. This is not the best show but a really good show.
1174,Squid Game,I just imagined this type of game in my mind only but never thought it will become real in series. And this series plays so much with our feelings for example - we want both players alive but one has to die and it hurts so much. I loved and enjoyed this series so much but the last three episodes were hurtful. And VIPs ruined it because of what shitty acting had done the VIPs. I am happy with the ending because Season 2 of Squid games will be coming soon next year.
1175,Squid Game,"Its definitely a 10/10 series, amazing performance by all actors!! Waiting for season 2 eagerly."
1176,Squid Game,"Despite all the cringey memes and Instagram/TikTok trends that made the momentum of this show tired, the show itself is absolutely brilliant. I watched this show twice in full already, both the Korean version and the English Dub version. Both were actually really well done. I normally don't like English dubs, but they actually did a very good job with the dub for this one (minus the red light green light song and a couple of the translations). All the characters are really enjoyable and played their parts so well. When you see them in talk in interviews, you can see they difference and how well they played their parts. They're all so likeable and I hope some of them can return for season 2 somehow. Even the 'villains' are a hilarious and the sweetest people in real life, so you know how well they acted. The makeup and costumes and sets were brilliant. When you watch the behind the scenes footage on how they filmed it and the emotion they actors put into it, it's just so fascinating.The story is both light-hearted and funny, but also very dark, deep and emotional. During and after each game, you feel the intense fear and grief that the characters are feeling and as the story progresses you feel that same uncomfortable feeling they do. The story has very deep undertones to the downfalls of how our society is and how the system takes advantage of our weaknesses and sets us up to fail.On top of the story, the story on how the show was created was really beautiful as well. How the creator wrote those show many years ago and no one would take it or fund it, how he lost teeth from all the stress, how he had no money. It's almost like he was one of the players in the game itself.I'm really looking forward to Season 2. I'm a bit worried though, because the creator didn't plan for a season 2 as he wasn't expecting it to be a global phenomenon, and he said he won't be writing season 2 on his own, it would be a team of people. So we'll see if they can keep the same deep quality and not ruin it."
1177,Squid Game,"The best way to describe this show is the feel of black mirror and the politics of parasite. I loved every second of this show from the characters,plot to the games,although I loved this show but please don't make a season 2 make this a one time thing it ended great and I feel like a season 2 would just drag the premise. Don't fall into the trap of other shows where the first season was brilliant but the later seasons were downgraded in quality."
1178,Squid Game,I feel very entertaining after saw this show.Very good web series.Thanksgiving to all team of squid game.Everyone should watch this show.The old man done a great job in this show.
1179,Squid Game,"One of the best series by netflix , Korean worked very hard and rollercoaster ride for cinema lovers , it can beat money heist easily."
1180,Squid Game,"This show seems simple at first, but later expands what makes it great. With endearing characters, story, and an interesting take on human nature. Showing what anyone would do for money. However, like a lot of dubs, there is a bit on uncoordinated lips. But that can be expected."
1181,Squid Game,"The Cinematography is good, not boring as a series."
1182,Squid Game,"I read disappointment from many about the finale of the series. A more decisive finale would just have ended the story (and the series). This ending, instead leaves the door ajar for a continuation. I hope this happens."
1183,Squid Game,"I have been a fan of Korean cinema for a long time. Thanks to Parasitie, Korean cinema has been deservedly been propelled.This show is the epitome of cinema from that part of the world. It is poigant, sad, violent, contains moral choices..it has it all. Throughly enjoyable. I do and don't want another season..it can easily be left where it ended."
1184,Squid Game,No story no script no emotion actors are really good this series made for children overrated series there is no goosebumps movement actors are brilliantly worked in low story bases series.
1185,Squid Game,"Character development was strong in this one. I binged thgis one so it really absorbed my mindscape for a few days. Left with a lot of ""what would i do if i was that person?"" the best character was the old man. Im sure if they knew of the success of this mini series they would have invested more in the props and locations."
1186,Squid Game,"Fun, different and inventive. Still have questions at the end of it all, which hopefully season 2 will shine some light on. Feel like they could've done it in fewer episodes with less filler, but still a lot of fun."
1187,Squid Game,"The Squid Game is the best series I have ever seen. Very cool storyline with unexpected twists and turns. The actors played their roles very well. The concept and the photography are top notch. Thank you for such a cool series, I advise everyone and look forward to continuing."
1188,Squid Game,"Simply a production of the highest level that inserts Korea as a power in the cultural industry. Excellent photography, outstanding characters, well-chosen cast, fantastic story, with a critique of liberal democracy. In my view, the main key to understanding the production and which I don't usually read in the reviews is that the viewer at the end wants the game to continue in a continuation of the series, that is, you and I are perverse just like the financiers and gamblers who entertain themselves by watching these deadly games."
1189,Squid Game,"Hey Hwang Dong-Hyuk you can't have it both ways!!This is the real world, this is real people being selected from the real world to enter a surreal world to play a game fabricated by real people who pay a lot of money to be entertained.The final demonstration of this unarguable truth is when 456 - a real flesh and blood human remember on planet earth - decides he is going to take a stand, be a whistleblower, and bring the whole grotesque vileness tumbling down.That's all fine BUT ...there is one episode where the real world crosses over into the surreal world of Squid Game, and that is when the VIPs come to town.This would have been a very difficult episode to pull off using ""real people"", think about that for a minute, the all too close to home, close up ugliness of it, so the director WIMPS OUT and we do not get ""real people"", we get an arm's length absurdist parody of the repulsive rich, a staged nonsense drawn from the director's imagination to replace that which was just too damned difficult to make real.Nuh! That's not ok.Hence so many people here complaining about the VIPS poor acting. But it not POOR ACTING that is the problem, the elephant in the room is the sleight of hand and dishonest depiction of the VIPS full stop.You can't do that, and maintain a unified aesthetic, artistic integrity.Make an MC Escher style world full of every kind of fantasy and excess by all means, knock yourself out, but don't ALSO bring the real world - the real world THAT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING THE SHOW inside and turn it into masked comedy.You'd have been better off keeping observers off the premises altogether, shadowy mysterious figures watching from afar via technology.THAT would have been REAL... and may I say, a lot more spooky.Overall, I'm truly amazed at the plaudits for this show, the raving, the buzz, the wow!!! The omggggs!!! The attention on SM....yes it is bingeable, it is easily addictive, and there are some great performances too, but I honestly think COVID has left the community desperate for distraction for people to be responding to this as they are.Bit sad really.Can only give this one star, because as the old saying goes, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link."
1190,Squid Game,"Certainly an intense experience. I would add Horror to the list of genres this resides in. It probably has more in common with SAW and HOSTEL than HUNGER GAMES, nonetheless it is original in its overall aesthetic. The series could have benefitted by shortening it by a couple of episodes and leaving out certain subplots and storylines of characters that die a few minutes after we learn a great deal of their backstory through long soliloquy's . None of that overwhelms the overall impact however and I highly recommend it."
1191,Squid Game,"8 out of 9 episodes were fantastic. I was addicted. Would have given it a10 but the last episode👎🏻
Come on guys! Make the wrap up understandable and satisfying."
1192,Squid Game,"Everyone is a pawn (or ""horse in a race"") in the game of capitalism, the pursuit of profit at the expense of all else. Squid Game is a grand allegory, told as if a fable by which children learn the fundamentals of right and wrong.There are no heroes here, everyone who plays the game is a victim, losing something essential to a fundamental of life: that happiness is not revealed in what you own or control, but in how much appreciation and concern one has for the world, for others, during one's short life.Yet even the 'good' people cannot escape the snap jaws of the capitalist world - those who benefit from it become twisted and inhumane exactly as much as those who are sucked dry to feed its insatiable thirst for more and more and more.Squid Game is fascinating, heartbreaking, never mawkish, preachy or trite - it reveals the animality of a system where only a very small few 'win', and even these winners bring nothing of actual value to the world. So everyone loses. And the moral seems to be, the players will change, but as long as the game exists, it will continue to be played.At one point the players are told that 'here everyone has an equal chance'. This summed it up for me - the two-edged sword, on the one hand a lie; that any beggar can become a king with hard work and the right connections, on the other - the truth - that we are all capable of the brutality, egotism and rabid self-interest required to gain enormous wealth.Watch it in the original Korean with subtitles on. The acting is superb and the English dub is awful."
1193,Squid Game,The characters are extremely unlikable the acting is absolutely a joke it's almost like a five year old wrote out the script and the dialogue. There is nothing likable about this show it's absolutely a joke I think people are giving it high ratings just to be annoying.
1194,Squid Game,"It is an ok show nothing that great - typical netflix show.Feel free to watch it, but let the the high rating/reviews inflate your expectations
Nearly everything was really predictable and the things that weren't were of no consequence."
1195,Squid Game,"A very slow series, there are many much better Korean series/ films if you want to watch foreign films. Just don't bother with this one - the acting is poor, the dubbing is awful, and the ending is an absolute mess!"
1196,Squid Game,"Wonderful acting and great suspense, old wine on new bottles maybe, but tapped in a way that will surprise you all the time.Please watch it with the Korean voice acting and not the dubbed English, no matter your native tongue, it will give the show much more depth for you.I absolutely loved this series until the episode where the vip's came along and almost completely ruined it for me. Still good, but they took it down at least a few stars."
1197,Squid Game,"I watched this because of the hype. Well, I was disappointed, to say the least. There were some good moments, the cinematography and sound design are pretty good. But all of the rest is very weak. The script is horrible with stupid dialog. Folks are horrified from the deaths they have witnessed and then 5 minutes later they are laughing and chatting nonsense to each other. They always forget where they are and what's happening and then get super surprised when seeing the next challenge. Pair this with B-movie-style acting. Over-dramatization of emotions during simple dialogs and then complete indifference to the events that just unfolded minutes ago. And don't get me started on that woman who slept with the gangster.The place feels like a caricature from old Bond movies with a laughable supervillain. The VIPs with the animal masks? Seriously? The minions in Fortnite costumes with symbols taken from the PlayStation controller... It's so cringeworthy.... Above all that is the grand scheme of the plot with zero twists. All movie is predictable from start to end and because of that, some scenes are so long I wanted to stop watching. The moment when the frontman unveils his face and we knew who he is like 2-3 episodes ago... And then he slowly takes off the mask so that we can see a random guy. So dramatic I laughed. I think I know exactly what will happen in season 2, but I don't even care."
1198,Squid Game,If only it could be watched without the VIPs. Seriously a major let down and distraction from the core premise of the show. Boo.The show overall is good. Not believable in how the masked men behave inconsistently towards the players.
1199,Squid Game,Acting is good no doubt but this thing will make you selfish and voilent . The man who wrote this story should be punished for writing such a plot . Human life exploitation at it's best .
1200,Squid Game,This is a hard movie to watch but something that could happen in real life too. Good acting by the main characters.
1201,Squid Game,"I loved this, I'm a fan of shocking movies. Example original old boy, audition and ichi the killer.Hard to find anything like them. So I was happy to see something along those lines on netflix! Very enjoyable, only part that didn't allow me to give a ten was the vips I feel there could have been more to them BUT I'm wondering is this open for more series in their regions? Games that they host? Who knows... but I'm excited for more... I hope it goes ahead!"
1202,Squid Game,"One thing I was sure of, was that the Battle Royale genre was ridden with poor scripting and substandard acting, so I never did watch any of them. And having heard Squid Game being heaped together with Battle Royals I couldn't care less about, I begun watching with low expectations. And what a horribly pleasant surprise it was! You'll get character depth and story structures you wouldn't expect from the genre. Maybe it won't live up to the hype for Battle Royal aficionados, but for the casually curious ones, you need not to worry that this will be a waste of your time. I gave 10 out of 10 as Squid Game expands the survival horror genre in general, and obviously raises the bar for the sub genre of Battle Royals."
1203,Squid Game,"Great series! Story, characters, setting, and mood was nice. Except for the actors who played the VIPs. That was terrible acting and it could have been better casted and directed. But all in all, season 1 was great!"
1204,Squid Game,A refreshing mixture of many genres to form a brand new standard!No spoilers here because this is one to watch and explore for yourself!I'd just say this much that I watched this by chance and been watching for 6 hours straight!Definitely one to watch!
1205,Squid Game,"I appreciated the importance of Squid Game taking on the inequality and cruelty of Capitalism for the first half of this series. Then things got muddled. The plot becomes full of holes and dead ends. We find out that the only motivation for the Game was some bored, over-rich friends looking for fun, That's all. I was really expecting something original.Most of the characters never developed any subtlety. We are left with the Bully, the Greedy guy, the Crazy Lady, the Cool but Wise Young Women, the Clever Old Man, the Loser with a Heart of Gold, and a hundred Heartless Minions with no apparent backstory. And the VIPs were just comical.Squid Game cries out for a second season to explain all the lingering questions about the origins and motivation of the people who started and ran the Game. But I don't think I care enough about that to sit through another few hundred horribly cruel deaths again."
1206,Squid Game,"It is a fantastic thriller series. First episode itself set the tone of the series and throughout the series I didn't have a dull moment. Now, I am eagerly waiting for its sequel."
1207,Squid Game,"Over 400 ""life losers"" are drawn into a violent game from which there can only be one survivor, who will walk away with $45.6 billion Won (South Korean) or $38 million (US) dollars. They are sequestered in a lockdown building from which they cannot escape. Every day is a different contest - the winners advance to the next day's game - or they die. Simple. The contestant population is shaved down daily and winners develop complex relationships with their fellow survivors, running the gamut from helping each other stay alive to killing one another. Life is very iffy: one's closest companion may kick them into a pit. This program pulled me right in - I was immediately permeated with ""what would I do?"" emotions. I had to force myself to watch only two episodes a day so I could savor this program overnight.10 stars from me. Easy."
1208,Squid Game,To me the highest point of this series was when it reaches the tug off war stage 😀simply superb !!
1209,Squid Game,"Squid vs SawSquid Game was dark, weird and I wanted more!The games reminded me of the Saw movies - live or die, make your choice... or in this case; play properly or die, make your choice.Most games were exciting, except for the marble game. I found that a little bit long and the players waffled on a bit with their personal stories. (I fast forwarded those parts).Bring on more games, less waffling on, and more strategic twists rather than the in depth story lines of the players involved.If you're bringing out a season 2, I'd love to see intense games that go for longer."
1210,Squid Game,I was expecting more from all the reviews. It's a good mid ground show. Nothing ground breaking but not bad either.
1211,Squid Game,"So there's no denying that this is an entertaining show but come on people - what's all this hype about?!? The storyline itself is fairly unoriginal - although different...there are other movies based on a similar story (people playing a game against each other, resulting in death, secret societies, delving into humanities primal response to self-preservation etc.) and for the most part I found it totally predictable! Again - don't get me wrong...I enjoyed it - it was easy watching and a pleasant enough weekend binge but I genuinely do not understand the hype...there are far greater shows that deserve more credit than this. So in conclusion - watch it for yourself...but don't expect it to be mind-blowing.P.s. The dubbing is awful - please watch it in Korean with subtitles...much, much better!"
1212,Squid Game,"Imagine Game of Thrones. The first 6 seasons were awesome. Well the first 6 episodes of Swuid Game were too. Then it got dumb. Lost the plot, and resolved zero plot lines."
1213,Squid Game,"I started watching episode 1, got about halfway through and turned it off because of the terrible Voice over work and over acting. But I kept reading things about it being so good so I turned it back on and I did get sucked into it. But maybe it was more like a train wreck that I just couldn't look away from. Since I'm left not knowing whether I even liked it or not, I gave it 5 stars."
1214,Squid Game,Really bad ending 👎👎👎🏻 Good start bad ending. I have nothing more to say . Why the he'll does he want to return after he has won so much ??? He should instead pay his depts and enjoy the life .
1215,Squid Game,"Thought it'd be more intellectual but just a lot if violence, gore, bad acting, and more violence. Called the main plot line in the first show. If the games were more thoughtful, this could have been good. And suicide so many times? Organ harvesting? Geez, check more boxes.Skip it."
1216,Squid Game,"I have to say i have mixed feelings. I watched it with my wife, while we were also watching Sneaky Pete .We were doing it one episode from each one. My wife was grabbed by this one and wanted to saw the end, i was less enthusiastic about it.The plot is reasonable , the actors are good with a bit of overacting here and there ,the korean it´s a weird language and i saw it on korean with subtitles. I think this is more hyped because it came from Korea and people tend to find it exotic.Overall to me it´s a 6. For my wife i think she would give a 8 or 9."
1217,Squid Game,"The acting and character development from the main cast is outstanding! The storyline was AMAZING. I was hooked straight away.It would have received a 10 if the VIP acting was better, they were shockingly bad and sometimes hard to ignore.And there were also little things that were never finished/explained:
The coughing morse code from 28 to 29.The battery life of 29's phone, even the leader uses a landline.The police chief definitely caught some of what the police guy (29) was saying on the phone. Why was no back-up whatsoever sent to his location?Why did the last guy give up after just being bit in the leg but 456 was stabbed twice and able to fight and win? I'm guessing that he just gave up and wanted 456 to win?The married couple that returned and acted shocked that only one of them could leave alive. They knew there could only be one winner in the end.I was super gutted that the girl was randomly impaled by glass (why did they blow up the glass, it could have killed all three finalists, risking losing a final winner).Was 001 called number 1 as he was secretly the winner. Did he secretly want to let 456 win? Did he allow it to happen? Isn't that going against the ""fairness"" of the games?456 winning Squid Game as a child in the first scene in the pilot episode, totally ruined the series, I KNEW that would be the final game, so it was OBVIOUS he was going to win. I still enjoyed the ride, but it was something that at least should have had a flash back too during the last game, as I haven't seen anyone else make this comment; did they forget about it?His hair looked awful red. That is all.Why did he suddenly become impulsive and want to hunt down the gamers? Will their be a season 2? I don't understand how he thinks he can take them down; the police don't believe him and the leader/VIPs are billionaires so can hide everything/kill everyoneHe abandoned his daughter AGAIN.He was going to ditch the prize money AGAIN.When the first group of people were released, the prize money was meant to go to the bereaved families, but when the majority returned, the prize money remained. Does this mean they were lying? (because they secretly lied about a lot!) or was this a plot hole oversight?The leader said to keep an eye on those who didn't return to the game from the first round, but if I'm correct, nothing came of this? I was expecting it to flash outside every now and then, tracking those people down?One of the masked gang mentioned to 29 that if the top door in the tunnel ladder thing opened, the bomb would go off... 29 opened it later in the series whilst grinning at the leader, but no bomb went off? I was expecting a massive explosion to go off at any point as this was planted in our heads, but never happened. Bit disappointed with that.How did that annoying woman survive? When asked to partner up, she was left alone, why did they let her survive? But she was a weak underdog? That makes no sense... she survived the round but didn't have to compete?The police man that just dumped the diving gear on the rocks (that was being tracked), I kept thinking ""chuck it in the water so they're thrown off"" but no, he left it there and was easily found.Another police man one... He was trying to find his brother who had been recently untraceable. His brother was the leader... who had clearly been there a long time. How does this work? Or had he only ""disappeared"" during the latest games. This definitely needed more explanation.Now that I think about it, there were A LOT of plot holes, but during watching it and before I started analysing it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.I would recommend and likely watch again! I love geeking out like this; that's how I know when I've loved something; when I can't stop thinking and analysing it!"
1218,Squid Game,Quite the unique show. I was hooked from the first episode. Haven't binged something in a long time but could not stop this one. Totally out of the box creatively. Loved it. Give it a watch.
1219,Squid Game,"It was good but we live in a bandwagon society so of course people are making it seem better than what it actually is. The ending was lame, which brings the rating down."
1220,Squid Game,"This is not as provocative as they want this to be. Many books and stories have the same genre of ""all humans are capable of doing bad things when pushed too hard""."
1221,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet."
1222,Squid Game,"Held in suspense throughout, a furious desire to click on ""next episode"" as soon as it ends ... The atmosphere totally shifted between the cruelty of the games and the aesthetics of the naive and childish colored sets, as well as the very soundtrack. Focused on classical music while acts of a nameless barbarism take place before our eyes... To watch in original version even if we do not understand anything in Korean so as not to miss the great actingThe ending foreshadows a season 2 while being relatively surprising as to the identity of the creator of the game. A few small questions remain, but nothing important enough to be disturbing.A great discovery that I recommend without hesitation if the big spurts of blood don't bother you too much."
1223,Squid Game,"Warning do not watch the trailers do not read the reviews
Just watch don't spoil it for yourself
It is a must watch series
In the beginning it was slow but as everything kicked off and started omg I was on the Edge of my seat non stop binge watched it all I had work the next morning at 2am I couldn't stop watching I had no sleep.So must effort put into making it!"
1224,Squid Game,"I really like Squid Game. Terrific acting, visually amazing, and fully engaging with a pure-hearted main character walking through hell. Also, the directing was outstanding. I hope there will be another season."
1225,Squid Game,"I managed to watch it for 15-20 minutes. Bad acting. Hysterical.In the first 15 minutes you should at least get some indiction that this may be worth watching. It could be a surprise (like the first minutes of the ""Travellers"" or ""The Blacklist"") or the beautiful settings (like in the Shire in LOTR) or familiar but at same time alluring and somewhat sinister (like the first Alien movie and the Fargo series).This is nothing like that. I can't imagine it becomes any better. And then keeping in mind that some reviewers even think the first episode is okey, while it then goes worse. Brrrr.... Stay away."
1226,Squid Game,"It's decent but does it justify the hype? I'm not too sure. I have found Korean shows/movies (Squid games, Parasite) to be slightly overhyped for some reasons. They are different and creative, for sure. Well done to Netflix's marketing team."
1227,Squid Game,It's very exciting and unexpectedly super! Watched twice in a row. Don't hesitate and check it out.
1228,Squid Game,Not at all bad. But went down pretty fast. Horrible vips horrible end to the story. Very flawed but still interesting and intriguing.
1229,Squid Game,It's worth a watch but the VIPs were terrible in acting.
1230,Squid Game,"I found it amazing through and through. Very emotional, I felt horrible during every episode but I kept watching and found the suspense amazing. Well done."
1231,Squid Game,I enjoyed watching the series but it's just way overrated.
1232,Squid Game,Absolutely amazing show. A must watch for people that can handle it. Episodes are always interesting.
1233,Squid Game,"First the VIP acting was hilariousSecond Netflix typical this show does not end after one season (at least it's clearly implied), even tho it clearly should or could have ended. I can't stand it when great concepts are ruined like that!"
1234,Squid Game,No matter how the direction of this show is but it's not at all good to villify the life so casually.(In the last episode they are trying to justify it too.) Wrote this because review was short.
1235,Squid Game,"Life is no longer any fun when you are too broke, but so it isn't either when you are too rich. Those two extreme worlds meet.Money is not what makes life worth living, after all - could you do whatever it would take to achieve a big amount of money so you never would have to think amount making more money in your life?The old man says, fun is what makes life worth living, when you are a kid you can spend hours and hours and completely forgetting the time, by playing fun games with your friends. When you are too rich those small things you had before that gave life pleasures, such as food, etc. Just wont reach anymore it won't be enough. -Do you lose motivation too much, when you have a table full of almost endless possibilities that you now no longer have to work for in order to slowly achieve?But instead to just live in the present, have enough in the little things in life, and with good company?They are just free to be, just exist, no stress, or... so that was a reality as a kid that is, according to this tv series.Another man says: I am not a horse, we are not horses. For you to bet money on. Our lives are not for your entertainment. (so he did himself in the past as a way of an ""income"", ironic huh.)
When rich men get too powerful and too bored with life, when life is too easy; even so when one of them at least risked his own life more or less by participating in the game himself as well."
1236,Squid Game,Better watch Escape Games type movies that woudl save your time and atleast its like not full waste of time but if you don't watch movies alot then that would not be the case then could make your days.
1237,Squid Game,Am I mad that I watched it? Nah. Would I recommend to a friend? Also nah. I don't get the hype.
1238,Squid Game,"Absolutely fantastic series. Strong memories of the classic 00's Japanese cult classic Battle Royale.In a strange way it's a comforting season to watch. (Now, hear me out!) As we are aware of how many games are to be played, we are able to prepare ourselves each episode for the next game.Of course somewhat predictable storyline with the detective brother and front of house man. That's the second storyline, we need to distract us from the main.I'm not the only one who cried their eyes out when Ali the old man died. We wanted to the good guys to win!Although the protagonist isn't too likeable at the beginning, his character growth is excellent and looks badass with red hair.Cinematography was beautiful. The mash up of bright and dark colours, went so well with themes of the show.Like most films/shows, it's better in the language filmed in, with subtitles. The dubbed version was absolutely fine too!Ending was brilliant. Iconic anime antihero going to get some vengeance.Hoping for another season, great show. RIP sweet Ali!"
1239,Squid Game,"Must watch. In my personal opinion this is one of the best series I have watched. It takes you breathless from start to the end. Every episode is a trill and enjoyment. I wish american series are like this, but unfortunately most of them these days try to milk it to the end and spoil everything they make. I am so glad that someone actually rise above Hollywood. It was about time !!!"
1240,Squid Game,"We make poor choices in life. That's the truth. But we must learn from them.This show is about a man, Gi Hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. That's the first episode. Instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.This show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. Which makes it... nonsense. Completely.I'll explain why. From the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for Gi Hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. He's gambling-addict I get that. But to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. Fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that Gi Hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, Gi Hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.Now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. But after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.This is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. Supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. Only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.It gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. As some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.Only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.Fairness is thrown out the window.Rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)Sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.One ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?In the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. Poor choices."
1241,Squid Game,"Idk why there is so much hype about this series. There is only thrill in one episode where they have to cross bridge made of glass. Thats it. No any thrill , slept 3 times between episode 1-4.. restarted again and finished after 4th attempts."
1242,Squid Game,This series started very strong. The first 2 episodes were excellent.It had enough jeopardy to make it interesting and the main characters overall were well conceived with some nice twists to the story.Unfortunately this was inconsistent and later on some episodes were a little dull with some predictable scenes and some great ideas that were suddenly cut short. Overall I would recommend this show as a decent watch although it's going to have to work hard to tighten up the story telling if there is indeed going to be a sequel.
1243,Squid Game,"It's was great until
The last episode
it deserves 8 but let's give them a chance for now."
1244,Squid Game,"Seriously don't watch this. You really don't want to waste your time watching this. It wasn't bad until the last episode, but they made the worst finale you've ever seen to get season 2. Trust me and don't watch."
1245,Squid Game,"Binged it in 2 days..just couldn't get off my chair ! It's addictive.... Many life lessons and harsh realities around how 'money' manipulates our whole life, expressed in a simple way.""Those who have too much money and those who have too less are both in the same boat...."""
1246,Squid Game,I can't wait to forget about this show so I can watch it all over again. Yep the actors who played the VIPs sucked I just wanted to skip those parts and some other boring bits but you have to have them for the storyline but the games... I'm never giving anything away. I reacted out loud every time a game was revealed and yelled at the screen for them to choose something else even though I was wrong every single time. No one I know was willing to watch this show so it killed me to have no one to discuss it with. That's why I do these reviews.
1247,Squid Game,"For me is the best Kdrama in Netflix. So refreshing, thrilled, gore at the same time. Is really mind blowing. 2 thumbs up for this drama!"
1248,Squid Game,"My God the actors who potrayed the VIP people cannot act. I cringed everytime they said a line. It felt like they were just reading them. Even the intonation was off. It was like when we were kids and had to read a play in class and we exagerated the intonation. Terrible, just awful."
1249,Squid Game,"The first 6 episodes had me questioning whether this show was a masterpiece and one of Netflix's best pieces. Everything from the acting to the cinematography to the writing was incredible and really dragged u into this world in which there was no escape. And then I watched episode 7. The VIPs were awful and served no purpose to the story what so ever and seemed like a waste of time with cringe humour and simply bad acting. The episode 7 game was also taken straight from ""kaiji"" an anime. They attempted to cram so many plot twits and turns to the point where it wore down the finale so much it was boring to watch. The main plot twist was incredibly predictable and honestly if it had a simpler ending it would be an easy 10/10 and one of the best Netflix shows they've put out ever. I do recommend it but by the end you don't really care about the lead character and it just feels odd (not in a good way). This show was so close to being an absolute bombardment of genius tv show making but the last few episodes took that title away. All in all a solid show but just a bad ending. It doesn't ruin the show it's just annoying to see such a brilliant show take such an awful ending."
1250,Squid Game,"I cannot praise this series enough. At first, I didn't like some of the over-reaction from many of the characters but this might just be my own cultural failings. But, I loved the way the characters developed and interacted, their differing views and what they each 'brought' to the series. I agree with the other reviewers that E6 is just superb - it is a masterpiece of story telling in a way that Hollywood tends to forget. The acting was so good. All in all, this series has totally entertained me and surpassed my expectations. Thoroughly recommended."
1251,Squid Game,This is a best game series what i saw. I had a curiosity from first episode.
1252,Squid Game,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. It's a below average show, with average performances. The english dubbing is horrendous, which further proves that Netflix didn't have much faith in the production, didn't make much effort on sub titles and dubbing."
1253,Squid Game,Average series at best. Not sure how people have rated this so highly. I found it a snooze fest.Too many ridiculously boring and unrealistic conversations dotted throughout with only a small number of truly memorable moments.
1254,Squid Game,This show was amazing...What the beautiful show understand ing and the game of the people money playing game and earn money...And money this show was good in this game show...Good acting good camera work good direction.
1255,Squid Game,Unexplainable Classic one. And one of the best from Korea.
1256,Squid Game,"This show is really good. If you like horror and thriller u are going to love this. I mean the plot is outstanding and the acting was well almost flawless. The game really messes with your head and u don't know who to trust. I mean the logic inside it is dope. It is survival of the fittest,the series actually made me think that more than one winner can emerge. My favorite game was the glass game .I mean that part was really tense. I also like the fact that they killed of all the characters apart from Jamie sung or whatever his name is. I liked some of the other characters but killing some of the main characters, i did not see that coming. It caught me off guard. Last but not least,the plot twist was crazy i never expected it to be the old man it was mind blowing but then it made a lot of sense because he was player number 1. Well let's get to the rotten part. Some parts were predictable,like the part where that girl sacrificed herself for the other girl and the part where the guy in the mask was the detective's brother. Other than those two events,it was a really good show. I don't really like the way it ended tho i mean if it ended like that's i don't see any point for a season 2. Well it is a solid 8/10 for me."
1257,Squid Game,"Watch the entire series in 2 sitting, great acting and entertaining. The story is a bit dull, it felt like something I have seen a million time and the twist at the end is no surprise. Overall ok for those that have some free time and want to spend it on watching an over the top acting series."
1258,Squid Game,Too much violence and a very weak plot. I have better things to do with my precious time than watch this perversion.Please spend your money somewhere more rewarding.
1259,Squid Game,It is just a result of sick fantasy - that will definetly badly influence for generation.Playing child game and if you loose being killed? Where is fun here. Maddness.
1260,Squid Game,"Despite the hype, the plot is not original. It is a mixture of SAW, Cube, The platform and other similar films. It is kind of entertaining (if that could be said about a gore film) with a few nice plot twists, although some of them overstretched...Moreover, it depicts a version of the average South Korean with major financial issues, which I do not know if it is accurate or an exaggeration. Don't believe the hype. It is just another ""ok"" series."
1261,Squid Game,"Amazing cinematography, great idea, but I think it should've been a movie or a 5-episode mini-series. Definitely overhyped and overrated, at this moment it scores 8.2, same level as Money Heist which is clearly a much better show.It could be that English dubbing makes it less entertaining, but I also think that after the first 3-4 games writers have ran out of ideas."
1262,Squid Game,"This is a series from South Korea in mainly the Korean language
I am 99% sure the reason why the VIPs are talking the way they are is because of this
They are not acting bad, the acting is fine! What feels amiss to us is that they talk slowly and pronounce very clearly, and this is deliberate. They speak slowly and clearly because this show was intended for a Korean audience and not an US or even English speaking audience
and this is why it feels kinda off to those people
We are used to Netflix shows in US or British English where people speak perfect everyday English (whatever that means) and here they tried to ensure a non English speaker or someone with limited English skills can follow the VIP conversations
This is my theory I said what I said
Love this series and it's the best thing that's come off Netflix in a while so think for a minute and stop hating on this detail in an otherwise AWESOME show!"
1263,Squid Game,"Am I just getting old or was all of it painfully predictable? I believe only teenagers get excited with this show. It was extremely boring and I was able to tell what was coming next, apart from the type of games played. If I were Korean I would probably get that too. And what a cliché for the PIN card number!! I said it out loud before showing up on screen. Sorry but I don't see the hype with this. Not good enough."
1264,Squid Game,"Had me hooked. A very compelling story well written and acted, but please provide more accurate and consistent subtitles- surely this should not be a difficult task?"
1265,Squid Game,If the winning guy is feeling bad about his friends deaths why hasn't he helped their families for more than a year leaving them to live their miserable lives and they could've died by this time. It doesn't makes sense at all which is a crappy thinking by the director.
1266,Squid Game,"So good I can't even describe it , story acting everything is soooooo goooood !"
1267,Squid Game,"I have to agree that the VIPs were the worst part of this show lol
Even watching the show in Korean, you think they dubbed the VIP voices. Luckily for us they don't show their faces lol."
1268,Squid Game,Nostalgia. Reminded me of the 90s where I went through a phase of buying or renting every VHS tape that had a tartan label. From there I couldn't sleep for a while! This show is very good and will hook you in. However like other reviews it is slightly ruined by the cheezy B list VIP actors! It's like they ran out of actors late in the season and grabbed a few guys from a bar! Please take note of this for the next installment as it's an entertaining show.
1269,Squid Game,Very straight and boring nothing special to watch time wasting and i dont know what the f.... With ratings and reviews guys dont try this in your life...
1270,Squid Game,"Squid game serie was shot in a perfect angles, not even a single frame was shot in a noticeable error, direction was marvelous, casting is well selected, and yes i really loved the vip's characters, what do you want a serious straight personalities? Who is going to watch this games must be sick, pervert, unbalanced and full of sins.. So please stop
reviewing based on personal imagination. 9/10 first Korean serie ever watched."
1271,Squid Game,"Too bad Americans didn't produce this show because these Korean actors are terrible. So much yelling at each other for no reason. The acting reminds me the old Godzilla and Bruce Lee movies, and definitely not in a good way!"
1272,Squid Game,"I watched most of the series the back stories of the main characters were interesting. Some of the games, such as ""Red light, green light"" were, for me, way too violent and the violence way, way too graphic. I wish the series would have in some way revealed who the organizers of the ""games"" were and what purpose they had in staging the games, other than offering people in deep financial trouble a way to pay their debts. I wish the creators of the series would depicted the violence a little less graphic and disturbing. Maybe leaving the consequences of losing a gaming to the viewers' imagination. Violence and bloodletting aside, the series was good in a dark way. I can't say that I ""enjoyed"" the series, it was, however, interesting and a bit fascinating. The overall story I give it a 9 out 10, for the graphic violence a 4 out 10 too disturbing for my taste."
1273,Squid Game,"The start and the idea were very promising: how far do desperate humans go to acquire money, how fast can ""civilized"" people become murderers only because they are told what to do: according to the rules of ""the game"".I especially like the idea that the players were perhaps just naïve and innocent in the beginning but then made a conscious decision to join the game and therefore accepting the rules. The victims become offenders.The series seems and is very brutal. But you can see many parallels to many war crimes that have happened over and over again in concentration camps, war prisons, purges.Unfortunately, the plot and the ending seem incomplete. Also the acting was not always good. And what happened to the translation and subtitles? Very often they say complete different things and sometimes
they don't make sense at all.I am not sure yet, if the series should end after season 1 or if it needs a conclusion."
1274,Squid Game,"No dull moments, a show where the interactions and scenes really matter. If you watch carefully and pay attention the the players numbers there is a ton of foreshadowing.The acting is great, and Gi-hun's character growth is astounding. The games range from brutal, to jarring, to gut wrenching, to jaw dropping. Fairly gruesome.Terrific ending, but I can't imagine season 2 living up to this. Really great show can't recommend enough."
1275,Squid Game,"If you're on the fence, definitely give the show a try. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's definitely in my ""all-time favorites"" now.It was a really good show until one of the episodes, which elevated the show to the next level and cemented its place on my all-time favorites list. I would have given the series a 10, but I was disappointed with the ending, which is why I lowered the score to a 9.Despite the ending, I consider it a must watch, or at the very least, a must try."
1276,Squid Game,"Render and promote the gambler mentality -1
Lack of logic driving the plot -1
Contrived -1colorful scene +1
music +1
multiline story telling +1
costume design +1
Character design +1
thriller +1."
1277,Squid Game,"I just dont understand the point ...ok, great show
but when you finish, you will just be in shock asking ..but why ?It's certainly not a fun show to watch an laugh ...not sending any message for society or being good wins after all
the lead character is great actor... and all other character were so fit.But really ...why this is no.1 watched in the world right now ?"
1278,Squid Game,"Episode 6 started with 40 people, - 1 doctor, it bring us to number 39!And was about couples.... 38 ÷2=19+1 crazy lady ...it give us total number 20!However,
Season 7 ... was about 17 players only , 1 hanged its self, that brings Us to 16 players..those were crossing the bridge!3 people missing ! Not sure where :)"
1279,Squid Game,"Too many loose ends, ridiculous ending, not even B-level acting from the VIPs (special characters that show up later).Why colour your hair red? C'mon."
1280,Squid Game,"Really enjoyed this drama. Many of the reviews failed to pick up on the fact that the Frontman was a previous winner. He shot his brother, maybe he killed him, maybe not. But being through the game he could be regarded as ruthless. Looking forward to season 2 with Ring a Ring of roses, hopscotch, and maybe rounders."
1281,Squid Game,"There are some games you dare not play. This one is a real killer.The main protagonist is in desperate need to settle gambling debts and provide some much needed medical attention for his sick mother, only to be lured into a deadly game of winner takes all.There's only one problem. The competitors are only too willing to take that bet and stop at nothing to win the ultimate prize.Squid games is a moral dilemma with a sick and disturbing twist. What makes it compelling viewing is it's deliberate attempt to put the audience in a moral predicament and make them want to continue with the games despite doubts or reservations. Very very clever.Without giving anything away, watch it and consider, would you enter a game that gauranteed death or ultimate success?"
1282,Squid Game,It's just paradoxically unbelievable how many people give this perverse show high points and praise it for being well done! And that it has become that popular just after only several weeks!
1283,Squid Game,"I've just finished the last episode yesterday so I gave myself a day to recollect my thoughts.I don't want to write spoilers but as I see how big is the hype around it it's almost impossible to do so.If you haven't seen any movies with similar message then then you'll probably will give this one higher score for sure.I saw many and have to say that it is a solid 7/10
The character build up starts okay. Later episodes mess up this with the so called VIP's characters are bad. Add bad acting too.The conversations are a bit plain.The storyline is too predictable but not bad.The settings and visuals are very good.The games are good too.The ending is very meh.So these are my thoughts without spoilers.(I watched it in English as I read about it is a slightly different then the Korean original)"
1284,Squid Game,"We go through all the emotions in front of this series.One of the best show ever made, Netflix or otherwise."
1285,Squid Game,"It started with very high expectations of some society critics yet did not delivered any of them, just gambling and how humanity failing in some conditions which was better explained in Hunger Games. The human nature was the same, even player elimination followed it.There is also some scenes remains unexplained. Most important one the secrets behind the gamekeepers and their motives. There were also an important logical mistake behind the game rules, that might be avoided by gamekeepers motives but in the end, it remained as an error.The background sharing also gave the hint about which player will remain. Thus, trying to keep attraction on game status of leading role made me boring most of the time."
1286,Squid Game,Seen this story line a few times before. Pretty average to me. Reminds me of saw x hunger games. Didn't like the ending one bit and I'm failing to see what the moral of the story is. Definitely watchable and I did enjoy it just felt a little underwhelmed and disappointed at the end. I would love to see a US remake of this.
1287,Squid Game,So much to say about this incredible show! U hate him then u love him the main character gi hun is so complex all the characters are really. Their acting was amazing. I haven't seen that many Korean movies being from the US! But I love how u can read how they feel what their saying by their body language and tone. That is real acting. Love them. So many savage shocking and emotional moments! Whoever made this show u are a genius and deserve all the hype! I really dont understand the low ratings on here they are all lying to be cool bc this show is one of the most creative and brutal show I've seen in a long time. You guys did great job seriously and I hope there's a season 2 ! My fav characters are ali for obvious reasons ! And the bully. Those 2 actors did such a good job at really portraying the character! Watch this show!
1288,Squid Game,"Wtf was the vip acting, i cringed so hard. Rest of the movie was amazing."
1289,Squid Game,It was entertaining from start to finish! The ending was unexpected for sure. It kind of shows how people would act in real life for the money. I can't wait for season 2 because I absolutely loved this show! Recommended!!
1290,Squid Game,"Netflix's money on the Korean market finally paid off. The craze that the K-drama holds in worldwide it was only a matter of time to bang.All the hype, thrills and excitements aside, it is actually a pretty much predictable show where anyone with a common knowledge can predict it's final outcome correctly. You will be lying if you say you didn't see who is going to be the ultimate winner after just watching the pilot episode.The best thing about the show were those eventful journey, each and every round of the game were made with all possible thrills but yet again the ultimate results were some easy guess, it is what killed the core suspense of the show. However it doesn't decrease the addiction of finishing it overnight cause it had that ultimate Korean flavours. And when you know it's not only a mad epic game, the massages they tried to draw throughout the battles and emotional triggering was understandably the brightest side of its."
1291,Squid Game,"If you like internet execution videos, this is for you. This show stands for the unemphatic dulled mindset of many nowadays. I really don't understand the rating and hype around this trash."
1292,Squid Game,"You have to be really bored to watch it. The point behind the plot is really interesting especially in our days, but I wouldn't recommend it. I regret the time spending watching it."
1293,Squid Game,"Since you're here it's not really possible to tell you to go into the series not knowing anything about it, like I did. I read something about the VIPS being poor actors so I was constantly looking for them VIPS who eventually play a minor role at the end of the series.I see some people giving the series such a low score because of it, but in my opinion you're doing the series no good by that.I had such an amazing time with the series and tried not to finish it too fast. Eventually I finished it in 3 runs but I could finish it in one run it's that fun.The series never follow the American standardized way of a build up and the way choices are made. There were many moments where I expected something to happen where the opposite happend.The series is fast and original with great actors. Yes there is a lot of gore and violence, but fast enough you'll see it's not (solely) about that. Especially the episode Gganbu is some of the best I've ever seen in a series.If you're doubting about seeing it; give it a try, it is amazing!"
1294,Squid Game,"My title says it all. I suggest not to waste time on this overrated,overhyped cinematic garbage. I don't understand how this show became No.1 on Netflix. Many better shows are there on Netflix.Parasite,old boy are (2^256)^1000 times better than this trash."
1295,Squid Game,"If you like shallow, violent, teen-level, badly acted, badly dubbed, pretty much non-sensical drivel, that is derivative of many other movies / series, then this is for you ! Good luck getting your life back (because there are no refunds). I would give this zero...but it won't let me."
1296,Squid Game,Been waiting for such a show with that much suspense.I loved movies that had similar storylines like Would you Rather & Saw.This is the cream of the crop.I am waiting for the sequel. I would hope for the games to be more complex though.
1297,Squid Game,"Satanic filth that is glorifying sex, murder and other forms of violence and human misery.It is heartbreaking, shocking and disgusting how many people found this series entertaining. There is something seriously wrong with you if you find murder and human misery entertaining."
1298,Squid Game,"The symbolism behind this show is representative of The Dangerous Game and Eyes Wide Shut. Satanic billionaires that run all our world institutions bored with all they have desperate to feel any kind of emotion, which apparently comes from dehumanizing the masses and defiling the innocent.Those that find enjoyment are already lost to degeneracy. You are subconsciously being conditioned to accept this as normal. Pay attention.Is it a conspiracy theory if they are telling you what they are doing?"
1299,Squid Game,"The plot makes almost zero logical sense, but the show itself was still enjoyable, even in a comical way. The characters are shallow and lack any realistic motivations, so it's hard to feel anything for the story. I thought it looked pretty nice though, and in general the pacing was decent."
1300,Squid Game,"I watched this and thought, ohmigoshhh can this writer/director just keep going and going forever??? We need so much more in film and TV like this. Brilliant storytelling, cinematography, editing, everything. Bravo!!!!!!!"
1301,Squid Game,"At a time when hollywood try to make us all alphabet peoples with their trash, this tv show is original and entertaining. Koreans don't feel the need to play with the alphabet or to include all races of the whole world even when they are trash actors. Very refreshing, thank you korea."
1302,Squid Game,"First of all, what a series ! It looks so realistic compared to Alice in Borderland or Hunger Games. The VIPs acting were so bad and so fake ruining the contestants realistic acting.Some plot holes that are bugging me.1. What happened to the VIP guy that went to a room with the police and got photo taken with his phone? Did he threaten the Front Man for this incident or sue the game maker ?2. Why keeping all paper files of the squid Games? Everything are digitalized and looks so hi-tech with scanner, surveillance, etc. It doesn't make sense3. The old guy is already 'dead' in the marble game when he took of the mask and talked to the Front Man to greet the VIPs for him (ep.7). And at the same moment he explained (ep.9) to the Front Man he wanted to be down there join the game because it's more fun.What happened to the police and his phone whether all the photos were sent, we still don't know whether he is still alive or dead. Looking forward to season 2 (if there is any)"
1303,Squid Game,"This is a very good and interesting show as you would see how it took over the Internet. The show is very creative its like if SAW and the olpyics and Korea came together to make a game. The story lines is very good a creative and original the show had somewhat good characters and the show still had some comedy in it and the gore is really awesome. But here is when it goes down when the VIPs arrive; they are rich men that are responsible for Squid Game. When they arrive to the Island is when the show starts to get bad. The side plot with the police officer trying to find his brother was good up until the. The boss of the Squid Game is the policeman brother and he kills him, that was pretty stupid and pointless to have him die just to find out his brother was running the game at that time. The characters are really good and some are pretty funny but the writers in some of the games decided to screw them off and kill them off. The ending was probably the worst ending ever, the ending leaves off with 2 people left and they have to fight to the death in a game of Squid Game an old Korean hopscotch type game. And the ending where it leaves the last main character going to head to Los Angeles and not deciding but just staying and stopping Squid Game was kinda dumb."
1304,Squid Game,"When i first heard about this show, the first thing that came to my mind was Money Heist. And not exactly a robbery with a lot of unnecesary extra seasons. I thought huge budget spend on set, CGI and entertainment while the dialogue and storyline is given to the bunch of guys who knows how to do a lame predictible money maker series.I gave it a try and after watching the first episodes i started to think that i might made a judgement mistake.For a moment i was caught in it's mistery, unpredictable events and complex moral issues. You get to judge the competitors while at the same time realize you would probably do the same monstrosity's they are commiting. You see great acting, scenes that make you fantasize abouth the old days in South Korea when all of them where playing these infantile games without their debts, guilt and traumas. Even tough i'm no korean and never been in Korea, i felt nostalgia.Then, the show starts to have a few flaws in matters of coherence wich you try to ignore to keep having a pleasent experience. And for moments, you do. You try to understand the unnecesary plot about the young police who extremely easily breaks into a secret, dangerous facility runned by a cruel, wealthy organization who seem to have been running this games without problem for at least 2 decades. If that's not enough, the showrunners give you a terrible, incoherent explanation about his missing brother. It's almost like the tape of the series came by mistake with a few Mission Impossible scenes in the middle of it.There's a few scenes and cliché dialogues that makes you wonder if the series is looking to play safe as another hit in terms of Netflix views, or more as the daring, complex drama that was, at least, what i was expecting it to be.My other problem was that after 5 episodes i realized i wasn't empathizing too much with the characthers (with the exception of competitor 001, of course).And then i arrived at the Climax of the series. Episode 6. The moral concept is taken way beyond in this game as competitors pick their closest partner without knowing that they're gonna have to eliminate each other. You get to see the real face of all the characthers and the cast best perfomances. There's a lot of betrayal, hesitation, tension, characther exploration and development, and of course, the heartbreaking endings to each of the main eliminations. It was a perfect ending for Jy-Yeong, Ali and the old beloved 001.After that perfect episode, you are blown back to reality and the shows continues to fell apart.1.- One of the more interesting characthers of the show, Sae-Byeok get's fataly injured in the more stupid and meaningless way.2.- The plot of the police guy confirm's itself as totally unnecesary.3.- The closure of the games it's no much more than decent.4.- The plot twist about the old man being the host of the games is just stupid and gave bad closure to a characther who had originally a great arc.5.- The last scene where the protagonist doesn't take the plane in order to fight against the whole organization by himself?? Am I a watching John Wick or something? What about the daughter he promise not to lie anymore and take care of? It seems like they destroyed all his characther development.It seems like, this show had everything to be a cult classic and instead preferred to be the popular easy to digest Netflix hit i was expecting it not to be."
1305,Squid Game,"The design of the scenes and games, except for VIPs, directing, writing, etc., was excellent. The characterizations were very well done and unlike some, I really liked the ending and I will not forget the excitement of the series."
1306,Squid Game,"This show is the best show I have ever watched. I enjoyed it more than breaking bad, SOA, even game of thrones. Part of the reason why it is my favorite show was the AMAZING set design and art department. Each set looked like the spent millions and millions of dollars and it was so unique and absolutely amazing! Very gory and violent sometimes in a comical way. I love it. Can't recommend enough."
1307,Squid Game,"This series is a purely television masterpiece, as it presented us with a new and completely unrepetitive idea and this is what made us enjoy in every episode because we see things that we are not used to seeing much, in addition to that it discussed many important issues such as the accumulation of debts on humans, as well as equality between Individuals and other issues. And in the end I put it back again This work is a purely television masterpiece."
1308,Squid Game,"Do i really need to explain this? The VIPS are cringe in human form. But other than that, it might be one of the best shows ive ever watched."
1309,Squid Game,"Just finished watching this series and boy is it good. It always amazes me the ideas these people come out with for films and programmes and this is brilliant, the games are gruesome but well thought out, the dubbing has been done well and the tension it creates waiting for the next nightmare these contestants have to endure is great, all I can say is just watch it but keep the kids away."
1310,Squid Game,Go and watch this is surprise you with no doubt. Netflix top series I think. Best to watch. Acting is super excited. So watch this is super-duper. Peas in a few days ago and I don't know what I want to sell it for me to come over and over.
1311,Squid Game,"I'm not certain how this show got so much hype, maybe there's money involved? The plot is predictable and not a very good plot at that. The dubbing is out of sync, I found it all very painful. I revisited it twice but never got further than the first twenty minutes. I question the comment on Netflix ""'Squid Game' is Netflix's most-watched show ever"" with why? No stars and would give it a minus if I could."
1312,Squid Game,"..but entertained from the very beginning until end of season 1.Interesting story, great act (except of the crazy woman and the VIP's - really annoying)
However I've enjoyed each episode!"
1313,Squid Game,"It's dark. It's gruesome. It exposes the perverse and dysfunctional side of modern day humanity. And the English dubbing is awkward. But holy hell, this is one helluva original story that keeps you wondering, caring, uncomfortable and guessing - right up til the very end. Excellent acting by the main characters and creepy brilliant set design that will crawl under your skin. This makes Hunger Games look like a Saturday morning cartoon. It's a story that won't leave your psyche soon. Brilliant."
1314,Squid Game,"Great acting, heart and soul, lots of action and hard decision making. A tad slow at first, but after ep 2, I couldn't look away. At times I wanted to but I just couldn't. Definitely recommend."
1315,Squid Game,"I started watching this based on all hypes.Nothing came even close to creating a Hype.This is like some child show with very some brutal mentality expressed by creator.!And,
Editing, Direction is way below par...Guess worried about someone who loved this :)"
1316,Squid Game,"It's a survival webseries. It is gripping to watch. You cud predict some plots but still it is interesting and keep you hooked.Definitely worth a watch. Picturisation is good, direction too."
1317,Squid Game,"1. The Plot: We have seen it so many times. In ""Saw"", ""Hunger Games"", ""EscapeRoom"", ""13"" & etc.2. The Games: They are not thrilling or exciting, just a bunch of childish games. Even sometimes they get really boring, like the marble mission.3. Ending: Pure trash and total cliché. ""WE ARE RICH AND WE ENTERTAIN OURSELVES BY PLAYING CRUEL GAMES WITH PEOPLE"" !!! C'mon dudes! That same old crap again??? How many times we have to see this???Total disappointment."
1318,Squid Game,I'm so boreddddd. I'm on ep 3 or 4 and there's Only been one game what the heck? Lol. Hunger games was more riveting.
1319,Squid Game,"Damn it's so good. But it's not the best 😕
I loved 067 and her friend most
cuz they're cute 😍
and it contains a lot of violence so its not recommended for family."
1320,Squid Game,Acting is horrible and you can fast forward through half of it and still understand what's going on. Some of the games are interesting. Some take forever for no reason.
1321,Squid Game,"Squid game is a series full of symbolism. The crash of human value in exchange of money, indebted people who seek a refuge in fake hope.. It might even be one of the sharpest critiques to capitalism itself, where human exploitation is monetized and demoralized.Also, The contrast between the game world and the real world is devastating. People feel helpless in the real world and enter a deadly game only to feel even more abbandoned in the game world.Also, The VIPs -and funding sources of this surreal game- are American, does that tell you something?"
1322,Squid Game,"So a father is a waste of space gambling addict who let's his mother and his daughter down all the time, then he goes through the games and comes out on top.How does it end with him letting down his daughter again, what a complete idiot, he is about to board a plane to go see his daughter and he just turns around, letting her down yet again,Man starts off as bad father, meanwhile lots of people die then in the end he ends up being an even worse father.Still enjoyable as a series."
1323,Squid Game,And wasn't disappointed. It was actually good!!!! I wasn't going to watch it because everyone was making a big fuss about it. But I gave in and binge watch it! And it was really good! I'm surprised.
1324,Squid Game,I just came here to say that it worth every second.
1325,Squid Game,"As a huge fan of the death game genre, squid game is an amazing addition to that category.A lot of differing stories, unique and fleshed out personalities, a clever premise with great execution, relevant and thought-provoking themes/symbolism and amazing social commentary. I particularly enjoyed the critiques on capitalistic structures (on a global and national scale) and how it exists to benefit the rich while only giving the illusion of benefitting the working class as well as the different ways in which people deal with grief and how it was incorporated into the show made this it so engaging to watch. No character feels like a wasted spot and they all contribute to the plot. Their personalities clash yet they're able to work together harmoniously and develop strong bonds in a way that feels so organic and engaging to watch. Children's games being used as the basis of this violent, dystopian-like game invokes a sense of irony and adds another cruel layer to the games' unflinching brutality by invoking a sense of nostalgia. It's very haunting but quite captivating. The cinematography, script, and set pieces were great as well and added to the overall quality. There are a few things I would've liked resolved in the second half but as a whole, extremely enjoyable with solid writing and production. I'm very excited that season two was announced. Cause then they can reveal that Jun-ho actually survived :)"
1326,Squid Game,"Unreal, fanciful and really te waiting especially last 3 episodes.. 👎"
1327,Squid Game,"Children games were taken to next level. Emotions, actions, drama was properly managed and portrayed. It is full of twists and turns. The writer has truly written the story with efforts."
1328,Squid Game,I honestly don't get the hype it's not that good. I could barley finish the second episode. There are some parts that are good like the red light green light scene but other than that it sucked.
1329,Squid Game,"I mean..if you have nothing else to binge watch then sure..but I found myself fast forwarding the show because it was excruciatingly slow. Also, extremely predictable and no surprises anywhere...what's the hype all about?"
1330,Squid Game,Only reason it doesn't get a 10 is the V. I. P. Episodes. They were HORRIBLE!
1331,Squid Game,Honestly I'm good reviewer.. this series is great go and watch.
1332,Squid Game,"One of the most predictable shows ever. I'm aware this show tried to put dread over suspense but there's not much dread going in knowing exactly what happens. I already knew that Sang-woo was going to be the twist villain, and that the brother was the man in the black mask.Done to death but the VIP actors are laughably bad, so is the English dub AND sub.People seem to have a weird attraction for Korean stuff, and hopefully this show is a stepping stone for arthouse films to become more mainstream."
1333,Squid Game,"The writing, acting and almost everything else about it was so captivating and entertaining. I love the characters and the way that they make you feel so attached. Episode 6 is truly heartbreaking in terms of this aspect.The music was another thing I enjoyed. I can't quite put my finger on why the music was so perfect. It just... was.Although the acting of the white actors wasn't anywhere near as good the acting in the rest of the series, the rest of the show made up for itOverall a great show and I would recommend."
1334,Squid Game,"I liked the beginning of the series. It starts off strong and catches the attention of the audience from the 1st episode itself.It gets a bit boring in the middle, but picks up and the plot line continues to be interesting after that. I think 5th episode is a bit boring; other episodes are actually good and fast-paced.Its very good from the 6th episode till the start of the 9th episode. 9th episode is the final episode and I was expecting some big reveal and some interesting backstory as to why they were conducting the Game. But the reason behind the games is a bit disappointing and lacklustre with the reason being some rich people feeling bored and hence, conducting the Game. So finally, I felt like the series was not that great because of the simplistic ending."
1335,Squid Game,"Best Netflix show I've seen for awhile. Had echoes of Spanish film The Platform (2019) and of course The Hunger Games films.Hard on their luck people pushed down and controlled by the top feeders of society, are approached to play a game to win the big bucks and get out of the current holes they have found themselves in.And what a thrilling edge of your seat ride this makes for viewing. Unknown masked dictators are hosting a game-show of sorts were the players (In debt everyday people) are desperate to win the cash even if it costs them their lives.Lots of twists and some deeper observations on humanity follow. Just a warning it's very violent and a bit trippy, so if that's not your thang obvs avoid. It also reminded me of the human sport elements in Eli Roth's Hostel and James Wan's Saw franchise so yes it's out there.Will become a future cult classic and Korean cinema is having a golden moment after masterpieces like Parasite and The Handmaid. Squid Game's hyper realism is pretty visionary stuff for Netflix's typically bland output. Fly me to the moon 8/10."
1336,Squid Game,"The first 2 episodes are kinda boring but when they go back into the game it gets so much better. Not entirely sure about the ending, but maybe season 2 will reddem it."
1337,Squid Game,"An emotional rollercoaster that is guaranteed to keep you at the edge of seat. The characters are great and despite not lasting long, form an everlasting impression on the audience, the show also touches on the subject of human nature and all that. My personal favorite character is Sangwoo, his development was just (chef's kiss).There's also well planned foreshadowing leading upto the big plot twist at the end that may not be visible at first watch.Although 9 episodes wasn't enough for this show, a lot of things were left unanswered like the In-Ho storyline, where does the organisation go from here, who they really are and what direction Gi-Hun's character will take from here. All of which are hinting for an exciting sequel.Although I'm slightly worried that S2 might not live up to the hype since well, everybody Died and the show has to build an even stronger cast of characters from scratch. Will the showrunners be able to succeed? We'll see.For now let's just make Netflix to fix their awful subtitles, it makes the dialogue look bad."
1338,Squid Game,Sorry for all my troubles and thank you don't worry about your.
1339,Squid Game,"In the many number of TV series in game topic, Squid Game is worth watching and elaborate. There are a lot of fun and carefully prepared foreshadowing, however they're not new enough to attract my eyes. The bad VIP and leader to feign death are easy to recognize."
1340,Squid Game,"So first of all, we saw how much of a craze this show was from memes and our friends and we weren't going to sit down and watch it until it was killing us and we needed to know what the hype was all about. And to be honest, we weren't disappointed. This show was terrifying to think about because it would put you in a what if scenario and make you think ""What if this did happen?"" It also made the main characters seem like they were just regular people living life but at the same time, they were pawns in a sick twisted game. The acting in this one is spot on and we have to give major props to the actors. They were the ones that made this show so good. The story was actually pretty solid and the premise of it was pretty cool yet it seems like something that was done before. Still, the execution keeps you on the edge. It combines suspense, horror, thriller, and drama all into one. This show was something else!All the hype behind this one is no joke. It truly is a really good show and is something you should sit down and watch. But if you're not a big fan of blood, gore, violence, or anything involving people getting hurt or killed then you might want to take a pass on this one."
1341,Squid Game,"This is a fine tv show... I would say if you have nothing to watch then this will be a mildly entertaining tv show to look at, but don't expect much. This show is overrated, but not awful."
1342,Squid Game,"This is indeed a likely new TV classic - graphically, in terms of the screenplay and the sociophilosophical , characters, the screenplay. Red Light Green Light is already being memed through the roof, as is the cookie challenge. The ever so understandable challenge for people from poor background, and without choices - you'll agree. Time and time again, to dehumanising conditions and put all on one card, when you're without options. I also appreciated the richness of different arcs and how it linked with the main arc - the doctor among the contestants and his insider knowledge and the reason behind it - and how in the end it got resolved. I thought that the deep relationship that quickly developed between the two female characters was so endearing, and one hoped that somehow it'd be saved. Alas. The only thing that's certain in the game is death and loss. Oh how familiar. The ending left me quite confused, and I intend to rewatch the series once my memory of it fades a bit."
1343,Squid Game,"Wonderful serie great story, even thou it is a typical story about money. And how some will kill för it, thou others fight för life. Overall a really Good story, might say it is little like Battle Royale."
1344,Squid Game,"Just about to start ep. 2. Just wanted to say some might be turned off at first but hang in there til about 45min into first episode, then it gets really interesting. Don't know if anyone else said this cuz I didn't want any accidental spoilers so didn't check any reviews first. Peace and happy flickin'."
1345,Squid Game,"Squid game is a south Korean series that debuted to western audiences towards the end of 2021 and found massive success. The story follows our main character, a financially broken middle-aged man Seong Gi-hun. Through the fruit of his own actions, Seong is becoming more and more distant from his young daughter who he will forever lose contact with should he not get his life on track. The opportunity for him to become financially stable is presented to him in a colorful way, but will he take it? And what will the consequences be should he succeed?Squid game is a breath of fresh air to the horror / thriller genre, not that it necessarily did anything new but it managed to tell a consistent story with many impact-full and emotional moments through out, without having to solely rely on gore and violence to captivate audiences. The characters are all fleshed out and have a personality of their own and are acted out brilliantly. I cannot stress enough the importance of the acting in this series. Without being too negative towards the English dub of squid game, the preferred way to watch this series is certainly in Korean with English subtitles. Without understanding a single word of Korean I was able to fully grasp every emotion that the characters conveyed and feel that nothing was lost in translation. The story has many twists and turns but maintains an easy path for the audience to follow and never becomes ridiculous, insultingly obvious or wastes your time as the viewer.The series ends on a rather somber note and has left its self open for adaptation and continuation, which i heavily look forward to in the future and could see this series be pushed further into greatness.Squid game is a very easy watch with a great story and enjoyable cast of characters, with both sweet moments and horrifying ones. It does have 1 or 2 more than silly moments, but in the grand scheme of the series they work fine and not every throw of the dart is a bullseye. If you are a fan of films such a Saw but would enjoy seeing a slightly more dramatized version (and in Korean!) then this series is certainly for you. 8/10."
1346,Squid Game,"I would've given it a 10 because it was great. But the ending was terrible. I believe the writers had not a solid idea of how to end it. Or maybe because they want to do a second season they did that nonsense, mediocre end. The rest is great I was all the time excited of what was going to happen next but I think they should've left it at one season. Not try to milk it."
1347,Squid Game,"This show will keep you interested from start to finish. Very well written, set designs were incredible, and the ending was brilliant!Only negative I have from it is the same as a lot of other reviews. The VIP's were horrendous at acting!Power through those scenes because it's worth it."
1348,Squid Game,"Fun series, but lacks the psychological complexity and extreme levels of suspense we know from Kaiji. That said, Kaiji I was so intense I had to pop a couple Xanax while watching it to keep from having a panic attack.Squid Game isn't Kaiji, but the productions looks nice and it's entertaining enough. The narrative relies on well-established tropes, making the story highly predictable. You will probably guess the ""twist"" at the end very early on. So watch Squid Game if you are looking for an afternoon of light entertainment, just don't expect it to explore any uncharted territory.If you were hoping for something a bit more psychological, but without the unfettered intensity of Kaiji, then check out LIAR GAME. I like really enjoyed the 2014 Korean remake with Lee Sang-yoon."
1349,Squid Game,"Another death game concept series. This one more grounded in realism.Excellent portrayal of characters, considering most are all scumbags who got themselves deep in debt, like the MC. They are not presented as likeable characters, and make terrible decisions, and harm everyone around them with their actions, which is what led them here in the first place.The MC tries to redeem himself in the games but ultimately he fails to put himself together again after the traumatic experiences and lets himself go, like he did before the games. Instant money doesn't fix you, as a person.There are some issues in the show but overall I would say the good outweighs the bad in this TV series.Excellent pacing, good premise, and overall very solid.The VIP did have horrible acting but unfortunately typical for Asian shows...The ending, I can forgive, for being a second season grab and making less sense."
1350,Squid Game,"Squid Game is an asian series that got the hold of me immediately from the first episode. It is a serie that explores the lengths to which we humans are willing to go in order to both escape our misery but also to be entertained by the same misery... It is very tightly composed and we quickly understand why these miserable people are tempted to participate in the game. The makers really have invested in making the locations look stunning,and many of the scenes display mastery regarding design, decor and props etc.Following the game we get to know some of the characters on a deeper level, and it is heartbraking having to witness their fates as they are eliminated.Here we also are shown acts of selflessness and sacrifice,depicting the best of human nature.The only thing that I find negative is the language.The Korean language surely must be among the most annoying and disturbing ones to listen to...."
1351,Squid Game,"Squid Game. Wow.Korean.Best description? Uncomfortably genius!(Kind of disturbing - small warning but still)I mean there are some elements of The Game and Hunger Games, but this is bigger, more catastrophic in a different way, more clever, plays on psychological aspects, with a touch of closeness between some participants. Its intensely catchy and totally insane.Its set in a today's society with participants being people in economic trouble who owes a lot of money, mostly from gambling, and about their desperation. Great actors too!!They even include a very dark business of todays world - but I wont reveal anything here.Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion.If you're looking for something different that will get your HR rising, try this one! *Handclaps*"
1352,Squid Game,"I don't why people received it this well.It had overall great production design. But I really hate Korean style of ""acting"" which is just they whining over everything for the longest period slowing the whole pace. It usually annoys me rather than making me feel sorry. So, eh."
1353,Squid Game,"Engaging from start to end. Exciting, shocking, yet with a fresh and unique storyline that's delightful to watch and visually pleasing. Actors play amazing performances. I could compare to hunger games, but probably 10 times better."
1354,Squid Game,"This show is almost perfect! The visuals, the sounds, the acting are simply outstanding. The characters and storyline have depth and make you feel disgusted, intrigued, charmed, touched, sad, outraged but also contemplative.I think the ending could have been much stronger, but overall it's an almost perfect show that I would recommend to anyone."
1355,Squid Game,"Firstly, anyone reviewing this as 8 and higher needs to watch some proper cinema and recalibrate..I dont care that this is sadistic show on par with Saw series just with less gore..it is just the predictability, mediocre plot and the poor ending..he met 'the guy' at the end.. why is he saying that he wants to know who are they?And wait what he is coming back lolsuch a cheap ending."
1356,Squid Game,"I came into this with high hopes being a fan of Korean and Asian cinema and was not disappointed. I wouldn't honestly put this up there with Train To Busan - it had the same level of character development - you genuinely care what happens to these characters. It also has a battle royale meets would you rather meets hostel vibe. Just don't watch it dubbed, stick with the original Korean and subtitles."
1357,Squid Game,"Granted the first episode was well written and performed and SHOCKING!!! Whoo-hooo. But the rest of the show is very simple, predictable and frankly, boring. The hype is over hyped. The memes are just that and the internet bandwagon is full."
1358,Squid Game,"Started off great but lost it at the end. The last episode was so annoying. All the good he could have done after winning and all people he could have helped but instead he's just obsessed with who is behind the game. So he decides not to go and have a great life with his daughter, and it takes him a year to help two people, what a waste of time! Lots of inconsistencies too.A great idea that was poorly executed in the end. A Bittersweet Life is much better."
1359,Squid Game,"I heard nothing but hype around this tv show and had seen all the memes and had been told repeatedly to watch this show. What I got is a gory and bleak adult version of The Hunger Games. I connected with none of the characters, couldn't possibly root for any of them to win, each episode was dragged out for way too long and felt very over the top. I may have missed the hype or even felt the hype was heavily inappropriate considering the problems the characters are facing are happening to so many in the world that it feels wrong to celebrate a glorified gory version of it. If this blood spattering version of Hunger Games/Battle Royale is your cup of tea...have at it."
1360,Squid Game,"Serie could have been so much better with better actors. The main actors were very bad. I do understand a bad end of a movie, but this one beats all bad to endings. Very unlikely...."
1361,Squid Game,"Seriously, 10/10? A true thriller fan would find this painful to watch."
1362,Squid Game,I guess is due to culture differences but the cartoonish style and the hunger games like nonsense of the series gets into the way. It could have been much better with less gore.
1363,Squid Game,Nothing special at all!I don't even understand why it's so popular! Oh actually i do it's the power of the Internet!We have seen the idea that this work is based on over and over!And there is nothing special about this serie at all!
1364,Squid Game,"I don't get the hype at all! I stop watching after episode 3, it's to boring for me and the characters is the worst. The actors are far too exaggerated, to me the acting does not feel real. I do not know how they are in South Korea, so maybe it's typical of them? I do not know.The plot could be good, but it's to much predictable. And I really don't care what's happening to the characters. I really don't get the hype! What's so special about it?"
1365,Squid Game,"It's interesting, haunting, with great acting and set design. But the ending was disappointing, there are major plot holes, it was too predictable and rushed after the 7th episode."
1366,Squid Game,"While some scenes were hard to watch.. this movie is jaw dropping, start to finish. I almost always can't seem to get into foreign films but Squid Game had me by my lady balls! It's uncomfortable yet staggeringly exciting. I feel almost guilty for saying that but it's a twist that I have never seen done within a movie. Hunger game, maze runner, none of those can compare. I want MORE!!!!"
1367,Squid Game,"Like a blend of 'Running Man' and 'Lord of the Flies' (books, not movies) with a helping of 'The Long Walk' thrown in for good measure.The character development is excellent.I'm no movie critic, but this deserves praise."
1368,Squid Game,"How lame it is to copy the trade mark of one of the biggest tv shows. Even those who didn't watch la casa de papel, knows their red suit with the mask. And in 2021 to make a tv show copying the famous costum of an other show... even if it's an extremely well executed show, it is still really emberassing."
1369,Squid Game,"This series has everything and really captures what money does to people. It's shocking, moving and gripping all at the same time. Fantastic concept and all my grown up kids have watched it and we all loved it."
1370,Squid Game,"I really don't get why everybody's gushing over this piece of mediocrity. Honestly, it does not deserve the 8.6, and it does not deserve all the hype around it. There wasn't anything original or anything others hadn't done better before. I'd give it a 5/10, for being perfectly average if it stole only 2-3 hrs of my life rather than a whopping 9, but here we are. I kept watching in the hopes that something crazy was about to happen, right until the end, that justified all the craze, and was left disappointed when it finally ended. Give it a pass if you have anything slightly better than average to watch instead."
1371,Squid Game,"A very unique show that explores ideas about human morality in a truly wonderful way. The Korean actors are also excellent. Unfortunately it felt like the story started falling apart toward the ending. Many of the decisions made felt very anti-climactic and I was unsure what they exactly were trying to get across, especially in the last episode. The English speaking actors were also laughably bad.While this show in general is very well made, these flaws prevent me from giving this anything higher than a 7."
1372,Squid Game,"Keeping it short
Pros
1. Interesting initial episodes
2. Good cinematics (although some shots were too dark)Cons
1. Horrible soundtrack
2. Avg acting (in many cases overacting)
3. Multiple wasted side stories / appearances."
1373,Squid Game,"Bloody bt dramatic,
Good Korean series.Unexpected fin."
1374,Squid Game,"The series was definitely inspired by a bunch of films that came before it, but I'm not mad about tbh.I really enjoyed the whole idea of it and the social commentary it involves. That part definitely resonated with me.My biggest issue is that the series feeds into a bunch of problematic stereotypes and tropes that annoyed the heck out of me, so during the last couple of episodes I wasn't really invested in it anymore.There's good stuff in there but it's definitely flawed."
1375,Squid Game,"Seldom does one get so captivated by a story than this one. Most people binge watch it, unable to stop or wait for next episode. South Korea is producing films that the world wants, and does so with quality of production, captivating stories, excellent camera work, and skillful actors. Squid Games fills all of these categories. That South Korea films can appeal worldwide attests to the fact that they are eclipsing Hollywood, especially in drama where acting plays a larger role than bombast and action."
1376,Squid Game,"Why it is so special and Netflix #1? Don't get it. Of course the whole picture is colourful and looks good, but plot isn't unique at all. Of course it's about Korean children game, but I mean - playing for survive isn't new in the film industry."
1377,Squid Game,"The actual squid game was the least interesting of all the games played. The show started to become cliche and derivative of itself once the VIPs showed. Kinda like ""Hunger Games"", but without the fantasy elements and more misery. Started strong, but loses a lot of momentum near the last third of the show. While it wasn't a chore to finish the season, I wasn't too thrilled with each subsequent episode either. The revelations were either cliche or stupid. It was only the characters that saved the show for me. They were great till the end."
1378,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a bit overrated for me. But its entertaining from the first to the last episode. The storytelling is very good and the ideas of the games are very nice. I liked it.But in comparison to other series there is missing something. I dont regret watching it, but i dont follow the hype."
1379,Squid Game,"Not sure what all the hype was about. The most enjoyable thing about this show is watching all of the horribly unlikable characters get killed off. The only problem with this is that as more and more people got killed, it provided more screen time for the rest of the unlikable characters. The premise and story are ok, but the execution ruins it."
1380,Squid Game,I enjoyed it but its not sooo good as people are trying to portrait it. I still preferred Alice in Boderland but both series are good and enjoyable.
1381,Squid Game,It's a lame ending to a good show. Kind of ruins it.
1382,Squid Game,"Over the top acting, drawn out scenes and an awful ending. I watched the first two episodes and there was so much that could have been cut down. Ending up fast forwarding through the rest. Made sure to stop to watch all the contestants licking honeycomb for their life lol. Wouldn't recommend."
1383,Squid Game,Just an amazing show well written! Fantastic! Worth every second!
1384,Squid Game,I kind a like but it was sad and I don't really like the end...I don't really think I would watch season 2 and the main reason is death of Kang Sae bye and she was great character...
1385,Squid Game,"Not what I was expecting.The story for is a bit strange and not so clear in places.It's my first Korean series and movie, may be that's why I didn't catch everything.I'm giving 5 stars just because I like the way they shot it."
1386,Squid Game,"I have just finished it watching and I have no words to describe it. Trust me when I say this , It is probably the best thing I have ever seen. Story, acting , casting , production everything is very apt and top notch. I can't believe how perfect of a show is this. It is extreme in every human nature they portrayed like when they want to show you hate , friendship, trust , action, backstabbing every emotion is of very extreme kind. It also teaches us that money is not everything. Those who have money and those who don't are sad in one way or the other & We should help others no matter what. I will give it 10 out 10. All hail to Korea for this treat. Love from India 🇮🇳"
1387,Squid Game,Good series overall but the last episode made it a 6. The old was trying too hard to sound wise but didn't realize how much of a fool he was. Just because you're old doesn't mean you're right.
1388,Squid Game,"Having watched Alice in Borderlands last year which was amazing I was excited about all the buzz about this show. It's entertaining, but the acting is sometimes cringey and other elements drag on like episode 2 when they all go back and decide to return to the game which could've been done in a 15 minute segment. It's fine as a show and entertainment but a stand out show or original it's not. Definitely a case in which social media and buzz has outdone the product."
1389,Squid Game,"Loved this show. I watched it twice, second time with the parents who couldn't read the subtitles. I felt I was watching a different show second time around as the subtitles make it seem like bad acting. If you are going to watch this ( and I highly recommend) then please watch it in the language it is filmed in if possible."
1390,Squid Game,"There are some nice ideas here and there but mostly this poorly acted, boring clichéd series won't last the test of time for sure. It gets dragging on and on, towards the end I kept skipping most of the scenes. If it was dubbed in English, I'd watch it in the background while doing chores to avoid wasting 7 hours of my life."
1391,Squid Game,One of the best kdramas ever. I will défini rewatch t many times.
1392,Squid Game,"Taking childhood games and twisted them in a way that only a very sick mind would do,
So what if was done so perfectly, it steel not good,
And I'm not saying a words on what kids will say when they see it,
You can clap as much as you want, for me it is a big NO."
1393,Squid Game,Nothing else to say but wow. This show had me on edge of my seat for 9 hours. Like a cross of Hunger Games x The Purge and Would You Rather. If you like thriller/suspense this show is for you.
1394,Squid Game,The decision making of the characters is painfully bad and most of the acting is over done and cringey. There are also random side stories and characters that have absolutely no relevance to the show.
1395,Squid Game,"The Netflix subscription is $9 but the therapy you'll need after this show is priceless.To sum it up as briefly as possible, it's like a sundae made of scoops of Shawshank Redemption, The Purge, and the first Saw movie, with a little bit of Star Wars sprinkled on top."
1396,Squid Game,Without crossing that line of spoiler alert there is two glaring issues with this series but not enough to make this unenjoyable.I wish these issues where at the beginning not the end of the series but it was one hell of a watch. As I sat there it made me remember films like Old Boy... fight club and Charlie and the chocolate factory. Last 15 mins of episode 1 it really goes off. It was like of running man and battle royale had a baby.If your not hooked by end episode one then I wouldn't bother continuing but you will for sure. I voted 9 which was a little higher than I would have but people voting 5 is well out or order also so it is my way to balance it out as this has to be the best tv series I have watched this year.
1397,Squid Game,A good thriller at the beginning and dragged with lot of emotional drama towards the end. Acting and characters role played well. Overall a good series to watch but not as per expectations as per the hype.
1398,Squid Game,"Its about bunch of wealthy bored sadists betting on humans and killing the ones who lose.Story started of well with some goof ups and stupidity but it keeps you engaged.As you reach episode 6, it becomes quite evident who will survive and who won't. There is no explanation to what they do except for sadism and no value of human life."
1399,Squid Game,"I put off watching this show for a long time, trying not to buy into the hype. To this day, I still don't understand what all the hype was about. This show was just as boring as it was slow and predictable. It's like watching 'The Hunger Games' meets 'Battle Royale' (which has 100x better storyline & character development than this) meets 'Saw' with a light dusting of 'The Purge' and 'Liar Game'."
1400,Squid Game,"Very addictive. The most intense tug of war scene ever. This show will keep you curious, entertained and anxious the whole time. By the time the show is over you're left with a strange taste in ur mouth, mostly because the protagonist makes some very stupid choices that make no sense, this dude just keeps testing his luck assuming it will never run out. Anyways, this show runs back and forth from the depths of human depravity to the better angels of our nature. Definitely worth watching."
1401,Squid Game,The director must be fond of Stanley Kubrick. Everything from the music (same as used in 2000: A Space Odyssey) to the masks (reminds me of Eyes Wide Shut.
1402,Squid Game,"Hype is definitely justified! I loved the show, the actors, the music and the tension! I truly recommend it!"
1403,Squid Game,Let down by the ending. Final episode seems intent on wallowing in self pity. The main character comes across as weak and desperate to find someone to blame for his own actions. He was a loser at the start of the series and hasn't developed into anything better by the end. Made the whole series seem rather pointless.
1404,Squid Game,"A total disappointment, for starter..so much hype only to become famous for something been said older in the days..top knots b$$it if you want my honest opinion, lost almost a day watching the whole thing,no twist if you pay attention to the plot and not the perversion in multiple scenes."
1405,Squid Game,"The show is surprisingly good, but you need to watch it in Korean. The end is really bad, is a perfect show to discover Korean films/shows but the end is trash."
1406,Squid Game,Season 1 is great but the last scene was out of character I think. Not good. Why would the main character again ignore his daughter to go back to something he hated? To destroy it? I don't buy that.
1407,Squid Game,Unfortunately I came across this show because someone else in my house was watching.... dog's crap!
1408,Squid Game,"Sometimes we can predict who is behind the all games , also the old man is overactive."
1409,Squid Game,"Terrible acting, terrible execution, terrible translation and dubbing, emotionally disconnected from the scenes, BUT, great premise, writing and characters. Really enjoyed watching it. I'm sure Hollywood has noticed that this can be made into a monster! With Hollywood putting up a serious budget, quality writing, sets and cast, this can be made into a huge, multi movie franchise. I, for one, would be happy to see it."
1410,Squid Game,I ended binge watching this show. Edge of the seat series. Very layered.you will not be disappointed. One of the very best. Hope there is a season 2.
1411,Squid Game,This series is gold! A gripping drama that will want you you watching more!Hold tight past the first episode and it gets way better.A**************
1412,Squid Game,I really enjoyed this show and can't wait for a second season.I really liked the characters and became invested in them.A few things I didn't like was I wished they focused more on the games. A lot of the episodes focused on the characters.I also wish the main character put his daughter first. That was a bit annoying to see because I like his character.I still don't understand the point of the games and offering the money. I wish it had been explained better. Seemed like they tried to and I still don't get it.But other than those things it was enjoyable and very unique. I was on the edge of my seat so many times and I had to remind myself it's only tv.There are a few twists in it too if you like twists like I do.Highly recommend it.
1413,Squid Game,"To be fair, the games were exciting to watch and probably the best thing about the show. Everything else was rather dull. Most of the characters were lacking depth and having very cheap background stories. The whole concept of the games even happening with the players knowing what would happen eventually just seems so surreal and illogical it's been rather painful to watch if you care about comprehending character decision making at all.So stacking this up against other 8/10 shows on the site, e.g., Ozark, which is a show that is actually GOOD makes it seem like it should be rated waaaay lower. I'm assuming it's due to the hype and young audience rating it highly."
1414,Squid Game,"On the one hand, the first three episodes of this show amazed me and had me holding my breath. Excellent execution with developing all the characters and creating their backgrounds and motivations, overall plot is intense and interesting, has something to say. The show posed a lot of questions, a lot of mysteries, sadly the answers are why 3 stars got knocked out of my score. More specifically the lack of. The main questions that SHOULD be answered do get answered, but the many many subplots remain unsolved. For example the whole police character and doctor storyline, completely half-assed finish, unsatisfying. Also many many continuity issues. The whole everyone here is equal rule gets broken on the side of its creator every single episode, and there also a lot of shot-to-shot continuity issues which the editor didn't seem to catch, but they are noticeable (like the knife in ep8, a main factor and a huge story element whichh we're ment to keep the focus on but somehow it manages to do a cartwheel in Seong's pocket while being in the CENTER FRAME). The show IS great and definitely deserves a watch, I do still think however that they needed to map out the ending storylines slightly better for tall the secondary characters. I'm not going to waste time talking about the VIPs. Yes they suck and shouldn't be in the show, served almosy no purpose. I wish they were more influtual and coused a rift between the creators because they broke the eqality rule or something. They remain badly executed and any point to them was rendered unexistsant due to their unfinished storyline. Now they're just there to annoy watchers."
1415,Squid Game,It is a unique concept based series. Never seen such series ever before. Totally Mind-blowing. It is a masterpiece.Should watch it for sure.
1416,Squid Game,"A spectacular watch! Was on the edge of my seat the entire time, the show deals with human nature in a interesting, entertaining and most of all original way! Would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it thrilling the whole way through."
1417,Squid Game,Everthing is amazing i really like it so much i hope there is season 2.
1418,Squid Game,"Stop watching this filth. Like another reviewer said, this crap is conditioning society to accept this type of violence as an acceptable form of justice. IT IS NOT. This is the road to fascism and totalitarianism."
1419,Squid Game,"What a great series. How this got out on the back burning for so long astounds me. I'm so glad this finally got made and made it to our screens. Packed full of suspense, clever twists and edge of seat griping moments I highly recommend it.You get pulled into the actors characters from the get go and they all suit the part very well.I really hope they make a season 2."
1420,Squid Game,This Series shows the Real life financial crisis and debts and giving the worth through a game which is death or alive worth a watch.
1421,Squid Game,"Many reviewers have commented on the ""horrible acting"" of the VIPs. I sense their lack of emotion is intentional. It is indicative of their lack of normal human empathy.Overall I found the story to be interesting and that the story compelled me to continue watching through to the end. In that regard, the production was well done.The conclusion and theme is not anything that I can praise however. Life is not purposeless nor is everyone bad and lacking in virtue. I have viewed so many Asian films that purport to say ""life is futile"".Life is worth living. Life has meaning. That is my hope and faith. So I stand against the theme of the production but I found it interesting and entertaining. Entertainment is its only value."
1422,Squid Game,"I started it with no boogers but it turned out to be amazing show. If you like Alice in borderland, you will like this for sure."
1423,Squid Game,"Boring, predictable, sometimes ridiculous....
Managed to watched it all though, but still....
There are much better Series out there!Skip that one."
1424,Squid Game,"I read a lot of reviews saying it's a stolen concept, and maybe that's true, but let's face it - it's hard to be original these days. I personally think it's more about the way the concept is elaborated and I can only say that they did one hell of a job with Squid Game. I'm not one to follow the big hype train, but after everything I heard about it, even I was curious and they simply didn't disappoint me, and I'm actually quite the critical. You do need to look a bit further to enjoy it to the fullest, though. There's a whole story hidden underneath the simple concept of rich people letting poor people play games and therefore with their lives. It's all about the psychological effect, it's all one big experiment and that's exactly what makes it such a great show. The great acting is nothing more than the so-called icing on the cake.All things considered - I truly loved the show and I think it's definitely worth your time."
1425,Squid Game,"Its really amazing drama/thriller serie. At the start,u just think its gonna be easy game and the people gonna have fun together,earn money together. But the thriller starts here and u just realised a lot of weird things. I dont like the end,its should be 1 season serie but I think producter wants another season too..we will wait and see,great serie. Greetings."
1426,Squid Game,"Really great show. Story driven and well acted. The VIPs are the reason for loss of a star, horrible acting by them. Otherwise, give in to the hype, I watched the whole thing in a weekend."
1427,Squid Game,"One of mind blowing web series available on Netflix. Just unpredictable , loved it."
1428,Squid Game,"This is one of my best short series of all time, it is so attaching and make you wanna finish it in one day, yes it is so violent and scenes might really disturb you, but.... I love it."
1429,Squid Game,"Love each episode and the stories and performance of the acter and actresses. The show is a projection of life's absurdity, ambiguity, and desire. In general, It is a reference to humanity and our daily life. I highly recommend movie lovers to binge watch it with their loved ones. My husband had a doubt about the show when i first asked him to watch, and gladly the show proved me right. It was a splendid watch! It made me promise myself to watch more Korean movies. 😅"
1430,Squid Game,"Its an amazing series I just hate that the guy never takes care of his daughter 😭😭😭 and please we don't need a season 2, it'll ruin the series 👺👺👺 the cast was sooo good, I really felt angry about you know who."
1431,Squid Game,"After watching Attack on Titan I felt empty, I couldn't watch netflix anymore.But this one guys, I don't know what to say. A cult! One of the best and emotional shows ever produced! Episode 6 represents TV at its peak."
1432,Squid Game,"Squid Game perfectly illustrates the animalistic nature of human desperation. Each game presents its contestants with a challenge makes them question their morals for the sake of their own survival. Had me at the edge of my seat the entire time, would love for the series to receive a season 2."
1433,Squid Game,Very good story and acting. The VIP's were a bit excess tho.
1434,Squid Game,"This series really exceeded my expectations! It's almost close to perfection actually. The rules and regulations of the game isn't that unfair. Moreover, it's the most considerate survival game challenge i've ever seen. Given the fact that they themselves are the one who made the decision to participate.I can see in this series the combination of gantz, saw, the purge, money heist and alice in borderland. If i were to compare this to Alice in Borderland, i definitely would say this is better. Maybe because of the pandemic when it was release and made but nevertheless, i must say that the Squid Game has a very unique content.Games are not too complicated and not that easy but they needs some improvements. Games actually went well because of the certain roles of the players and great portrayals!And lastly im very fond of the thrills the series brings in every episode that makes you end up rushing to see the next scenarios in the next episodez."
1435,Squid Game,Nothing crazy the ending was pretty alright. I enjoyed it but people are going way too crazy over it. Most characters I just didn't really connect with and a lot of things were very predictable.
1436,Squid Game,"Enjoyed a lot of it but..
It was predictable for the most part which is fine in most cases but I think a better plot twist at the end could've improved it. Also the Vip thing was weird and disappointing, the acting on them was... Pretty self explanatory.... Most characters were written quite well which I liked."
1437,Squid Game,"This series is so similar to Alice in Boarderland, except only that the crew added flamboyant sets and symbols to make it pretentious. At first I was at least amazed by the idea ""game of killing in another world"", but after comparing it to Alice, which was shot before Squid Game, I can not give it any kudos. Squid Game speeded up the whole scenario to be eye-catching, but that left the characters shallow and predictable. And the story used too much technique. For example, they didn't elaborate on the deep emotions between players (like the couple), in which case they would make irrational decisions. They only depicted the connection of some new friends, who would not have the strong emotion as close ones. Focusing on the dark side looks cool, but that's not gonna make it a classic. It's like a dish with too much MSG."
1438,Squid Game,"Definitely predictable and not original. Plus too much exposition.By unoriginal, I mean that this kind of story already exists, but I get the hype since it's a visually attractive adaptation of a pre-existing plot.Anyone thinking this is fresh needs to watch more movies. And ""the similarities stopped at the first game"" my a**. The glass bridge is just a lesser Sky-High Hopscotch.It could have been just one season, since whatever the old man's motive is, it ain't that interesting.7 = good."
1439,Squid Game,"I would recommend you guys to watch the series although there are some problems.The first six episodes were really good and I was also amazed by the series, but starting from the 7 episode the series goes downhill too deep.Although some might feel it's a cliffhanger ending its really not the old man being the host was kind of predictable and totally did not shock me.And about the guy not entering the plane doesn't make sense to me at all."
1440,Squid Game,"It was a very good series, I really enjoyed it! I do like this type of genre so I was looking forward to watch it! I think that the plot was entertaining and I also think that the series took inspiration from different popular series such as Money Heist (the guys wearing red suits) or Star Wars (the guy wearing the black mask looked like Darth Vader) or even the typical play station logo with all the basic geometric shape, which I didn't mind. I also noticed that the series is pretty similar to Hunger Games and Alice in Borderland on different aspects but I still find it unique and interesting. I didn't mind the VIP acting tbh, I've seen worse and that was ok. However there is one thing that I would have changed. I would have made the evil guys on red suits more stronger and I guess more 'bossy'. Idk but I felt like on a few scenes the red suits guys weren't really that strong and able to manage the participant properly. I remember one scene where a red guy had to take off his mask in order to handle the situation with a participant (knowing that doing so, he might die!?) Are these red suits guys been trained well enough for their job or not? It just felt that they were weaker than the participants, if it weren't for the guns these red guys would have lost immediately. That's my opinion tho, It's not that big of a deal. The rest was good!Again I liked the plot, I liked the characters and the writing was good. Yes there are things that I didn't quite understand such as why did the brother killed his brother?? Just like that?? What was the purpose of the police guy if then he ended up like that? And there is moreHowever I did enjoy the series and I can't wait for the next season."
1441,Squid Game,"First of all, I'll talk about what I like! The concept is great, it drags you in and makes you want to binge the show right until the end, the art direction is also fantastic, taking what is essentially a very dark subject matter and giving it a child like aesthetic is very jarring but in an enjoyable way.Characterisation has its ups and downs, the main protagonist is initially presented as a dead beat who steals from his own mother to gamble, but through small actions you get the full picture that while he's a bit of a waster, he has a heart of gold.Other characters not so much, there's an edgy North Korean female character who's lines made me genuinely cringe. ""I don't trust people"" is one of the lines that stuck out for me, I dislike when a character has to state one of her character traits to let the audience know it is in fact one of her character traits.The dubbing is also awful, I don't know who was in charge of it, whether is was Netflix themselves or a 3rd party but it's woeful, like really bad.I'd still recommend the show though, it's an enjoyable watch regardless of its flaws. 7/10."
1442,Squid Game,"In fact, I don't understand why there is so much hype about him, this is just a Korean series on netflix, and it has become most popular because of all sorts of parodies of it, and fashion games based on them (Roblox, Minecraft, etc.) and lately everything has become popular because of Korea as the same BTS (which I hate khem) but the series itself did not hook, watched one episode and forgot."
1443,Squid Game,"Many people talk highly of this show, so I had high expectation. It was good but some things made me disappointed. SPOILER ALERT. Too much plot armour for the police. How did he manage to infiltrate the place with so much security? And how lucky he is to be one of the recruit traitor and get the square mask? The Front Man said the biggest value of this game is equality, yet some participants manage to bring in some tools, and peek their game preparation. Ali lost because he got cheated, not through a legit game. So much for equality bruh. Sometimes the recruit is like not exist at all, they supposed to make sure all the participants play fairly. The last game was the most boring game. It's just like watching teenagers fighting pathetically. And the biggest thing that ruined the show is the ending. Gi-Hun suddenly become a high morale person, trying to catch the game organizer that he abandon his daughter! He was introduced as non responsible person, doesn't work hard, and love gambling, why he suddenly need to be so heroic??? He even cheated with the old man."
1444,Squid Game,"I'm not quite sure why it's as great as it is , but I watched it all in two days. I couldn't get enough. It was so different and you get so involved with the characters. Very well done."
1445,Squid Game,"Well, it´s not the type of series that I used to watch but This was good."
1446,Squid Game,"Ep.2 & 6 are easily the top tier episodes. They built tension and characters right. It's a great story. Easily ""A"" tier series until..... The ending.YES, Great story telling, the tension and flow and ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TO STICK THE LANDING RIGHT and it FAILED. Resulting into a dragging episode and an 8 episodes wasted. I also have to mention ep.4 "" Rumble at night/ lights turn flashing"" scene, it's a bad idea filming against the light or in a dark area, let alone filming with flashy lights (hahahah). It's an unspoken rule but important, I nearly puke and I didn't know what is going on at that scene. That scene is bad but not as TRASH as the ending. Still, I enjoy the series but the ending makes me feel I wasted a cry at episode 6. And BTW, VIP's = CRINGE."
1447,Squid Game,"I enjoyed the suspenseful ride and twisted concept of the series! Actor HoYeon Jung stood out most to me; especially after finding out it was her acting debut. Death scenes in this show comes by form of execution, which was almost too much to watch at times. Show lacks no detail within the games facility and does a great job of forming bonds and friendships in such a doer situation! Only thing I wish for was a ending that brings actor Lee Jung-jae closer to his family (daughter) at the end.... More than just a phone call was needed after leaving her standing in the rain like that 😠. Overall great show, great acting, great concept, season 2 worthy Netflix!"
1448,Squid Game,"This is an good tv show but very melodramatic for no reason! It has the emotion so wrongly translated
Good show to watch but once you watch Alice in borderland this seems so predictable."
1449,Squid Game,Entertaining moments captured with life lessons but the ending sought to discredit the whole point of the series. It is apparent that Season two is in the works so waiting to see what the writers come up with.
1450,Squid Game,This TV series was a great binge on a world that could possibly exist. Underground better people bet on more than chicken fights. Its hard at times with the english translation and the lips not matching the words but overall a great fresh take on a underground better world that may or may not exist.
1451,Squid Game,"Squid Game (2021)
Created by Hwang Dong-hyuk""The truth is always more heroic than the hype.""
Jessica LynchPandora boxes come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. Amongst them, Hype trains are one of the colossal, if not the most colossal forms prevailing around right now. There are hardly any aspects that can escape the tout blanket devised by the internet community. But, take nothing away, 'Squid Game' definitely stands out to be one of the most intricately enticing shows ever set in motion.Converging a stiffly contrasting set of genres into one, 'Squid Game' furnished a fantastic surge-filled intrigue to the global audience throughout its limited run spanning just 9 episodes. One of the most striking ingredients is that the makers managed to deliver a sucker punch, should I call it rather a KO blow for the kinda impact it had. Many biggies failed in doing so in the past despite having a sizeable script and having moderate longevity.Putting forth the spotlight on the suffering and deprived class of South Korea, the show trudges on forward with copious amounts of twists and turns by pushing the 456 participants to the absolute limits of humanity and make them question the moral code more often than not. With absurdity and surrealism in substantial portions, it gave the writing a license to thrill. 'Terrific' would be an understatement as long as 'making the audience bite their nails on the edge-of-their-seats' feeling is concerned.There is scarcely any room untaken to point fingers at the acting in 'Squid Game' as every single actor on the screen has beautifully engineered and pulled off spellbinding performances; no doubt about that. In a world where the Korean culture is ravaging up the Earth through the music industry, 'Squid Game' has just become the cherry on top of the exponentially growing Korean domination.The reason I believe why 'Squid Game' rose to fame in such a quick period is its atypical unconventionality in making. For the generation that's been built on fantasy, action, adventure, 'Squid Game' came in as a captivating breath of fresh air."
1452,Squid Game,"The film alternates between moments of sunspance and boring moments, some really too slow scenes and unexplained question marks, it's pretty as a series but I don't understand all this success it's having where it comes from. The final part is a little too forced."
1453,Squid Game,"If you're looking for a show in which people play a game that involves squid, you will be disappointed. The title is because basically the game's playing field was shaped like a squid when the creators were kids or something, but the show doesn't have a single squid. So 1 star because it's called Squid game but has no squid, which is disappointing to say the least."
1454,Squid Game,"The atmosphere, plot, acting is very good and enjoyed a lot. Still, the American actors were so weird and felt like if the staff and director asked strangers in Korea if they could speak fluent English so they could act in the movie because it was really weird acting and the 69 jokes were really stupid, killed the vibe. Also, the unnecessary sex scene as in any other Netflix production felt really necessary to the plot.I guess that's Netflix or American culture to add sex scenes in any type of film & movie?"
1455,Squid Game,"Creat cinematography. Excellent story line. Great acting!Very interesting take on showing human nature and how twisted it is.At first, I wasn't interested in watching it but after the first episode I was hooked. Amazed after every episode with how intricate this is entire concept is.This series is full of big and small details which could be missed if not paying attention."
1456,Squid Game,"The show got popular thanks to the strength of the first few episodes but the story, acting and plot all take a nosedive as the series progresses.The show is excessively gory to fill in for it's lack of actual substance and there isn't a satisfying ending for any of the characters.Very average show but that's generally what you can expect from gore porn television/movies/etc."
1457,Squid Game,"Being child and have yard games... is fun and pleasure. According to positive votes I assume nowadays people need more bloody spectacles and pain. I find it far from interest this sick fantasies of the author, cast and director. For simple loose in child game... is death according to this poor series.I get no pleasant feeling from this movie, just a Vomit.Not worth to watch at all. Keep it away from children."
1458,Squid Game,"Good basic idea...
Being a big fan of battle royal, I was immediately attracted by the pitch of the series. But in the end, the series turned out to be a little too predictable in my opinion. It's not bad but I expected better.I also expected more ""gore"" scenes. So... Not bad, but I expected much better.It must be said that for me Battle Royal is almost ""unbeatable"" in the genre :)"
1459,Squid Game,I'm watching this on Netflix and with the dubbing it's like watching an anime.
1460,Squid Game,"I love this show, it had me hooked from the very first episode."
1461,Squid Game,"Just awful. How on Earth can anyone rate this as even close to Westworld. If Squid game is a 9 then. Westworld is a 90! This is the Kings suit of clothing. I loved Parasite, it was utterly brilliant. This is embarrassing and very poor. The acting, the script, the subtitles are all of a student making their first feature. Netflix launched with Game of Cards and have followed up with countless classics (Dark is a breathtaking series), Sex Education is so entertaining. And the list goes on until we hit the buffers with Squid Game. I hate to be negative as 99% of my reviews on here are extremely positive. There is plenty more fish on Netflix leave this little sea creature in the depths of dystopian bilge."
1462,Squid Game,I started it and thinking this is going to be a B-tvseries but it's AMAZING! When I think I know what's going to happen they throw a curveball.What an amazing tvserie.
1463,Squid Game,"Serial is innovative and exciting..
But there are too much badly done things, misses...and of course it's not realistic and I'm not talking about the main theme!I think that the place where people killed each other for money can exist, but the way that these people play and act its not the best I've ever seen on the screen, believe me.If you are asking yourself whether watch or not - better watch, but for the idea, watch to think later of some things..don't try to find the weakest moments, so you can enjoy full-time!"
1464,Squid Game,"It's a really great movie - the scenario, the characters, actors performances, music, sound, art and spaces, editing (oh, I love the moment when everyone gets in the wagon at the end of the 1st episode, it's spot on!), camera work, direction, logic everywhere and in everything, the start and the end. I watched the whole thing in one day and couldn't stop. But give this movie 18+ rating and add horror genre in the description, so children don't watch it. Because it's a real nightmare and because of such movies they go and kill each other in schools and on the streets (mass shootings)."
1465,Squid Game,"This show brings ideas previously reserved for the freewheeling realm of animation to the sh**eating culture of 'throwing what you got at the wall given the right testing metrics' that is streaming platforms. A wonderfully performed and dynamically directed ensemble that couldn't have cost half a fast and furious, watch this show if you have any time at all and remember that you as a member of the 1st world are the villain of this existential cacophony."
1466,Squid Game,Korea is turning to one best movie makers . What a fascinating serie.
1467,Squid Game,"Sorry to all the fan boys out there.But Squid Game isn't that good.And it is no where near 10 star good as 24% of all users reviewed it to be.The ""play a game / complete a course or die""- plot isn't new or innovative. The acting is exaggerated (like the villains from the pokemon cartoon) and the final game/ending/winner is no surprise to anyone. The show has some good moments (most of them in the GGanbu episode), and you easily watch every episode in one go, in a eager to find out who will be eliminated in what order.The best acting perfomances goes to Jung Hoyeon and Lee Yoo-Mi through out their short apperances in the show, but especially in the GGanbu episode.The good perfomance is though quickly forgotton with the performances of the ""rich white men"" whose acting must be the worst through out the show - perhaps through out Netflix.So - decent, but no where near other shows with this rating.Love the track suits!Btw. How do they fit that many people in that tiny boat; how does the job application looks for this game; whats up with the organ harvest side story; they obviously want to keep the island/game a secret, but yet they send everybody home to tell the world about it."
1468,Squid Game,"Pretty well done, This series is heavily inspired by the anime Kaiji.If you like this series, you should give it a try the anime version, which is kinda old but good!Story is great, actors are average but story covers for them!"
1469,Squid Game,"Squid Game was very predictable, specially Player number 1...This theme is nothing new. I didn't find anything to be super hyped...."
1470,Squid Game,"Was a good watch the first 3 episodes. Then I got bored and then it picked up again only to be ruined by the finale. I hated the ending. Gi-hun went back to being a loser and just forgot about his daughter for a year? I get guilt but damn I was hoping he would've at least changed his life. The old man was behind everything..okay but i didn't really care for this reveal. It didn't do anything. I wish we learned more about the Frontman and his brother. He just shoots him and that's the end of it. All in all, it was just alright. Episodes were too long and dragged out."
1471,Squid Game,"Poor dialogues, laughably loud melodramatic acting, predictable plot full of plot holes. Another overmarketed overhyped series by Netflix. The ending is laughably bad."
1472,Squid Game,"In general I liked the show. It kept my interest but if we remove all of the unnecessary, pointless and boring conversations that bring no value to the whole picture we would end up with a good 2 hour movie 😃"
1473,Squid Game,"I reluctantly watched the first episode of Squid Game, since Netflix products almost always disappointed me, and I must admit that what glued me to this unusual series initially were just the sophisticated choice of the Escher-like scenography and the trumpet concert by Haydn. Going on, however, I enjoyed a lot the inspired director's visionary touch, the non-trivial sociological inputs, and the appreciated revisitations of some iconic scenes from Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces. While I agree that the finale is just an add-on and a justification for a second series, quite weak actually, I like to imagine that the true meaning of the ""haircut scene"" was no more than the demarcation and the underlining of the desired original director's cut itself. A good product, finally."
1474,Squid Game,"Mind blowing, you just can't take your eyes away from the TV for anything.Loved it and looking forward for season 2, hope it will continue at the same level."
1475,Squid Game,"Again the masses of idiots populating the planet these days have spoken.This is series is boring, and not even in English. It's dubbed which makes the acting even more laughable.Plot holes galore in this comedy.And the most pointless 11 minutes of my life."
1476,Squid Game,"Loved the series, so many good things coming out from Korea lately. Really loved the first six episodes which were fantastic. However last three episodes and as many others have mentioned the VIPs were terrible.I never understood if the cop died, because he was only shot in the shoulder?Also, why wouldn't he use the money in the end hahaha, didn't he have loan sharks after him??I like the fact though that it didn't get a Hollywood ending. All in all, well done Korean television! Keep it up and we can get rid of the shifty Hollywood crappy American stuff once and for all."
1477,Squid Game,"Great story, great pacing and visually, it packs a punch! It is similar to Battle Royale however, it delves deeper and provides great character development and a real feast for the eyes in terms of the colourful sets and and costumes. It's raises many questions around humanity and how far you would go to help others or save yourself.It's a wild ride from the moment it begins and the relatable characters really draw you in. There have been a lot of comments about the VIPs - just ignore those! The version of the film I watched is dubbed so maybe there's a reason for the slightly off-pace intonations; but that doesn't take away from the performances.It's certainly binge worthy and if you can handle the odd violent scene, then go for it!"
1478,Squid Game,How on earth this web series is good. No logic very poorly directed. Over hyped series. Better skip.
1479,Squid Game,"From the very first episode, it was obvious the series would be great. Nicely paced, full of suspense and drama and great acting.The last episode was however a bit anti-climatic. The conclusion went against the most important thing the protagonist had been fighting for the entire series.A great series in all and a worthy watch."
1480,Squid Game,"I liked the show. It's addictive, well paced and some of the contestants really acted well.A lot of reviewers judge the acting of the VIPs. I would say, it is not bad acting but rather they show how pathetically boring and disgusting people can be, visualizing that just having lots of money makes you no one special.And the end is pretty logical to me. It doesn't require money to be a good parent. If he gambles 20 dollars away which were given to him for his daughter's birthday, why should he act differently when having millions on his bank account? Love is something money can't make a difference on. A true loving father would never be in this game, but rather be motivated just by the presence of his daughter to make his life right and be there for her as a father and not with presents."
1481,Squid Game,The worst tv show I ever watched in my life it's totally waste of time.
1482,Squid Game,I would have given 10 but I thought series lost his pace in last episode.barring last episode it was all fast paced ..overall really enjoyed watching it.
1483,Squid Game,"Watched due to all the hype but the storyline is bad and predictable, the acting is horrible and very exaggerated, there are no likable characters, the dialog is idiotic, and the series is violent for the sake of violence. Worst series we've seen in awhile."
1484,Squid Game,Nice to see something left field and not normal mainstream. The voice overs weren't great. I hope a western company can buy the rights and re-make a new version......
1485,Squid Game,"It is the first Korean TV series I watched. I found it very interesting, with fast action. It also gives you food for thought. Unlike series of similar cases, it has the main difference that the players are there voluntarily. This creates different dynamics and plot. Watching the first 6 episodes I was excited. From the 7th episode until the end, there was no surprise and everything was predictable.The explanation of why all this happened,was just what was expected. The story with the policeman and his brother, did not finally seem to have special meaning. The ""plot twist"" with the old man, was not a plot twist at all, if you have watched ""Saw' 1 & 2 and many of the thrillers that followed it. Perfect up to a point, but without a climax. This could have been a 10 but.."
1486,Squid Game,"Have so far forced myself to watch three episodes. The plot is o.k. Don't even mind the violence but the acting is really, really bad. Worst I've ever seen in a movie.Everyone seems to love it, can't figure out why."
1487,Squid Game,"You don't have to be a Korean drama fanatic to enjoy Squid game, it is great, the VIP team is lacking but otherwise everything else is just perfect............okay this isn't actually happening somewhere right 😂😂😂😂😂😂, with the desperation for money currently in the world I wouldn't be surprised🤦"
1488,Squid Game,"I watched the first three episodes, but had to fast forward a lot to not go crazy with boredom... YouTubed a summary instead, then watched only the last episode. Way too slow imo, very predictable at times, should have been a 2 hour movie. Luckily there are some surprises, and I like the consept itself 🙃"
1489,Squid Game,"I watched the first three episodes, but had to fast forward a lot to not go crazy with boredom... YouTubed a summary instead, then watched only the last episode. The story went was way too slow imo, very predictable at times, should have been a 2 hour movie... Luckily there are some surprises, and I like the consept itself 🙃"
1490,Squid Game,"First five episodes are incredible.You get a mysterious setting with characters to which anyone can relate to, even if you are not a few million in debt.After the first five episodes however, things begin to crumble.You start getting fed information about the whole mystery which ruins the viewer's expectations as things like this are best left unknown.The whole plot line of the side cop Cho Sang-Woo who is looking for his brother and is trying to bring the games down is absolutely pointless, he accomplished nothing, only to find out that his own brother is pulling the strings.He dodges compromised guards, disgusting forced gay interactions and runs like a wild animal, outswimming a gps tracker underwater. One would think that they would at least see him passing them on the gps tracker.The old man Il-Nam who's ganbu tries to trick him in order to live, comes back from the dead, only to reveal nothing. His whole buildup and emotion during that episode where he initially dies is absolutely destroyed by having him be a plot twist VIP at the end.The rewatchability continues to crumble with each plot point.The games go from actual logic and quick thinking to absolute chance and stupidity. An entire character, Kang Sae-byeok dies from a level getting self destroyed? Like why? Why do you kill off a character in such a meaningless way. Yes Sang-Woo finishes her off, but brings absolutely nothing to the show. She would have had 5 minutes tops from the incredible blood loss due to a huge glass shard ending her.Yes the American VIPS are trash and the dialogue sucks, but they are not the worst part.The last final epic game that kids play in teams is decided to be a 1v1 as it's the show's epic name. SQUID GAME.The most boring ending game to have a 1v1 with. Would be a hundred times more entertaining if they added more people to it, as it's meant to be played.And to top it all off after our main protagonist gets out of there he is so shocked that he is late to treat his mother and she dies, that he absolutely forgets about his daughter, his friend's mother who somehow did not get her shop taken, as it was mentioned that his friend bet his mother's shop and the young girl Kang's little brother.It takes him a year to actually act and do something, because the old man reaches out to him and meets him one last time.And instead of meeting his daughter to be a good father for once in his life, like he earlier mentions a few times, he decides to be the big strong man and take the games down which had him mentally broken for a year.I understand that he did not want to spend the money, but at least take care of your friend's mom and a little boy. He could have even given a hand to Ali's family after he saved his life.When you get such an incredible start and so much potential in the beginning, it's not easy to keep up the quality. The actors played absolutely fantastic ,but the writers just did not handle those episodes well enough which pretty much ruins the buildup of the previous episodes."
1491,Squid Game,"I have finished to watch this Korean Drama, it is very good, will this renews Season 2?"
1492,Squid Game,"For the last +2 years I've been getting into the Korean productions. It's a severely under apriciated market with good scripts, acting and cinematography. Sadly my fellow westerners are hesitant to subtitles but luckily some great series like this one get picked up in the mainstream giving them the recognition deserved.This is as such, and the hype is deserved.Yes the VIP come across as ruining it but I hate to say it, our western loud entitled abrasive personalities is what they are perpetuating and I find the annoyingness of watching the VIP reflects how rude we come across in other cultures and is actually warranted.My only complaint with the series is the ending, I get it but slightly drawn out and clearly just to set up a second season. Otherwise we'll worth the watch."
1493,Squid Game,"I continue to be impressed by Korean shows and movies. I really love them. This is a great show that I hope will go on. The characters are excellent, the games are anxiety-inducing and scary, and will have you dying to see what's next, and actual character development takes place throughout. I felt so many emotions watching this; I was moved. One of the biggest highlights for me was the relationship between Gi-hun and Sang-woo. The tension was built up over time and subtlety at first, and the story as a whole was done nicely. I also really liked the undercover cop/brother of the Frontman, and was heartbroken when his story ended the way it did. Everything he did was to find his brother, and what happened to him really made you disgusted with the Frontman and the whole organization.I thought the Tug-of-War challenge was the most disturbing one. To think about how it would feel standing at one side of the rope knowing you have to yank a group of people to their death so it's not done to you makes me wince.If I had to add some critique, I would agree with other reviews about the VIPs. Their acting was horrible and did not fit in with the rest of the show. But they just weren't a big enough element to really affect my rating."
1494,Squid Game,"A very disturbing series to watch, however, once you start it you cannot put it of your mind until you finish all 9 episodes. The idea is new and crazy and fun to watch. But it feels unreal. You don't want this to EVER happen to ANYOME at ANYTIME!A shoutout to the soundtracks!"
1495,Squid Game,"It's not even THAT original and even though it was interesting to watch I truly don't get the hype this show got over night. I'd recommend it if someone really enjoys the mystical drama thrikler with a lot of violemce type of show/movie, but if not, there really is no reason to watch the show. Characters aren't likeable and like I said even though it seems original at first, there's a lot of elements taken from other movies/shows (Saw, money heist)"
1496,Squid Game,"Wow, this got off to such a great start and sustained it for 6 episodes. I liked it so much that I binge watched it. Then in episode 7 it did a face plant!! As many reviewers mention: the VIPs are unbearably ridiculous and painful to watch. But in addition to that, in my opinion, the ending is ridiculous!! Such a let down to what was a glorious series. Sorry I wasted any time at all on it!"
1497,Squid Game,I've never watched a Korean tv show before but decided to give this a try since it looked very intriguing and it definitely did not disappoint! It's got an interesting story plus some crazy and gory themes. I highly enjoyed it from start to finish!
1498,Squid Game,"Originally I was going to give this an 8/10, but then I got to the part where they introduced the VIP's and started to see the problems. Who wrote the script for these ""VIP's""? They basically made them seem like Old Rich white dudes who didn't have a brain and never had a conversation before. Every time the VIP's talked, I wanted to punch them. That is NOT what English speaking people sound like.Everyone is treated equally in the squid games, but as soon as the lights go out, it's no longer fair. They literally let that psychopath and his goonies murder 27 people in like a 10 minute span. How is that fair?I will give credit though to The show, it did have some originality to it. Hard to be original is an era where everything has been done before. Just a little too graphic/gory for a TV show."
1499,Squid Game,Aside from Narcos and Sopranos this has to be one of the best series ever made. It sucks you in from the very first episode and it drags you in front of the TV to binge watch the entire series all in one day. The acting is incredible. The storyline is suspenseful. The production is magnificent. Overall thank God it took some Asians to make a really good series because Hollywood became all trash.
1500,Squid Game,I feel like I hace seen this before a lot of times. It just feels like hunger games feel wise(Just the context not the spesific things) But in general executed above avarage.
1501,Squid Game,"If you're not used to this Survival Game genre, you might find it exciting. As a long fan of this genre, I can make sure that this series is undoubtedly one of the worst among all. The problems lie severely in 2 key points that make a good Survival Game Film: The games and The story-telling. While the games, without exaggeration, are horribly boring, forcing, and lack the creativity to the point I don't even know if they actually spend time thinking about the game or they just pick it up randomly on the internet. The storytelling method badly worsens it with so many unnecessary scenes and lines. Towards the end of the series, I have to watch it with 1.5x speed, and still, it is irritatingly slow. That is not the worst yet. The SUPER CRINGE appearance of the VIPs just to show labor class discrimination is unacceptable and horrifically unnatural. They try to put on life-lesson so bad that the lesson turns out to be pathetically ridiculous.Tl,dr: this movie is cringed, poorly told, wayy overrated, and definitely one of the worst in this genre."
1502,Squid Game,"Absolute pile o drivel. We tried to watch this muck, we tried, to painful. Seriously bad cinema."
1503,Squid Game,"Lots of hype. Entertaining because it's quirky and keeps you engaged, but not good enough to justify a high rating. High rating is clearly a marketing campaign."
1504,Squid Game,Totally destroyed the show after VIPs sigh.It was unexpected yes but it totally killed the vibes. Also it is definitely overrated and the fact that kids watching this violence is just absolutely terrifying.
1505,Squid Game,The headline tells the most. The series in itself is great. But by the time the VIPs came i started cringeing. The Vips sound in their lines like the read it from a paper and their intonation was really bad. Otherwise great series.
1506,Squid Game,"Poorer Battle Royal-ish/reality-escape theme. Unoriginal, average story, poor dialogues, cliches, stereotypical. Seen this too many times before."
1507,Squid Game,"Seriously this show is so overrated. The plot is very cliche, mosy of the scenes are very slow, boring and with many unnecessary dialogues from either secondary characters.The whole storyline of the police man is non-convincing and feels and an insult to ur brain.For the few very few times they were about to pull a nice idea they son killed it with so many forced dialogues and repeated close out scenes on all characters for the same sittuation.It was absolute waste of time .. a proof that social meda can market a bad oroduct to be a trend."
1508,Squid Game,"Not for the faint of heart, but an original and imaginative story. You take interest in the players as flawed as they are. Yes, it is brutal and gory and, yes,I kept watching to the end."
1509,Squid Game,"Meh. At best. I really don't see why this has become a thing. The dialog is childish, the acting is horrendous, the plot is predictable, the pace is slow, the choices are unrealistic and the story is common. So what's the big deal about this mess?"
1510,Squid Game,"Did not really know what to expect going in but my goodness. The acting by the cast was incredible(except for the americans but that's okay they didn't have that big of a role). My goodness the emotional toll this show had on me was phenominal. Tears were shed, hearts were broken, anger was boiling. I rarely finish shows, but the grip this show had on me was unbelievable. I took a sick day from school and spent it binging this show. No regrets. So happy but also sad after watching this show😔 brilliantly made and i love everyone!"
1511,Squid Game,"Brace yourselves: there's a lot to process here, and you need to come fully equipped to do so.Wouldn't recommend to anyone under the age of thirty.A few characters are a bit underdeveloped. But otherwise, the acting is very good - even superb in some cases.A few scenes were a bit off though, a bit rushed.Do watch this in Korean: the dubbed version will not do it justice."
1512,Squid Game,One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Highly recommend watching it if you don't mind watching in Korean. The English dub isn't as good as the Korean version so I recommend you watch with English subtitles. Brilliant acting throughout.
1513,Squid Game,"The first and last episode are the weakest (least good), and the middle episodes are decent to good. But with the lame ending, it dropped the rating for me significantly. Hopefully this review will help you lower your expectations and you will enjoy it more than I did."
1514,Squid Game,The series is so good and so emotional it is itself the first series i watched in korean. Highly recommended!
1515,Squid Game,"A nice Korean thriller, you will be definately hooked to finish the whole series. But why is it having this much fuss and hype? It is not that good!"
1516,Squid Game,Watched this a little after the hype died down but really enjoyed it. It's been interesting to see how certain celebs have latched onto the aesthetic of this whilst the actual social commentary goes over their heads.
1517,Squid Game,"Great sets, interesting story but two things ruined it for me 1. Some of the actors were plain bad and killed the mood (especially the english speaking dudes); and 2. Just too much gore. The script writer also seems obsessed with giving organs away."
1518,Squid Game,"First off, I wanted to give this show a 7-star rating. As many other comments say, the horrendous, cringeworthy casting of the VIP's drag this down a star in itself. It literally ruined a whole episode. It almost seems surreal just how bad they are at acting.Apart from this though, the show is very gripping with a great idea behind it. Had the idea been executed to perfection, this should would easily be a 9, and maybe even 10. I'm not a big fan of the extreme acting that's often practiced in Korean movies, and this isn't any different. The actors play well, no doubts, but sometimes it's just too much.Scenery, camera-work and story is all pretty well done.But really, what makes this series unique and worth watching is the idea behind it. No matter if you like the korean film-style / acting, you should definitely give this one a watch - you won't regret it."
1519,Squid Game,"I've loved death game stories ever since I started reading the Gantz manga back in the early 2000's. Or maybe I watched Battle Royale before that... not sure.I'm something of a gore hound, and enjoy the mixing and intersecting of various character arcs in these extreme situations. Seeing many hit both their bests and their worsts in a short period of time. Some have redemption arcs, some fall from grace and end in shame. It's almost always a fun rollercoaster of emotions.Personally I'd rank this somewhere around the middle of the list for this particular niche genre. I don't quite understand how this one in particular became so popular. I guess that a lot of young people think this is a new concept.As with most visual media I've seen come out of Korea, this has superb cinematography but imo, it falls short a bit in the writing and acting. I vastly prefer the similar Japanese incarnations that stretch all the way to the unflinching, insane (sometimes hoaky) extremes that really embed them in your memory.I didn't like most of the cast and only found 2 characters somewhat likeable, with the rest ranging from vaguely annoying to insufferably annoying. I didn't really find any of them actually relatable.Plus, who's idea was it to cover the face of the most famous (imo hottest) actor they have almost the whole time?! Won't spoil it by saying who.Off the top of my head, I would rank these above Squid Game: Battle Royale I and II, Gantz (manga and movies are good, the anime suuuucks because they made it too early before the first arc was finished in the manga), As the Gods Will, Alice in Borderland, King's Game (anime, haven't seen the movie)"
1520,Squid Game,"The show has themes and ideas that convey intense meaning. It gives joy and laughter, and every character is thought out to great detail. Keeps you on the edge and wanting more. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel for character's as if you were them. Absolutely wanting and looking foward to a season 2. Brilliant."
1521,Squid Game,"The show in the beginning was interesting and unpredictable. It gave a glimpse of the desperation the lower class faces to survive in a cruel world. Emotional connections and back stories were established for most of the side characters making some deaths quite emotionally gripping.The biggest issues I have with the show are the twists. Mainly, Il-nam being the host of the show and the front man being the cop's brother. The old man's motivation for making such a gruesome game was because he was rich, bored and didn't see kindness in the world doesn't sit well with a lot of people. It made sense in the first game as he smiles as he walks past people being shot, but his behavior in the rest of the show is incongruent. There are other points to be made on the old man, but now I'll mention the cop's brother being the front man twist. It was shown that the brother was a previous winner of the game, but to leave a massive plot hole as to why he did this is insane. After shooting the cop and being briefly haunted by his decision is all we get from that. I personally found that cheap and lazy to bring shock to the viewers. Also, there is no excuse for the VIP's to have such horrendous acting. They can act all high and mighty, but the delivery was hard to watchDespite the interesting foreshadowing that hinted as to what will happen to the side characters in the future, it can't be helped that it was all marred by inconsistent writing and plot armor. An enjoyable show, but not an 8 by any means."
1522,Squid Game,"It's a great show, I enjoyed it and it's my first time to watch a korean Show.Amazing Director, Crew."
1523,Squid Game,"Netflix seems to be able to find these ""box set""versions of visual cocaine that make one unable to stop the 'next episode' button. This Korean paranoid vision of game show euthanasia does kinda feel like something I'd seen it before, Battle Royale, The Cube, Maze Runner and even The Prisioner spring to mind. However, if you can get past the slightly weird dialogue and the slightly uncomfortable attitude towards women then it's a beautiful looking and engaging series."
1524,Squid Game,A dangerous man? Great idea. But the VIPs are very poor characters.
1525,Squid Game,"With Parasite Korean things ruined by Every Director. They are ""Hollywood Kids"". Everything after ""Swiri"" Korean contends are shadow of American Movies and TV Show. I mean Not a story(some story too) film making. Everything is same. Lighting, editing, camera angles, everything is exactly same. Parasite is the worst result. So Oscar member think it's an American film so it got Oscar with lobby. Squid game is same. Have anyone saw John Woo's 90's movie?? Slow motions are so same I can't tell the which is which. Before mid 90s Korean Movie had very unique. Every director had different film making style. Now?? Nothing but Hollywood film making. I'm so sad Korean contents are just little Hollywood. After chaebul like CJ or Lotte make movie. It just product. Not an art anymore. But nobody cares I'm very sad."
1526,Squid Game,"This show is not worth your time and I don't understand why the rating is so high. It had bad acting, slow moving themes, and pointless actions. The ending sucked as it didn't really answer all of our questions or wrap up loose ends. I see no entertainment value in this show. In a world full a negativity, why enjoy seeing people needlessly die for people's amusement? It seemed like the writers didn't think through everything for some scenes as I often asked ""why didn't they..."" type questions. Please don't waste your time on this."
1527,Squid Game,"For the hype and reviews it is worrisome that the collective thinking sees no issues with this kind of cinematography . The movie industry, Netflix and the South Korean Squid Game series is made to globally desensitize the human population. Violence is presented as normal. The profound perversion of it all that glorifies the sick mind who produces these horrors without regard for the consequences this may bring? A global reception with laughter and excitement. Take some time out and think. There are voices, not only in South Korea that do not take lightly the dangerous degeneracy and wickedness with which Hwang Dong-hyuk fundamentally tainted every child's game. Already we are seeing the growing gangs of kids using violence as a game. The movie industry is not innocent when it comes to social mayhem. We saw the first mass hysteria and destruction of society as a result of the movies during the the William Monroe Trotter era. The cultural advances made by the North were completely destroyed and the South was able to rule the country while Hollywood did its part to facilitate. How movies and the media trigger trends and influence the peace and violence in society is greatly understated. Everyone knows that gambling kills. What is the rational reason behind this corruption of children games turning into a mass slaughter as a sport of the rich labeled as art, set to win nominations? The perversion that Man can hunts animals for sport has now extended into the realm that man can hunt man for sport? With his version of a Squid Game, that is nothing more than a variant of the Hunger Games, Hwang Dong-hyuk biggest achievement is the desensitization of the masses, the numbness of the senses towards violence. Viruses tend to mutate. Mental viruses behave likewise. About the ending, when the gambler fails to board the plane to see his daughter, this is probably the sole scene that adequately describes the suffering of society, the sickness of gambling, loans, artificially induced poverty and the sadism of those that exploit it - beginning with religions-. Apathy is the greatest human disease."
1528,Squid Game,When I saw the preview it didn't look that interesting but when I was on TikTok there was a scene they were playing a game it was so crazy and I'm like wow I need to watch it so I'm already on episode 5. If you want to watch something would blow your mind this is it.
1529,Squid Game,"Cliche scenes, Cliche endingThey will extend the series with a meaningless scenario to make money. Classic netflixThe hype for this show only about pr.4 rating for the episode and game production."
1530,Squid Game,Nothing to say about it. Just wanted to say go and watch this series. This is ridiculous and awesome series I have ever seen.
1531,Squid Game,"Those VIP were terrible and this show and the protagonist, down to the game of crystals is essentially Kaiji."
1532,Squid Game,"This was a great representation of how the world revolves around money and capitalism. It shows our modern day society in a brutal yet true way.Some scenes might be shocking for some audiences but it really puts your mind in a situation to think and see things in a more realistic way.People who are desperate for money are willing to do whatever it takes to take them, even die, betray and kill other people. It shows how everyone's true nature comes to the surface in the attempt to gain money. Yet the rich entertain themselves on the sight of desperation and think of these people as ""horses"" as they said that are just a piece in a game and their life doesn't worth anything more than to entertain them.This is the true nature of capitalism and our society. The richest man who created the games out of his boredom who thinks so less of poor people that are nothing more than pieces in his game, to the other rich people who just enjoy the games, to the head of the games, to the workers who are working for them and just obeying orders and who are also divided hierarchically and lastly to the players of the game who mean nothing. On top of that the head of the games continuously speaking of equality during the games giving them a false sense of equality when it actually doesn't exist because the rich are always worth more than them. So they create a false sense of security that every works out equally for everyone so they don't realize the real inequality that exists and that the only ones they have to turn against is each other.If we put this in our society, the people who hold all the wealth and can control the world, to the people who benefit from them like big companies etc, to the people working for them and obeying orders (working force who are slightly more advantaged than the players but also hierarchically divided like CEOs, managers, employees, etc ) to the less fortunate who struggle and are taken advantage of for the sake of the rich gaining more money and apart from that their life means nothing.I would definitely recommend it if someone wants to take a deeper look and don't just stay at the surface of the games."
1533,Squid Game,"This show starts out amazing, and progresses amazingly too. The characters are all so distinct, not exactly very deep, but they get the job done and have shocking and powerful arcs. There were moments that made me cry, which I wasn't expecting. There was a point around the middle of the season where I was ready to call this the best TV show of the decade.And then the VIPs came in.Their acting was atrocious, like The-Room-level bad. I was scratching my head at how these guys were allowed on set. My only guess is there must be a language barrier that prevents the show's creators from being able to judge good acting in American dialogue. Not only did the VIPs break the immersion, they almost made the plot less interesting because by then the show started to delve into the sort of Hostel-esque depraved-rich-guys-watch-the-peasants-scuffle tropes.However, this didn't destroy the show for me, and I could have overlooked it. But then the show just sort of fell apart logically. First there was the glass hopscotch sort of game where I was just wondering throughout the entire thing: Why don't the contestants try to cling onto the frame of the platforms once they shatter? Why don't the contestants hold on to their shoes to chuck them at the platforms to see which are tempered glass and which aren't?And finally, Sae-Byeok, easily the most compelling character in the show, dies in the stupidest way possible. What was the point of her character development, particularly that incredible and poignant scene between her and the girl with the nose piercing? It angered me to see such a promising character die in such a dumb way. And maybe part of that is just a visceral reaction because she was my favorite character, but I feel like there was so much more potential and it all just fell flat, leaving the viewer feeling cheated by the build up. It's almost like the show said, ""Yeah we need to kill all the characters off quick 'cause, uh, finale's coming up, 'kay, let's get this over with.""Then what follows is a very unimpressive and cliche fight between Seong Gi-Hun and Mr. I'm-Completely-Selfish-Until-the-Plot-Demands-I-Sacrifice-Myself; followed by a kind of cool twist where Player 1 reveals he's not just alive but an undercover VIP the whole time (which is neat and all but really ruins what was one of my favorite scenes--the marble scene between him and Seong Gi-Hun); and then Seong Gi Hun becomes a strawberry and decides to, like, go rogue against the VIPs or something.I wouldn't have minded Sae-Byeok's death if it wasn't so rushed and anticlimactic. I wouldn't have minded any of this if it didn't literally counteract all the amazingness set up in the first half of the show. It's almost like two showrunners were fighting over the same concept.I still really did enjoy the good moments of the show, however, and I can't overstate that. I sat back in awe many times and said, ""This is one of the best scenes in TV history."" I will definitely rewatch the show, especially the first 6-ish episodes. There was never a moment (even when the season started getting bad) that I felt bored or disinterested. I feel like this show raises the bar for Netflix and I'm glad I watched it.I just also can't overstate how bad some of the decisions were. If it weren't for them, this would be the best show of the decade. And it still is a really good watch, if you're ready to suspend your disbelief quite a bit and okay with feeling slightly empty and frustrated by the end."
1534,Squid Game,"In an era of binge watching & streaming any thing which manages to create a hype will find viewers. Now are you willing to take a moment to think before committing 9 hours for squid game or you just cant resist the trend and dont care about time anyway; is the question.For the thinkers out there! You dont even need to see the trailer to guess you are in for some thing like ""Hunger games"". The plot once again takes a jibe at capitalism and unequal distribution of wealth which is still fresh in our minds thanks to oscar loaded ""Parasite"". The plot is marred with implausables!!! Notwithstanding the debt crises, would someone be desperate and suicidal enough to put his life in the line with just 1 in 456 chance of winning??Squid Games does a good job in exploiting nostalgia of childhood games, thrill of puting life at stake and natural curosity of guessing the winner. The plot is unidirectional and an odd effort done to mitigate that is not more than a distraction and fails miserably in the end anyway. The storyline and some remarkable acting performances are at their peak around episode 6 and its all downhill afterwards. Even after the winner becomes obvious the climax brings some thought provoking takeaways on how money fails to provide pleasure and satisfaction to the filthy rich and the things they can resort to just for the forgotten taste of happiness.The violance is too much and seems like a deliberate effort to make life seem so indispensible. On the face of it we all are adult enough to know its all part of the entertainment bizz..but what havoc it may play with our subconscious, i am no expert to predict..."
1535,Squid Game,"This show is absolutely amazing and i would very highly reccomend it but it has one big flaw in my eye, how did they always set up the perfect amount of chairs and that, i mean in the steak dinner scene, you cant just tell me that they had a triangular table laying around."
1536,Squid Game,"I have to be honest, I have mixed feelings about the last episode. But with knowledge of a s2 being possible, I can accept an open ending. However the series really grips the viewer with a intriguing and honestly very realistic storyline. Also the actors really outdid themselves here, especially actor of my fave, the one and only, Jung Hoyeon. With most of the characters having well written arcs and you understand even the most nasty of characters. And hey, certain episodes (*cough cough* episode 6, and maybe also episode 8) really, really pulled on those heartstrings.I am aware that people are on the fence about the VIPs, and I am a little bit as well, however I think their basic indifference of people's lives and nonsensical conversations really checks out (see: the richest of the rich in capitalist utopia, aka the US).I feel like, similar to when Parasite came out, a lot of people misunderstand the message of the movie, or the real antagonist behind it all (hint: capitalism). Especially when some people started selling NFTs...It makes complete sense that this show took off, it's original, well written and keeps you on your toes."
1537,Squid Game,How in the heck does this show get such a high rating!!! I could barely make it through the first episode.... Horrible...Just horrible.....The worst acting ever.....And they dubbed it into English.... And the voice and mouth was so off.... That it drove me nuts!!!! I just have no clue what the hype is about the God awful show!!!
1538,Squid Game,"I checked it out after all the hype and it exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend this if you haven't seen it. The acting is good, storyline is good, scenery and special effects are good too!"
1539,Squid Game,Even if you're not a fan of dubbed over movies this will catch your attention. The story is incredible and messed up in a beautiful way.
1540,Squid Game,"The premise is interesting end entertaining. However, the character development is very poor and random (ie. Characters decide to suddenly become ethical out of nowhere and despite it contradicting their whole previously established traits).The justification behind the games is also very underwhelming even though it was meant to be some kind of big reveal.This show gives very much a ""we live in a society"" vibe... Some plot twists feel like they were written by a 12 yo middle schooler.I don't know if it's the norm for Korean shows but sometimes the acting feels cartoonist although most of the time the acting is pretty strong. Also beautifuly shot.6/10 don't believe the hype."
1541,Squid Game,"My score should be 8.5, but I will round it up.The bad:
Questionable ending which is suggesting a season 2VIPs acting and visit purposePolice substory is lacklusterThe good:
Well written and thrilling story inspired by multiple works in this genre, but piecing some of the best of each (Kaiji, Alice in Borderland, etc.)Different perspectives are brought to the table and the story allows the viewers to know a lot of the different characters.Original soundtrack matched the situation quite wellKR actors acting."
1542,Squid Game,"Squid Games' is the finest web series you can watch today on Netflix. And, if you are a fan of South Korean cinema, you will love every bit of it. They arguably produce the highest quality films in the world.Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!!"
1543,Squid Game,"Slow burn at the start, but we'll worth pushing through the first episode. The games are entertaining and full of twist and turns. Good character growth. Only thing that is stopping me from giving this a ten is, the rushed ending or so it seems and the VIP's less than stellar acting."
1544,Squid Game,"I think this is a great show for teens, but not for adults. The ""social commentary"" is very surface-level and predictable. I know its supposed to be a fun show, but the insane amount of plotholes and the typical ""over-the-top"" korean acting made it very hard for me to enjoy. I cant recommend it, there are much better shows on netflix."
1545,Squid Game,"Its good to watch but ending is absurd...it won't reach any conclusion...overall its a one time watch, there are some characters without a background story."
1546,Squid Game,The show is good. Has a great theme and everything BUT it is very predictable and some secondary actors are not good actors haha. Also they left hanging many things and forced many others to happen. Not saying them not to give spoilers.
1547,Squid Game,"When they kill the doctor there is 39 of them left.The woman was moved to the next game and 38 of them went to play the marble game, but when the game was finished only 16 of them came back and it should have been 19, since they played in pairs."
1548,Squid Game,Just another hyped up show with a plot that has been reused over and over again. It's basically a poorly written copy of the hunger games but Korean. The dubbing is terrible and the acting is even worse. The ending is so predictable its laughable. Honestly i fast forwarded through most of because it is incredibly boring for most of each episode. Also Every single character except one is a garbage excuse for a human being and deserves what happens to them.
1549,Squid Game,"The show shows a lot of bloodshed, betrayal, fights and trickery. I decided to watch the show because it was trending. Initially, I was enjoying it, knowing that the show was dark. However, things become emotionally tiring as you progress in the show. There are murders and suicides all throughout the series. The only hope was to see the villains get arrested but that also didn't happen because the only police officer who knew the reality was killed by his own brother.Cinematically speaking, however, the acting, the stage and the BG are excellent. That's why I would give this show 6."
1550,Squid Game,One of the recent best webseries... Absolutely entertaining.... Must watch.
1551,Squid Game,Absolutely nothing happens till the 3rd episodes. We just watch the actors chitchat with each other. The series would've been good if it was fast........
1552,Squid Game,I enjoyed watching this. But a few episodes to long. I still don't understand the ending. Hated the scenes with the white Americans (the script and acting here was average). Character development and acting by all Korean actors was great. An easy watch and quirky concept. Not suitable for kids.
1553,Squid Game,I enjoyed this show. Not suitable for children.Good character development and excellent acting by the Korean actors. Perhaps a few episodes too long. And I still fail to understand the ending. The script and acting by the American white actors was pretty average. Overall I enjoyed it. A quirky concept.
1554,Squid Game,"I can't wrap my head around this series, it's absolutely one of the best series I've seen. It's bingeworthy and keeps your attention all of the time. The characters have great development and the story is not afraid of killing off characters either (duh). But my favorite part has to be the design and symbolism. The colors, outfits, game rooms etc. From the boxes the corpses are put into to the contrast of colors. Everything just makes sense together. No one is safe in these games. And the ending is quite satisfying with a full circle moment. I recommend everyone to at least watch the first episode. If they enjoy it they will certainly enjoy the whole series."
1555,Squid Game,"This is a nice quasi-original concept (somewhat like The Hunger Games or Battle Royale) but suffers from having a non-likable main character.**spoiler**
The most likeable of the characters, that young lady from NK, dies before the end. It's unfortunate that most participants in the game act foolishly or lose control at inopportune times, making the action cringe-worthy.I would have rated this show more highly if the characters were not such disappointments."
1556,Squid Game,"The acting is terrible, the English translation deserves jail time. Choosing Ho Yeon Yung to star was brilliant because even if she can't act her face is enigmatic despite not having a single emotion on her face. The cosplay Korean BS is so over the top it's like watching Batman from the sixties. It is just another example of stupidification of the masses willing to eat what is shoveled out."
1557,Squid Game,"Loved it! Great performances from all leads and finishes on a brilliantly written cliff hanger. Twists and turns are all welcomed too. Fantastically choreographed action sequences, and I cannot wait for season 2."
1558,Squid Game,"Real cr@p acting poor dialogue poor dubbing but still hooks you in, twist at the end let's hope there is not a sequel."
1559,Squid Game,"This show is really good and exciting. The cast is doing a really good job and I cared for the characters. The sets and camerawork were also beautiful there was not much action but when there was it was well shot. And finally, the story was solid there was only one plotline that wasn't properly ended but aside from that it was really good."
1560,Squid Game,"This series was a breath of fresh air. The cinematography , the script , the acting in this series was amazing . I highly recommend people to watch this . The characters are so well put together and memorable. The games and brutality of it make it edge of the seat action!!"
1561,Squid Game,"I wont say much but just WOW. It has everything I was looking in a series & more.(Some saying VIPs sucked yeah but that doesn't affect the series much Idk why they're making it a big issue)
A total bingeworthy content kudos to the creators & actors."
1562,Squid Game,"Squid Game is in my opinion a great film brought down by some acting.Some actors and actresses didn't play their role too well, for example actors and actresses such as the girl that played 067 show very little emotion when on camera, it felt like she was just reading of lines.Never the less the movie was still good."
1563,Squid Game,"I can't say this is a ""spoiler alert"" because everyone else is harping on the subject.Many people reviewing this series are hung up on how well the ""VIPs"" can act. Think of it another way, can they just be ordinary people whom just come on for a ""guest"" appearance? Do they actually have to act?Remember the ""rich"" people of the world are self centered and don't really care if one is injured or not. Why would they want to have lines that actually mean something?"
1564,Squid Game,"I have to write this, because I love the show. Interesting plot and executed pretty well. I also love how your able to be both sides. If this was like most shows and movies, the red people would be a mystery that you never get to know about, but I love how this dives into the red characters side too. Most of the show is great but, it's that stinking Korean girl, the one who talks loud and annoying, got banged by the one mob dude, and carries cigs around (I don't remember her name). I get the show needs to make annoying characters, but she's soooo annoying i literally can't stand her scenes in the show. Y'all didn't create a character that made it difficult for the other characters to get work with, you made a character difficult for the viewers of the show to watch the show. But other than that love the show."
1565,Squid Game,"Predictable, boring, distastefulI watched this show because everyone was talking about it. My brother and father both told me it was great. I watched the first 2 episodes and I thought ""Alright maybe it needs time"".Then I watched the other 2 and I knew exactly what was hound to happen after.The plot was boring, the side stories were completely useless and the acting was below par. Don't watch it."
1566,Squid Game,"The show's writers need some alone time with the script to polish the rough edges. As an American, I don't know the principal actors or ""VIP's"" although I agree that the 5 main actors weren't given three best material in the first place.Misogyny runs rampant in the writers room with an unfair amount of women actors being put into some 1950's melodramatic saccharine.But it's fun. Lots of blood. Weirdness. Almost John Waters-esque."
1567,Squid Game,Starting out it easy to predict the old man is behind it and that the two kids from the start will be the final two and that the guy with the tattoo on his neck will meet a girl and they would die a villianous Romeo and Juliet type death. I literally wrote it down as I watched it to see if I right and due to the cliche story algorithm I was.
1568,Squid Game,"Oh no! How so ... The main characters are no longer made the most intelligent and strong, they have added humanity, and even without tolerance, what a horror ... But seriously, an excellent series, this is what modern cinema lacks."
1569,Squid Game,"Love this types of shows when they have to gamble for there survival. Its so good and you get cut up and you just cant stop watching. The only bad thing was of course the vip acting, almost as bad as my english! If you like this types of shows you should go and watch ""Alice in borderland"" on Netflix. I personally find it better and with cooler games, better story and better characters! But thats only my opinion:)"
1570,Squid Game,"All 9episoded are worth watching this is the one of the series that gives the impact of guilt, sadness, sorrow, love and all humans emotions. It has a very grip screenplay. I loved the background score and it elevates the scene and emotions to the next level."
1571,Squid Game,Predictible and scenario not realistic at allA bit pushed to the edge for no reason.Happy for the creator. He worked hard to make this happen.No big surprise and knew who would survive.
1572,Squid Game,"This Korean drama/series makes me remind of black mirror a lot because of the system of the game and the VIPs. I didn´t like how the VIPs talked because it seems they were reading... This serie talk about the things that someone is capable of doing to earn money, even kill the dearest person for you. Not everything it is what seems in this drama."
1573,Squid Game,"Keeps you excited, interesting twists and turns throughout the series. And then, then one of the worst and ridiculous endings ever. Last episode destroyed somewhat decent series."
1574,Squid Game,"Usually I hear about a hyped up show.. Watch a episode or two and feel let down but not here!Squid Game is special... I've recently seen it compared to Alice In Borderland and I must say Squid Game is far superior for the storyline, character development and eerie message of what lengths human beings will go to for money when feeling desperate.The only moment I questioned the show was during the first half of episode 2 which slowed down a bit but picked up again within the second half.After that I was glued to it and by the end I was left hoping for a season 2."
1575,Squid Game,"I give 10 out of 9⭐ for this masterpiece go and watch it. This series was blockbuster of 2021 and is awesome series and emotional scenes are best of this series it's story mind blowing Netflix's blockbuster series of the the world and South Korea I watched 9 episodes full entertainment and full drama I want season 2 soon
This is my review maine itne saalo Tak bahut saarii web series dekhi per ya wali kuchh alag hi hai aur ismein ki series a jaye to maja aa jaaye."
1576,Squid Game,"It's oh sooo popular despite being sexist, mysoginist, using cheap tricks to keep you engaged, and a ripoff to Sony Playstation. Also, it romanticize materialism.Why do they all don't want women? Not all games are sports. For all we know, the game could be one where women can compete well. Are you saying all women are less valuable than men, culture?Why do the last girl suddenly die? In a very bad plot? The game quickly go from a game where ""everyone have equal chance to win"" to ""everyone has literally random chance to win"", highlighted with the silly bridge game. It's not even a game, it's a plot device meant to kill all other characters. To top it off, let's end by it indirectly killing the said girl. Hooray, lazy writing.It uses cheap tactics to keep the viewers engaged. I admit it is hard not to click the ""next"" button. But when it ends, all I felt was I have been manipulated and cheated to watch a whole show full of contradiction and trash messages."
1577,Squid Game,"All episodes where ""hang on by the seat of your pants"" and the suspense for the up coming episodes were well worth the wait but I found the ending somewhat of a disappointment. It just left me hanging."
1578,Squid Game,"I have only watched the first episode but have a few thoughts.1) the concept of having desperate people compete for lots of money or their lives or both is not new so must have a unique idea included to be fresh
2) concentrating on a single character may not be good. The viewer must be sympathetic to this character must want the character to succeed
As for point one the visuals are good, using childrens games is ok but nothing special. Hope if evolves in future episodes. It would appear from first watching that some kind of societal control experiment is being carried out due to the scale of the games which could probably be only carried out at a governmental level - again this is old hat
As for point two the initial lead character is somebody (I at least) am not sympathetic to. He's an indolent ,addictive gambler of fairly low intelligence. I don't care what happens to him. Also like lots of other films, whatever close shaves he gets into it is unlikely that the main character will be killed off. Thus there is no tension he will survive ,maybe only just, every time."
1579,Squid Game,"What is the value of this show, yep... nothing, playing on people emotions while teaching younger kids garbage and fill their mind with selfishness and manners that we don't need in the world."
1580,Squid Game,"I loved the show and binged it through in one night. Great acting of the main characters. So all in all a great show, that was very emotional at times and had me on the edge of my seat. The show plays with a lot of moral dilemmas as well as drawing a critical portrait of the structural injustices of late capitalism, as well as the arrogance and misanthrophy of the super rich.Only a couple things in the plot were a bit sloppy / confusing:1) The cop - he manages to get in there and move around unseen for that long with cameras everywhere? When he's alone with the VIP and leaves him unconscious and naked - how on earth does that not bother / alarm the other VIPs? Shouldn't they be up in arms? And then his missing brother is actually working as a sort of head operator for the game despite only being missing for a short while? Why does the brother shoot him dead off that cliff, literal seconds after telling him he wouldn't do that and after telling his men to bring him in alive? Seemed so pointless. So many questionmarks and I feel there was room to play it out differently.2) The way the players behaved during the game. It was abundantly clear that this was a ""winner takes it all"" scenario, meaning only one would get out alive and win the prize. What on earth was going on with all the bonding and trying to ""get out together""? And then in the next moment they were all over each other killing each other with their bare hands over some missed food rations. It did add to the drama and definitely worked for the character development, but this seemed a bit random.3) The vote / return to the game. When they first voted to end the game, the old guy actually decided the vote with his vote. Why on earth would he do that. Just to motivate the players by going back to their old lives, to come back on their own accord? Seems an awful lot of extra risk and effort, having all these people back in the real world after the atrocities they have just witnessed. Also he had shared with the other players that he had a brain tumor and was dying, it would have made all the sense in the world, had he chosen to continue.Then they said: we will split the money among the families of the deceased. When the players returned, the money was still there.3) The VIPs poor / clichée acting and demeanor. Maybe it was actually intended, as the whole show is a parable for the injustices of late capitalism, which then again, apparently went over so many heads that it's not even funny anymore. ""They were there voluntarily, right?"" ""See what bad choices lead to?"" - No, it's a structural problem that made these people so desperate that a life and death murder game seemed like the more viable option than trying their best in the free world. How anyone can see that as their own fault and not see how the system is designed to exploit the vast majority of people into debt slavery while the 1% are so bored they literally start killing people for fun - well that is entirely beyond me. I wish more people would understand this not-so-subtle subtext of the show.4) The prize. I was actually surprised the winner even got the prize money in the end (and apparently there are no tax authorities in south korea) and they let him go, knowing what he knows. But even more surprising: Did the main character not have 4 million debt with some gangsters who were out for his blood? How could he have ""gone back to his old life"" in his neighbourhood for a full year - and not have touched the prize money - without at least paying off his debt?Still loved it."
1581,Squid Game,"Excellent show with incredible attention to detail on the psychology of different characters and how the relationships between these characters develop during the game. Definitely worth the binge in one night! The show is incredible in terms of scriptwriting AND acting and has an exciting unpredictability to it. Additionally, the soundtrack was brilliantly consistent and the repetitiveness helped tie all the episodes together.The only element in this show which was slightly worse was the acting of the VIP's from episode 7 and onward. They weren't too bad, but their acting was noticeably worse than the Korean actors."
1582,Squid Game,"I dont like the ending, instead of move on and visit his daughter, the main chose to play the game again?And the conversation among Vips really cringe."
1583,Squid Game,This show is absolutely amazing! You should definitely watch it.
1584,Squid Game,"The best series television on netflix. Please prepare for SEASON TWO i,am wait.."
1585,Squid Game,"The planes, the colors ... they caught my attention.I loved the special effects in terms of makeup, they are very well done, the slow cameras and the uncensored blood they put on is incredible.The story, I have to say, is very well about: we are all the same (no one is better than anyone), but we are all different (you do not know the problems that some people and their lives have). It's a great highlight in this series.Very emotional and thoughtful, a clear evolution of characters is seen, with the games and their companions.I read just today (I finished it last week) that they plan to do a second installment and that they are already ruminating ideas ... I do not think it is ""necessary"".By this I mean that the series is complete as it is, nothing is missing.If you really think you need more, make it up yourself."
1586,Squid Game,"I enjoy watching a lot of death game movies and shows similar to squid game, so when I heard its popularity I was instantly intrigued, not only was it so talked about, but it had really high critic scores. Now, I try my best to not have ratings or my expectations to cloud my judgement when watching, so that's not the reason why I think squid game is only a 7/10.With all the other content I've seen with similar foundations, this one stands out. Not only is it a series with a high budget, but it's Korean. I'm not well knowledgeable in the Korean culture, it's film/show industry or it's childlike games, but I was definitely shocked when watching this. Most western content I've seen usually has low budget and pretty weak acting, but this is the complete opposite here. These well written characters were so easily brought to life by everyone....except the VIPs but I'm sure everyone knows how bad they are. Not only was the acting incredible, but the accompanying score and visuals made it so this show was so excellently crafted.The main plot of squid game is relatively simple. There are people who need to pay debt and so they play games to win a lot of money, nothing original. They get tested/challenged by someone, who randomly goes up to them, targeting them, to see if they are worthy enough to enter their competition of children's games. This test is simple, play ddakji. Winner pays the other 100k won. Since the player cannot afford it after they lose, the businessman slaps them instead, and they keep going. The test here is, will the player keep on gambling the money they don't have. If so, then they get handed a business card, containing the number to call if they accept the invitation. So already, the start shows us how these games will work out, you're gambling something so heavy for something you so desperately need in return. So when they're on the island, they play 6 games over 6 days, death happens every time, you get the idea. I think it's here I should mention, there is a background meaning to a lot of this. The Front Man sometimes mentions about equality. However, if we take this morality of this, some events just don't match up. The biggest example I can think of is the bridge with glass tiles. This was so incredibly stupid that it was here (well before with the VIPs]) that started the train wreck of the show. In the other games, if you had a choice, you still were able to win:
-Choosing the shape for ppopgi, despite being at a huge disadvantage for choosing the umbrella, it is still possible to beat it.-Choosing teams for tug of war, even if you have a weaker time, you can have strategy to win
-Choosing the pair for the marbles, we saw many ways how this could be done, either manipulation, gambling, or skill, yet you still had a fair chance if you knew what you were doing. Even one guy playing used the morality of equality to try and increase his chances of winning because he knew that's how the games work.-But then you have the glass bridge. The commentary by the VIPs in the show were indeed correct. Going straight at the front and straight at the back are both disadvantages, which is true. However, the people at the front so clearly have a disadvantage that's it's basically impossible to win if you're in the first 9 people. Sure, there could have been strategies thought of to test each glass, but for games that made it so you still have a chance no matter what you pick, this is a bit out of place. Oh and that glass explosion at the end is incredibly stupid. Tbf this whole game is stupid, were they really gambling their entire playercount on 1 game? We know this is for entertainment after all, as they even decided to make the bridge harder last second. What's so entertaining about all your players dying at once?Ok so that's not to say every other game is perfect. Red Light, Green Light has the problem of bullets not being 100% fatal allowing for 2nd chances, other people being moved when half the game stampeded in retreat, the inconsistency of what considers ""movement"".Another huge problem with the show is the subplot. The plot of the detective (I think he's a detective?) searching for his brother. Not only did I just not care about this plot because we don't have much going for the detective character, but it's ending and setup is so flawed. Why not check on the constantly suspicious looking guard earlier? Why was he able to get away just because the doctor shouted? Why did he waste his only bullet at the end? And not only that, the reveal that the front man was his brother, whilst not obvious, wasn't ""WOW I did not see that coming"" either. In fact, after the reveal, the sub plot just ends. Nothing comes out of knowing who the Front Man is. This whole subplot was just useless in the end, and only served a purpose so we know what's happening with the doctor. Speaking of which, I get why he got shot in the end, but what if he was forced into helping the guards? Why did the guards even try to kill him when they need him for their scheme? If they had to kill the doctor, why not the other players who got told about the game by the doctor himself? You could probably remove around 90% of this subplots content and you would have the same thing in the end. The detective doesn't achieve anything, we the audience don't obtain anything out of it besides from an attempt of a huge shocking reveal.Despite my problems with the plot, the characters in this show are amazing. Nearly all of the ones we spend time with are unique, interesting and dynamic. Seong Gi-hun is an incredibly executed character. Being quite naive yet smart at times, he's more human than the characters he surrounds himself with, and yet overtime, his humanity starts to decrease, but it never breaks, even in the final game, he couldn't bring himself to kill his childhood friend, despite all that trauma, and even offered a withdrawal from the game. And yet, his emotions still cloud him. He's not perfect, he's a flawed individual. We see this so clearly at the start, when he finally wins ddakji and was about to slap the businessman, so eager for revenge, so into his anger at losing that he forgot what he was playing for. This was so beautifully mirrored in the last game, the squid game. At many moments, he had the chance to get victory, to walk into the circle. He didn't have to fight or kill his friend, he could have let the guards do it for him once he claimed victory, but because of his anger, he was too into it, he forgot what was on the line, and despite how in the first episode he was easily able to attempt the slap on the businessman, here he couldn't bring himself to kill him despite the fighting. It's so subtle yet that character development is huge. Although he definitely does have plot armour. Every single game, he won barely, always at the last second. Even with the fight against his best friend, he was about to die but quickly turned the tables. I'm fine with this happening for the first 2 games or so, but every time? It gets old and repetitive.Cho Sang-woo is another incredibly written character from the start. He's cold. He's in this to win. And, opposite to Gi-hun, his humanity actually breaks down as time goes on. Sang-woo is, without a doubt, the smartest player in the game. He tries his best to increase his chances of winning, he tries his best to eliminate possible threats. He's the cause of the most emotional scene in the entire show. He looks the least likely to be someone like him, and yet it makes sense. You don't want to feel human in this game, you need strategy to increase the chances of survival, him being this character makes him the smartest, and yet, Gi-hun can't accept it. Ironically, Gi-hun keeps calling him smart but when it comes down to his smartest thinking, Gi-hun rejects it. He rejects the fact his childhood friend is like this. Not only was their chemistry so natural, but when they had conflict, that also felt so realistic. My only problem is, I just don't feel like he's a real character himself. What I mean is, we know Sang-woo isn't a psychopath, he does what he has to do to survive, but yet he shows no signs of remorse. No guilt. And it would have been better if at the start of the show, he wasn't already like this, making his change much more damaging.Ok so Sae-byeok is a pretty ok character. She has an interesting backstory, but the show just doesn't utilize her to the best they could. In episode 2, we had the chance to see the main characters and their lives, them realising it's much better to be in the games. And yet, we barely get any screen time with her. I understand at this point she wasn't a main character yet, but they could have at least done something to make her feel more complete. And then with the marble game, we see glimpses of sadness from her after killing that one irrelevant female character, and yet, that wasn't touched upon either. And for the most irritating thing, her death. Ye her death is dumb. Well not all of it. I like the fact Sang-woo finishes her off, but the fact the glass even exploded in the first place is just a problem. I thought everyone was supposed to have an equal chance, Front man? I guess not. Felt like a cheap way to write in her death so the 2 childhood friends can have a 1v1 I guess.The other characters are great too, but unfortunately I don't have room to explain here sadly. Ji-yeong and Jun-ho are still irrelevant characters, Deok-su's death feels so out of place also, and the final twist at the end of the show is dumb.Also one thing that triggers me a lot about this show is the use of slow mos. Stop!"
1587,Squid Game,"Perfect. Absolutely incredible. Especially the last 4 episodes. A truly incredible message about life, death, struggle, success, and the poor and the rich. Fully entertaining for every second. There are very lovable and well developed characters that you can't help but get attached to, and evil characters that you can't help but hate. Great story. Definitely a 10/10."
1588,Squid Game,Amazing series definitely recommend. To watch. Perfect.
1589,Squid Game,One of the best web series.. Loved it🌸🔶all the characters are amazing.
1590,Squid Game,"Storythe game and the story of the main character is excellent but the ending is the only thing that made me give it 9, not 10
but the show is worth watching
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CharactersThe preforms are great and the writing of the characters are amazing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ExtraSoundtracks are unique.----------------------------------------------------------------------------"
1591,Squid Game,"The story of the police officer was just pointless. He achieved nothing, other than killing like 2 random people."
1592,Squid Game,"Even tho some elements fall flat, what works in this show works brilliantly. Whether the stunning visuals, gorgeous set designs and production value, interesting and likable main characters, spot on casting, the suspense of an engaging and unique story, decent plot twists, dark and mature subplots rarely covered in mainstream tv, good acting and more. I myself would also take great notice to the second episode, ""Hell"", that really makes great effort into showing realistically the sad backstories of our characters to justify why they would even put themselves in such situation.The flaws include a couple of bad performances, the VIP's seem like a really wasted opportunity to actually have memorable villains instead we got generic and awful eye-rolling performances, some decisions are questionable, the whole plot line of the cop had an underdeveloped ending that made the subplot feel pointless and underwhelming etc.But overall i def recommend this series as it is unique and engaging in a way that will leave you enjoying every minute of it and asking for more."
1593,Squid Game,"I just can't get enough of the games! What a mess! I hated saw, liked hunger games, loved this show. I loved all the characters. I didn't understand why they had those side stories with the harvesting bodies and the cop. Really added nothing to the story. Otherwise this show is so omg it'll keep you watching especially when all the bodies fall in red light green light. What a wild ride! I write novels and this writer did something in this story that I can never do to my stories. Kill them off! Lol."
1594,Squid Game,At first it kept being recommended on my Netflix didn't really care about it but bc it was 99% I was okay let's give it a try and I binged watched it. This show made me feel all differently types of ways and messed with my head but in a good way it was very well planed out and honestly I recommend it for everyone. The only bad thing is the VIPS it was weird I guess and it was very fake they had no personality except maybe creepy and that's it.
1595,Squid Game,OMG Korea!!!This is how is done!!!This is an exaple when you went above and beyond for a viewers!Recpect Korea!!!
1596,Squid Game,Addictive show. A lot of violence. Morality and immorality. The version dubbed into English takes away from the show. Watch it in Korean with subtitles.
1597,Squid Game,"It is entertaining but I wouldn't say it's the best. It's predictable and the acting was not what i'd expect from a show hyped so much. I watch a lot of kdramas and I can understand why it's hyped with people that don't watch kdramas, it is entertaining, deadly game.I love watching psychological thrillers, but this was the same trope over and over again. It's getting pretty boring. I gave it 5/10 because it was entertaining at some points to watch, but I wouldn't say it's good.A lot of psychological thrillers like tunnel, train, abyss, etc. Are a 10/10 to me."
1598,Squid Game,".Nice and creative story, but failed to deliver it as a horror or thriller show..Too many long , boring and silly conversations."
1599,Squid Game,"This was... actually kind of good. Well, most of it. The show had great twists and made me kinda sad but there was one problem... the vip's. They were so cringey and the dub for the show in general was hilariously awful. But apart from that, I recommend it greatly."
1600,Squid Game,Absolutely loved this series but was a little disappointed with the last episode.Would definitely recommend and hoping for a series 2.
1601,Squid Game,"I have to admit I haven't watched it all yet, but the first few episodes I have seen are not what I expected. I am loving it but for my sanity, I need to take it slow. Acting is great as is the plot. Idea and really everything. I recommend it...but be prepared."
1602,Squid Game,While the series is not terrible I dont think it is as excellent as people are saying. First the acting is a bit mediocre. Maybe it is the way it is coming across from Korean to English but there is something off about it. I had a hard time getting into it and feeling like i wasnt watching a bad B movie. The premise is interesting but the execution is just sloppy. Just my opinion though.
1603,Squid Game,"I had been waiting for a month to watch this series with my partner together, I was very excited. Until last night we saw it and I am very disappointed 😐
all the praises for this? Rotten 91? Really ?overrated. In my opinion, many people who had a positive opinion did not see movies and series like this. Of course, doing copying doesn't matter at all, if the execution is good. You know what I mean? You can copy but if you have a good performance why not, you can be the best. Unlike this series. :/1- In the first episode, I guessed the end of the series. I predicted everything, even the dialogues. See how cliché a series must be that I can predict so fast and not even a single one was wrong!2- The first episodes, when they got the policeman involved in the story, I liked it very much and I thought to myself that it was going to be interesting. But that didn't happen, the policeman struggles were not shown and there was not even any stress, and he was like Hitman! Or like an American spy Hollywood movie with an Indian theme ! Which had minor bugs.3- The first few episodes were very important for the backstory and story settings, but in these episodes, emotions were expressed in a dull way; Also, again, in a clichéd way, the characterization was mixed with melodrama if it could have been done more delicately, it would be great.And None of the characters grow up, the cliche bad and good always.4- there were not any backstory in some scenes where it must have a back story. There were Scenes where it could be symbolized, but no attention was paid to it. There were contradictions in some scenes and even in the story. Some flashback's timing were wrong and leaked the story further. The soundtrack was not good.5. The VIP section was awful; Apart from the bad acting, their voices and accents was awful and their script and dialogue were the worst part of the series.6. There are much better movies, series, mangas and even video games with this concept, maybe sometimes more creative and well-made. When you copy this concept, you have to present something different to be the best, unlike this series.The positive points if I want to say:
1- they voluntarily had to choose to return to the game, it was a new thing and I liked it.2- great acting (except VIP)Now let me tell you the list:
-battle royale 2000
Most subsequent films and series were inspired by this.-3 percent.Most importantly, the same 3% (3%) series that Ive watched four years ago, and I certainly say that everyone should have seen this first.-Alice in Borderland
hunger gamescube 1997-Kaiji series
-king's game,
-would you rather,
As the Gods Will,which also played the game green and red lights.-Escape room
-Saw ,
-Movie circle,
the belko experiment,-Future Diary anime
And battle game in 5 second (average)
liar gameAnd other movies, series and manga."
1604,Squid Game,"In my opinion the end is better than the start. In the beginning I disliked the main character to much. He is over the top with everything in an unrealistic way. And this is how the show went on as well.The games are refreshing and something else. But the duration in between the games is to slow. Especially when they step out and come back in. You know from the beginning they will go back otherwise we don't have a show. So in that episode I thought get it over with and hurry up. That feeling didn't go away the rest of the episodes, everything that happens could be told a lot quicker and shorter. Maybe it would have been better as a movie.In the last episodes the main get's protective about other players and cares way more, so that maybe explains why I liked those episodes better.The English speaking VIPS where more of a stereotype than real people. I think they have said the number 69 ten times in one episode. That was really annoying, and a weird way to portray them.The storyline with the cop was very good in the beginning. Someone from the outside inside to watch and maybe expose the game. But in the end he dies and all the work he has done is for nothing. Looks to me if they only have written him in to show us some aspects that we otherwise wouldn't have seen. So it started well but turned out to be a dead end.So overall you won't totally waste your time watching this series. But it's not as good as I was expecting it to be."
1605,Squid Game,I actually binge watched the whole series in 2 days. It's that good to keep me wanting to know what happens next. 😋 I hope they make season 2 because is a really well made series. It's unpredictable in that you cannot quite figure everything out. You feel like one of the contestants and feel their surprise and nerves as they try to survive the challenge. I give this series ten stars since it really deserves it. ❤
1606,Squid Game,"Squid Game lives up to the hype. The ""artistry"" of slo-mo gore set to beautiful music is mesmerizing and easier to watch than you might wish. The size and impact of the sets, such as the Escher stairs and the massive bunks, are truly impressive. This is a well-funded production bringing the writer's vision to life. That the characters and acting style are based on traditional Eastern theater only reinforces the dreamy surrealism. Forget the political analysis. Money is power and some folks are desperate. This is a bad dream in the best sense. You'll want to tell others about it."
1607,Squid Game,"I've been enjoying Eastern shows the past couple years, I really enjoyed Alice in borderland and it left me with an itch wanting more and squid game certainly scratched that itchI'm unsure on whether or not there is some source material this is drawing from so I'm just basing my opinion solely on the show itselfI don't really have any problems with squid game, my main complaint is there wasn't more episodes or games."
1608,Squid Game,"I thought this would be another overrated tv show but it exceeded my expectations, The suspense is very enjoyable if you like scarier entertainment but and gore is very practical and fun, overall I gave it a 10/10 because it's a very fun show especially when your self isolating from your family when you have Covid lol!"
1609,Squid Game,"I LOVED this show, you can binge-watch it, it's addictive.I don't like horror and blood, but this one was more of a thriller-suspense, even I liked it.It's a mix of: the chess scene from the first Harry Potter, Black Mirror and The platform.It's very hard to guess what's coming next, it keeps you interested and guessing."
1610,Squid Game,"A new addition to the ""battle royale"" genre, Squid Game adds a refreshing take.The situations in which the characters find themselves is heart-rending drama. I've seen some reviews claim that the show attempts to legitimize the shock value violence by hiding behind a poor veil of human interest/sociology 101, but I honestly find the show gripping, and I finished with genuine interest in the characters portrayed.Be forewarned - it is violent and at times difficult to watch, but if you can get past that, you'll find a gem."
1611,Squid Game,"Best movie killing game movie ever. I love how it's put together. Green light red light, marbles, cookie cutting, ETC! I love it no matter what. Yayayayuayyayya it so da best."
1612,Squid Game,This is the first Korean web series I've ever watched in my entire life and I watched it just because everyone were talking about it and everyone were appreciating it and that's why I watched. Must watch series full of drama and good story. Overall good experience watching this series.
1613,Squid Game,"I lived it S. Korea for half a decade and regularly watch kdrama so i encountered this show before it became a sensational hit. And I do recognized most of the actors in their many different shows.How is that relevant?I say that to highlight that I am not ban wagon rider but a regular k-drama viewer,. With that said, I do welcome all the new K-drama viewers and hope that it's not just a one off.The show itself highlight a very important social issue that hits so close to home. The games in the show itself appear very simple yet are intense and maybe plausible if anyone were to be in the same situation.The conclusion however left a little more to be desired. The main characters decision's seems questionable."
1614,Squid Game,"Great show but hard to watch without cry at some point, even the part where the girl is killed. The show also is just about life and it's hard ships watching it gave new meaning to life."
1615,Squid Game,The basic idea behind the show isn't really out of the world about how you have to compete to death to gain something but the twisted fact that the show turns children's games to their ugliest and gorriest possible versions makes it a horrifying yet glued to Netflix kind of a watch. You're really missing out if you don't watch this one!
1616,Squid Game,This Korean series was brilliant and quite shocking in so many ways. It has lots of very unique violent scenes that at times I found myself stunned for a moment but loving every second of how this show pulls you in. You can really feel for so many of the characters and I found myself really rooting for my favorites but knowing in the back of my head that they will all probably die in this crazy life or death game one after another until it reaches the winner. Episode 6 Gganbu is so mind blowing and heartbreaking. I'm sincerely hoping we get a season 2. We need more squid games minus the ridiculous VIP's or at least get them to speak like an actual human being would. Geez! That is the only reason I didn't give this rating a 9.
1617,Squid Game,"Absolute banger, one of a kind . The idea of children's games being practical for billions is just great. And this looked so real, that's the thing you won't get in anime. Looking back at all the players who died is so sad, especially those who didn't even deserve it .And the ending was just so brilliant and assuring a second season , maybe even third. I expect the next season's to be even better ,maybe even 10/10 , extremely hyped for them."
1618,Squid Game,This is an amazing and innovative show. Everything from the sets to the soundtrack was top notch. Each episode had me hooked not knowing what to expect next.
1619,Squid Game,"A good show with a good idea, different compared to the other shows of our days. Characters are well written, and so the plot, but sometimes can be a little to fast, like written in rush, but Onlus a few times. Finally something different on netlfix."
1620,Squid Game,"The series is addictive from the first minutes. Every episode you sit and you can't just sit back. The plot is interesting to the point of insanity, the games are super interesting, the characters have their own story, this is a huge plus. I advise everyone to watch it!"
1621,Squid Game,"It's a 10/10. Just edit out the VIPs, you don't need them at all. Loved it. A masterpiece."
1622,Squid Game,You can show the message using less disturbing means. Absolutely a no go for children. Interesting but way too cruel. Too much blood and too much slaughter. The only spot left is some hard porn... Everything else was pushed to the highest limits.
1623,Squid Game,"Finally we get to watch something original. Minimum amount of cliche vs the other netflix series... Nerve-wracking games are so interesting to watch. Needless to say there is a lot of blood that Q Tarantino would be jelaous... SPOILER: ""we will die together..."""
1624,Squid Game,"Interesting and a smart story. Until the VIP guests comes, all looks perfect. Unfortunately the performance of non-Korean cast is far below the Korean cast. Other than that, I have really enjoyed the series."
1625,Squid Game,Too short. Need more. Watched all the episodes in one day. Could not stop.
1626,Squid Game,"Too many bloody, violences, cruelties, and inappropriate scenes. I suggest that it could be made softer and a bit more elegant, then it could be more interested to watch it. I can only give it 10 starts because I cannot make that movie, but I can help them to make it better."
1627,Squid Game,"To many similarities with The Hunger Games. The contestants do have a choice whether to participate, though.Too many plotholes as well."
1628,Squid Game,"As many people already said: it's VERY disturbing. And I've seen a lot of disturbing things.This show will confuse you and will engage you. True emotional rollercoaster. For me - it was brutal. A little too brutal. It was brutal to the point I had to disconnect, sit back, thinking it's just crazy. Sick.But under all this brutality - incredibly beautiful. As life, as its true beauty you can only appreciate in the context of death. My brain was freaking out. On a subconscious level - I was playing a game. I was barely surviving. I loved and I hated. I was crushed and I was happy.This show was way too original to ignore. Way too fresh.Good idea. Many surprises. OK, I guessed 2 plot twists, but still, it was surprising. Not a cliche. Not ""another show"".Most of the time - completely different experience. Good acting. Interesting characters. Intense action.Yes, I wanted to unwatch this. But then again, one of the best shows I've ever seen. I think I will never see games (any games) the same again ;)"
1629,Squid Game,"If something is a hype, I usually pass. But my friend forced me to watch. I liked the decors and outfits , but that's all. This series is not ""brilliant"" as some may. For me , the series is boring, filled with social clichés. There are much more interesting Korean to watch ⌚"
1630,Squid Game,"Many people have their ""taste"" right in the middle of the group, just like in episode 7, where they have to chose a number. Many people rate this series high, just to be safe in the group. Just as fashion and so on.It's natural so don't be ashamed.."
1631,Squid Game,"What a treat ! Edgy, emotional. Above all ? Disturbing. I wasn't expecting much to be honest. Oh boy was I wrong.Nicely produced, almost perfectly executed. You feel the tension from start to finish. The actors are are spot on (apart from the VIP's in episode 7).You feel and want to know more about them.This is how good it is.Have a go, you won't regret it.Pure entertainment."
1632,Squid Game,"Thank goodness for Netflix, Korean TV production, and the SQUID GAME. Thoughtful, captivating, engaging. Although the first 2/3 of the first episode were almost boring, the last 1/3 of the first episode hooked me for the rest of the series. Episodes 1 - 9 were all great. I sincerely wish more American TV and storytelling were like this. I also hope that nothing further is done with this. Anything more would spoil what it is."
1633,Squid Game,"This film try too hard to be another Parasite but fail in many way.About the battle royale, main character is way too useless from the beginning to the end. He contributed almost nothing to the game. His arc is just too simple, nothing significant changed. The games are designed simple and pure by chance most of them. It required nothing smart or outstanding physical.The VIP and bad guys are stupid as heck. Who write those characters ?The plot twist is not that twist anymore since you can easily guess it. Who haven't seen that classic horror movie franchise ?There are a lot of better movies out there in battle royale or social issues. This one does not earn its score."
1634,Squid Game,"Not a bad show, but definitely very overrated.Some scenes are strong, and deliver a message, but parts also seem meaningless. Was looking forward to this, and tried to stay positive...."
1635,Squid Game,"Well written, excellent dialogue and all tied together very well, the humour keeps it from being too depressing or gruesome and the acting, pace and the way it was shot all comes together really well for an excellent watch."
1636,Squid Game,Was recommended to watch the series and watched all episodes over a few days. There are good moments and great characters here and there. But overall the series can be described as a friend of mine said as gore-porn. If you like bloody series like the walking dead then this is something for you.The series starts strong but struggles to keep the level.I hope that they do not make a second season as this should just stand alone.Happy to have seen it. Not going to watch it again.
1637,Squid Game,"Another shining example as to why more people should stop betting on an old horse like Hollywood and start putting their money on International Cinema. In this instance it's Korean cinema, Squid Game is a beautiful example and a potential gateway drug for many to get into Kdrama or maybe just international cinema in general. If you're tired of the sequels, prequels, reboots or remakes then take a risk into the world of subtitles and watch this. You'll find yourself with something new, fresh and potentially eye opening."
1638,Squid Game,"The idea is great, no matter that it's similar to the Hunger Games - after all the original script is not earlier then 10 years old, before being financed by Netflix. I'm really impressed by the South Korean's actors - incredible work! Nevertheless the plot was very predictable and on top of that I know what is going to happen and it's happening for 10 more minutes on the screen - very slow and protracted action ... There were some moments, like the dead of the policeman/ brother, where I wasn't sure what am I watching - Indian tv series with a lot of slowmo reactions to a dramatic action or what?"
1639,Squid Game,"Interesting, but not original and with over the top dramatic acting that I personally don't like. That are much better south korean shows out there."
1640,Squid Game,The story line is way too predictable and there are too many plot holes. 5 stars are for Hoyeon .
1641,Squid Game,"All the main characters were pieces of sh.., Gi-Hun is a worthless human being who forgets his daughters birthday then gambles the money his mother gave him away. Someone who actually cared would have given us someone to cheer for."
1642,Squid Game,Comedy. Great acting! Love this. Can't wait for season 2.
1643,Squid Game,The series was really interesting and entertaining till the last half an hour of the last episode. The ending is rubbish.
1644,Squid Game,"The show is a bit overhyped but it has its reasons. It was good for a long while until the very end.I like the show from start til episode 8.The last episode felt like it ruined the good things in the show. I wouldn't discount the good story but I still cant get over what happened in the end. Is it just to have a second season? I wish it could have been done differently though. I would much rather have a good happy ending where he just lives normally with his daughter and adopt Sae-Byeok's brother not just leave money for an old woman to take care of.The show isncalled squid game but the final game didnt really justify squid game properly as they both end up fighting for survival. I mean at least make the series reasonable with its title. We spend so much minutes on ther challenges and we could barely get 30 minutes on squid game.He could have straightened his life instead of going after the squid game organizers.Also what happened to the cop? There was no definitive ending for him. Was he really dead? Was was there no closure for him and his brother?But I wouldnt discount the good plot. Overall I like the story. It is really good and the characters really showed passion in their work. There were some hit and miss especially when the vips came to the scene, they have the worse acting.Overall, This is still a great series just really cant get over the final episode."
1645,Squid Game,It's like producer/director never met or see any English speaking person.
1646,Squid Game,"Never mind about the VIPs bad acting comments. They play such a secondary role and they have few seconds in a couple of episodes. Yes, they suck, but it doesn't have any influence on how good the show is.It's an amazing show that is way more than that. Outstanding performances from korean actors, great storytelling, and korean approach at its best: drama, thriller and comedy all in the same box.Have fun!"
1647,Squid Game,"I found the show to be fantastic, only ruined by the horrible VIP acting."
1648,Squid Game,"When this series does things right, it's brilliant. The games in episodes 1 and 4 stand out as excellent, and episode 3 is solid. It's at its peak when it's about the games - simple, tense standalone stories, with interesting strategies and high stakes.The issue is when it tries to branch out. Every time more is revealed about how the games work and the people behind them, the story makes less and less sense. By episode 7, the English-speaking characters that come in are nothing short of cringeworthy, both in their acting and the dialogue they're given (they're supposed to be villains, but it's not that kind of dislike - it's more like dislike of the actors and whoever wrote their dialogue). The best games were shown to us, pure storytelling that barely needed dialogue at times, yet by episode 7 for some reason they decided we needed a set of poorly-acted idiots to give us a running commentary to explain a very simple set of events.There is also increasingly an issue throughout the series of certain characters acting with such ridiculous stupidity in order for the plot to work.There were some great moments in this series, but unfortunately it started showing its flaws in episode 2, and in the final few episodes it goes from a flawed show with a unique charm and great moments to just... rubbish."
1649,Squid Game,"I didn't like it myself as I find watching it was very disturbing. The violence in this series is far beyond acceptable standards for any TV show and the story is not that great either. There's so much better stuff to watch out there, don't waist your time on this miserable show please!"
1650,Squid Game,"This could have been great. The writing is just really sloppy. I can look past the bad acting from some of the cast because it fits in the Korean and Anime style/genre, but the plot holes and bad writing is a deal breaker. Just one example: in the tug of war episode, they had to break up into teams of 10 ppl. But there is no way there would naturally have been the correct number of people to make exact teams of 10. Just bad writing. It's been hyped a lot. There are lots of these types of instances, but I won't type them all."
1651,Squid Game,"The idea was good, that's it.Acting and dialogue B Movie style.Apparently I have to have a review of at least 150 characters, but there's nothing more to say."
1652,Squid Game,"I was expecting so much from this based on the reviews, media hype and general attention it has been getting. Battle Royale is one of my favourite films so was looking forward to a modern take on that.This has been pretty average throughout, the premise is interesting enough but the games are slow, overreacted whimpering, heavy breathing and an attempt to build suspense. I've watched it dubbed in English and original with subtitles, both are equally underwhelming.Some of the characters just annoy the hell out of me, particularly the woman with the curly hair.It's soooo slow, the games get dragged out to the point you either want to give up or skip forward to get past the filler chat - who cares that tempered glass is 700°?Aesthetically it's very pleasing, the sets are great, the wardrobes give it an edge... this will be the Halloween outfit of the year.All in all it's just about watchable, but the thing I take away is ""is that it?""."
1653,Squid Game,I lost it at the end of the Gganbu episode. Amazing show.
1654,Squid Game,"First I thought it was rated by Koreans only who were driven by bias and not merit, but seeing the high rating coming from the western world makes me question our mental state and not theirs.Pointless extrem violence/murder is not relatable, period. In this series it is also accompanied by stupid storyline, hectic dialogs, and very poor acting. Result? Highly rated , most watched series. Well done us, how did we get here??"
1655,Squid Game,The concept is not new. We have Saw and many other such movies and series.But this is slightly differently directed and made. I liked the slight positivity they showed.
1656,Squid Game,"Ali get betrayed like no other, rip. That is the moment in the show where I truly realized how evil number 218 was."
1657,Squid Game,"This series has the worst acting I have seen in decades. Without a doubt. Pathetic performances by some actors. And the music is comically bad. Furthermore, the errors in details bother me tremendously, but that is a personal issue I suppose, that likely won't bother many others.The premise of the show is obviously its main attraction, and it keeps me glued to the screen, unable to stop watching. This is also the reason I give it a 4/10 instead of the technically merited 1/10.Expect no logic whatsoever, brace for some occasional awful acting, and it might be bearable. Watch it for its novelty. Then forget about this as soon as possible, and move on."
1658,Squid Game,"Are we supposed to feel empathy for a man who becomes a billionaire and then chooses his own vindication over his daughter? Plot is boring and shallow, characters don't develop and the reason behind the games is 'rich people get bored'.Full of tropes, misogyny and a sprinkling of racism. Not even that gory, not scary or tense, and the VIPs are like true blood's worst reserve actors."
1659,Squid Game,"Excellent show. When my 13 year old daughter told me she wanted to watch this show as many other kids in her grade were watching it, I thought it was going to be some kind of boring anime. Wooh...not even close. This is an awesome show. I was hooked after the first episode. Yes, there can be some slow parts but it's totally worth it getting through those slow parts because you'll be rewarded later. Just keep watching. My kids were so excited watching it they were yelling out at the tv. If your kids are not used to watching violence on TV then I would not recommend this show to younger viewers; my kids are used to watching scary/weird stuff so it didn't bother them, and they know the blood is fake.Anyway, great show!"
1660,Squid Game,If you are looking for a show with amazing performers (except the vip) then you need to watch squid game. Episode 6 is heart breaking. A tv show has yet to make me cry yet this one did. If I could give another standing ovation then I would.
1661,Squid Game,"I like it a lot but what i don't understand is why they screem so much even when there is no need to screem. The games are violent and bloody, a lot of stressfull situations and hard choices to make. Overall i liked it."
1662,Squid Game,I honestly don't know what all the fuss was about. I watched it and thought the entire series was mediocre at best.
1663,Squid Game,"Because covid, during lock down, I was shocked about how many really bad movie out there. How does the script writer made a living by pulling out these story line from the other end? This TV series simple just a good indication that Hollywood has no more new idea now. Just like ""slumdog millionaire"""
1664,Squid Game,"It grew on me after the first episode, it was somehow addictive so that must say something about me. It lost it's appeal when the VIP's were introduced, rich American businessmen who pay to see people get killed, I get that that is the story but the really bad acting and dialogue of these guys was cringeworthy. Shame, because the Korean/Pakistani cast were exellent, each and every one of them."
1665,Squid Game,"Same as other reviews I thoroughly enjoyed this unique show until the arrival of the VIPs they distracted me from what was a brilliantly acted escape to suddenly being back in the room feeling like I was watching a cheap American TV movie. Please don't bring the VIPs back for a season 2 they were totally unnecessary to the story, I imagine it's actually difficult to find such awful actors."
1666,Squid Game,"Don't see the hype , the show is mediocre at best I'm not impressed it's literally a hunger games type show. I doubt the next season will be any different."
1667,Squid Game,"Good writing, good acting for most part (except the American actors), good messages, pacing is good.There really isn't much to complain about it once you're immersed into it besides the voices and acting of the American actors."
1668,Squid Game,Superbly made. This is something different that was made with thought and passion. If I don't recommend it to others then I don't actually what's actually one should. Bravo!
1669,Squid Game,"Fairly above average for Netflix. Yet very predictable, the characters were shallow and most of them very annoying. From the moment the old man 001 was so called shot (but not seen being killed) en the episode ended with the shot of a wrinkly hand taking the rabbit mask off... 🙄 Who OH who would be behind the frontmans mask? Very predictable...
The storylines and -themes were randomly and shamelessly stolen from other movies.6/10. Amusing but no material for a cultstatus. I think they orderd too much red overalls for CDP and made something new to recycle them..."
1670,Squid Game,"It was a very bad series. In fact, it was an incomplete and dirty copy of Kaiji anime. This series had a lot of story holes. The story structure took on the dark aspects of Darwinism but could not show the consequences. Director By putting on pleasant music, tries to make the audience sympathize with a psychic killer who has killed many people. The series is very immoral and is not recommended at all because it portrays humans as animals without any consequences for this. I also do not understand the director's opposition to religion and God. As if he just wanted to attract the attention of big companies. I suggest you watch Kaiji anime because it is really a masterpiece. ."
1671,Squid Game,"The games are a nice feature, but it feels very familiar. It's also not that exciting a lot of the time. It's OK. Not sure why there are so many incredible reviews."
1672,Squid Game,Firstly no spoilers here.I don't recommend you watch the dub. It's very distracting and can take away the seriousness of the show at times.Its so good. So amazing. Loved it to pieces. Each episode left me wanting more. But then to keep from going through the show too quick I limited myself to two episodes a day.Totally worth it as waiting 24 hours between every 2 episodes really added to the suspense of the show.Highly recommend.
1673,Squid Game,It started way much better than it ended and by mid-season the series had too many useless long scenes that didn't help the drama...The characters build up was good and most of the main characters has depth but all the events are way way too predictable and in too many instances you waste 5 or more minutes of watching things you already know it will happen with no twists happeningAlso at the first few episodes it had meaningless flashbacks to things happened literally 3 mins before which made feel weak and and shallow...
1674,Squid Game,I don't understand why people were overhyping this average series. Very predictable. I can list you 10 better series/movies with more mind-bending plot twists.
1675,Squid Game,A unique film and a nice concept. I was enjoying this series until the VIPs arrived and ruined it in about episode 5 or 6. I think these VIPs just happened to be teaching English in Korea at the time and applied for some extra cash. The acting was horrible and severely cheapened the whole film. It left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the series unfortunately. I can't recommend this film to family because the acting form the VIPs is just so embarrassing.NETFLIX - remove/replace the VIPs with real actors - budgets can't be that tight.
1676,Squid Game,The show is still great though and can't wait for season 2.
1677,Squid Game,My first Korean drama ever. I love the death genre and this has to be my favorite. Everyone acted so well and the story was compelling. Art was great.
1678,Squid Game,Really enjoyed this. Thought it was just going to be full of blood and guts (which there is alot of) but actually I found myself getting invested in the characters and enjoying the moral dilemmas the characters have to make. Looking forward to a second series.
1679,Squid Game,Me and the missus really enjoyed this series we watched it all in the evening.Saying that we both thought the ending was a little too predictable and we both had an inclination about the ending from episode 2.Give it a watch by all means because there's some really good characters and action but don't expect a blockbuster ending.
1680,Squid Game,Remarkable series but the VIPs must be the worst actors i've ever seen.
1681,Squid Game,"Idea was solid, but it was nothing new. There are plenty of movies about people getting killed or killing each other as part of a game for wealthy folks. VIPs ruined big portion of the last three episodes, they were a disaster. I don't understand why they went with some poor actors spitting lame lines in poor English, they could have introduce some serious Korean VIPs. Last episode was disappointing and the winner was known from the very first episode which made the game pointless to watch."
1682,Squid Game,"Loads of reviews detailing the series so won't bother going in to that. What Netflix needs to do is to get the director to re-edit the series. Remove the VIPs, the doctor, organ trafficking and missing police brother storyline. Keep it really tight on the games and the contenders. Reduce it to just 5 or 6 episodes. Call it Squid Game: Redux or something. Would be perfect."
1683,Squid Game,One of the best shows on netflix in recent times . Background score is just amazing.
1684,Squid Game,"... they didn't try to include a moral story. I really liked the look of the series and all the locations in it. There was a lot of potential to tell a story with an unique vibe. But besides of the fact that most parts of the storyline were predictable (it often felt like the series was produced for people who never watched a series before), it is not very profound or smart of the main character that he agrees to participate in a game to kill other people for money in the first place, and in the following days he notices that it was a cruel thing to do. One year later he even played a game again while risking that a homeless person freezes to death. Looks like he didn't learn a lot."
1685,Squid Game,"I felt like I booked hunger games on ali express. However the show was very catchy and mostly predictible. I enjoyed watching the games and the emotions after it. The end with the VIP is very very bad, which brings me to an average/good rating."
1686,Squid Game,Besides a few bits of bad acting this series was very entertaining.👏
1687,Squid Game,"I rarely watch non-American TV shows or movies but the plot of this show just pulled me right in to watch it. Phenomenal acting, great cliffhangers, and very emotional near the end of the season! I REALLY hope the second season starts up soon!"
1688,Squid Game,"Had to push myself to watch beyond first 20 minutes. I watched trough and wanted to give it chance due to whole hype, but it is sad and horrible.Its not even about the violence, its just really really pointless and bad."
1689,Squid Game,"The fact that this was one of the most popular shows on Netflix speaks to me of just how far we've fallen as a society.I cannot imagine what kind of person would sit & slog through episode after episode of this convoluted, contrived drivel.I was loosing the will to live halfway through the second episode & I said to my mrs the second ""game"" had better be something spectacular to keep me from wanting to go into work 12 hours early,
So you can imagine my dumbfounded expression as I sat watching a dozen grown adults sit on the floor frantically licking biscuits.When it comes to entertainment anything would be better than this,
I'd get more satisfaction doing a tip run.How did this get made?Who payed for it?Why would you want to inflict this on people?It poses more questions than it answers."
1690,Squid Game,"Obviously the whole idea came to the mind of the writer by hearing the Joker (heath ledger) saying that famous line (When the chips are down, these civilized people will eat each other). Not so deep, but deep for people who hasn't explored real depth of life.The show is good in general yet doesn't deserve the hype.Watch it just for fun.Cheers!"
1691,Squid Game,"Acting 10/10
Story 10/10.I higly recommend this series."
1692,Squid Game,"The best show I've seen in years.....the characters are rich, the story is nuts, crazy, emotional, and brutally violent."
1693,Squid Game,"It's really similar to Battle Royale (book), or the movies Exam and Circle.I knew that 001 knows what's going on since the first episode. It was a mistake to give him the number 001. I thought he was the winner of a previous game, and he voted against the game at the beginning just to increase his chances (non-returning players).Huge mistake is to ""kill"" somebody when the camera is not showing them. (001 and the annoying woman both at the marble-game) Movie fans know the rule: If you don't see them die, they are not dead.Also at the marble game there was a plot hole, they could have win if the 2 players just swap bags. This way they both won the 10 marbles from their teammate, so they are both winning at the same time. (You don't have to own 20 marbles to win, the rule was just to win the marbles of your partner).In the last episode 001 says it was boring to watch these game he just wanted to play it - but there were documents from 1998 so he was bored for 20+ years? Interesting from a genius.I won't rewatch the series, but if there will be a second season, I'm in."
1694,Squid Game,"I enjoyed the show a lot but to be honest, if you were to randomly pick some American guys of the street, i think that they would've done a better job acting than the cast for the VIP:s - personally i would have rated Squid Game a 10/10 if it wasn't for them."
1695,Squid Game,I have an account for 10 years on IMDB but it will be my first review. I had to write it because I'm so angry at this stupid show.This show is so so so dumb and predictable. Already in the second episode I knew that this was the old guy plot to relive his younger days (the black and white footage) and that the last stand will be between those two colleagues. It was also very apparent that the brother of the policeman will be either one of the VIPs or the front man. 9 hours wastedThe show is only saved by the great acting.Never again.
1696,Squid Game,"First off: I didn't hate it...It started with a nice concept and execution until the parts of the lazy writing showed up:
* Of course, out of all the contestants, the end-game is a climax between the 2 childhood friends
* A lot of build up to the Front-man being (wait for it) Gun-ho's brother
* Who would have thought the old man was behind it? (Who didn't)And the VIPs were so poorly acted, it felt like some cut scene from some PS3 gameBottom line: fun to watch, but also fun to forget."
1697,Squid Game,"I watched all 9 episodes over 3 days. The 8th episode started to be somewhat dull and lacked the excitement of the others. However the 9th and final episode was a complete disaster and almost unwatchable. The 10 minute explanation of the games given by and old man was so painful and extremely boring to watch. There were so so many unanswered questions, very boring and uninspiring dialog and acting, no cliffhanger to make you not really care if there is another series."
1698,Squid Game,Best show to watch if you love AIB.Worth for a bingewatch. Thriller series lovers shouldn't miss.
1699,Squid Game,"I just dont get it, what is the new thing or new problem that it would solve!!! No thing new and the same idea with some expandings.Not accurate in so much details like the count of gamers or other things.IMDB is suffering from over rating these days."
1700,Squid Game,"I have watched a couple of Netflix shows, like Umbrella Academy, Stranger Things, Lupin and La Casa De Papel.But this show, is by far the best.I heard about this show by various pages throughout social media, and from a couple of friends, so I thought, lets give it a try.After the first episode, I was already in love with the show. The show is very bingeworthy.And man, what a great show this was, I hope after that ending a season 2 comes soon."
1701,Squid Game,"My god!! Where do i even start? The whole series was on another level. I don't know how they managed to make every single minute thrilling and entertaining. I was about to watch few episodes now and rest later then ended up watching the whole series on one day and oh boy the subs were horrible i can pretty much understand everything on korean so i watched few episodes without subs cuz of how bad the subs were. Other than that another masterpiece by koreans, loved it from start to end."
1702,Squid Game,"It's nail biting the entire time and I'm the end you don't get to see who the VIPs are, you don't get to see the one VIP explain what it is, you don't get to see anything the police officer gathered, you don't know how the police officers brother became the front man, he tries to save a man that killed all of his friends in the end, the old guy doesn't ever get to the point in what he's saying to the point where it's frustrating, and he never goes to see his kid with all the money. He did help the girls little brother though that's the only good thing about the end."
1703,Squid Game,"Squid Game is an enjoyable and visually pleasing show, but it's definitely not a ""good"" show. It's no different from any other generic thriller made by C-grade directors who never made a movie with a score higher than 6. Being a true follower of this genre, Squid Game made most of the same mistakes such movies usually make: too many plot holes, illogical and poorly thought out scenes, unfairly manipulating people's emotions for shock value, etc. However, the show manages to do one thing most other ""bad"" movies never accomplished, and that's shamelessly manipulate the viewer's emotions for cheap tear-jerking moments, that despite being unbelievably predictable (such as most things in this movie), still manage to affect many people.To be fair, I was actually quite surprised when I found out that the director/writer of the show, Hwang Dong-hyuk, presumably worked on this script for years. It looks like something an inexperienced film-maker who never attended a filmmaking school would make. It seems like he simply took bits he liked and that worked well in other movies, and decided to combine them into one tv show. The thing is, this constant jump from one bit to another, stripped the show from any meaning. It's an extremely superficial show which tries very hard to be deeper than it is. Though I wouldn't hold it against this show, even though it makes me laugh whenever the director is mad when someone is criticizing his talentless piece of work.With that being said, there's nothing wrong about it not being a good show as long as it's enjoyable, and it definitely is. The difference is that despite liking it, I won't put it among the good movies I like, but rather with the other bunch, where you can find movies such as the Saw and various action-driven movies - bad but fun."
1704,Squid Game,"The biggest feat of this show was the amazing cinematography and the atmosphere it created. From the depressing streets of urban Seoul and poor living quarters to the colorful staircases and luxurious decors of the 'game quarters', every detail in every scene creates a certain mood and fits in perfectly.The acting was a little inconsistent, while many of the lead actors were fantastic, some of the actors that got less screentime were well below their level. But as I said they got less screentime, thus the impact stays very limited to the series as a whole.As for the plot and its subplots, it is nothing completely new or unseen but certain elements to it make it an unique experience anyway. Even when the outcome and some of the twists were predictable they were still enjoying to watch, just because of the execution. Nonetheless the show still manages to surprise the viewer from time to time.Overall I really enjoyed the experience despite its minor flaws, it still manages to be a extremely tense, beautiful and intriguing show. It is for that reason that I am very curious to see how (or if?) the writers will continue after the open ending of the first season."
1705,Squid Game,Every thing is perfect on this series.Can not wait for season 2.Koran keep it up.
1706,Squid Game,"I didn't anticipate getting so invested. The beginning of the series was slow for me, still interesting enough that I continued watching. After about the 3rd game, I was hooked. I love this show. The old man and North Korean girl are gems."
1707,Squid Game,"Korean Hunger Games with better acting and much more relatable themes. The plot allegory focuses on the rampant exploitation of poor and desperate people, with the initial invitation to play the game and everything that follows appealing to their need to clear debts. This soon becomes about something much bigger and darker. Not for the squeamish.No spoilers, but I will say I'm a vehement anti-binger when it comes to my viewing habits. In the 10-odd hour runtime of this series, though, I stopped only to sleep and make a chicken wrap."
1708,Squid Game,"This tv series is so entertaining. I couldn't switch it off, it hit every emotion from shock, tears and wow.A must watch if like gripping tv shows."
1709,Squid Game,"Didn't like the main character, a lot of annoying characters also, I can't believe Koreans behave like this. Had some good scenes but overall it is overrated, ended badly and didn't make me feel they put a lot of work on this. Expected better for 8.3 stars."
1710,Squid Game,Nothing short of perfection. Lee Jung Jae is sensational. A lot of thought into this season here's hoping for a season 2 . Love it. Characters development is perfect.
1711,Squid Game,"Squid Game tells an intriguing story and is very compelling. It is somewhat disturbing, brutal and fantastical in its storytelling of the class divide in society. Nevertheless, once you start watching you won't be able to stop. Most of the episodes are fantastic and really draw you into the story. The character development and story arcs are pretty solid, and the acting is phenomenal. I was also blown away by the set design, costumes and overall aesthetic. However, there is some plot points that I was not overly fond of. One being the whole organ harvesting side story. I understand that this was here to highlight there was an intruder amongst them but for me it just distracted from the story and overall aesthetic of the show. Another was the 'twist' that Il Nam was behind the whole thing. I could see this a mile off but hoped that because the show had been clever so far it wouldn't fall into this trap. I was left feeling a bit deflated by the scene with him and Seong Gi-Hun at the end. There are also some plot holes that are somewhat frustrating. Like how was Il Nam phoning the Front Man to check in. Especially when some of the other contestants were staying awake all night. Also, when the Front Man goes to check out the washed-up body and finds his brother's badge. Wouldn't he have known that the body was not his brother? Still he goes back to the island like the issue had been handled. I do think that the show could have benefitted from maybe being 10 episodes as the last three feel somewhat rushed and different tonally from the rest of the show. I am also slightly frustrated that we did not find out more about the Front Man, this side of the story is somewhat lacking. I know a lot of people have taken issue with the VIPs acting. However, this did not bother me as it just added to the obnoxious and disgusting personality of these characters. Finally, you will be mystified by Seong Gi-Hun's hairstyle choice at the end, but I believe it is him trying 'start fresh' or trying to take back control of himself after what happened. Kind of like when people get crazy hairstyles after a bad breakup. You will definitely be frustrated by Sae-Byoek's death but again for me it just highlighted that none of the characters, no matter how badass, were in control of what was going to happen. Lastly, you may be annoyed by Seong Gi-Hun's final decision to not get on the plane. However, I think this is showing that he is no longer going to just sit by and watch bad things happen to other people. This is a narrative of his character throughout. We know that he has PTSD from the riots during the protest at his work. Where he sat by and watched someone get killed and again with the drunk guy on the street in the final episode. He could have gone down and helped the guy, but he didn't or maybe the show is just saying that people don't change. Seong Gi-Hun is impulsive. Whatever the reason it is a great Segway for the next season."
1712,Squid Game,One of the best series i've whatched in a long time.
1713,Squid Game,So boring. Try to be cool but no brain to do.Boring plot. Boring writer.Too drama. No fun. Nothing interesting.All can be is some series that just play and do something else.
1714,Squid Game,Many parts were predictable but still there were factors increasing curiosity. Won't add which parts were predictable cause I want this spoiler free.The acting by main chars was excellent.
1715,Squid Game,"Terrible acting, the main idea of the plot is used very much, copy of trends (full body uniforms and masks). I would be much better if it was just a movie. I really don't understand why all this noise globally for this series. Maybe it's the splatter that new age likes?"
1716,Squid Game,"Culminated Visually examining Famous Korean Web series #SquidGame What a great Series Absolutely Doted This. It tells the story of people who have Their Quandaries And how they fight to dispense it. It tells us about the value of mazuma and to what caliber can a man go to procure it. It shows us that their are no authentic friends, affinities when it comes to your own survival. We all find ways to push every obstruction that comes in our way. It's about apostasy , Obsession and hunger of acquiring victory.Overall this series was great filled with human emotions, our day to day quandaries. Their are some genuinely fascinating games that one plays to earn mazuma. It tells us the consequentiality of mazuma and Expounds the Law of marginal Utility. It shows us our lives have become vapid by this conventional routine. We require to Keep the child inside us alive. Background score Music everything was Superb integrating intensity to scenes. Episode 6 was too good and emotional. Season 2 Is Coming Can't Wait. The Short Comeo of Gong Yoo Was treat to visually examine. Must Watch, You'll dote it."
1717,Squid Game,"Overall I've loved the concept and how they've filmed this series, but ending/The continuation plot (last episode of season 1) is crucial for any series and they've failed in that last episode as per my expectation, Not too sure whether the second episode will be interesting as the first one!"
1718,Squid Game,"Oh God! I started watching this because of all the hype amongst my peers and on the internet, and I never thought it would turn up like this.Humanity has been fading away and we are monsters masquerading as civilized persons living in this dystopian society.Watch it on your own risk, and if you're too sensitive or under 18, stay the hell away from it."
1719,Squid Game,"One of the amazing series I have ever watched, day after day the Korean drama proves to be the best. If you are feeling bored because of repetitive ideas of Hollywood drama just watch Squid Game, the idea is just fresh in the packet, the actors are very capable, even the music is perfect. You can't just simply ignore the next episode, it is like addiction you will continue to watch🤗"
1720,Squid Game,Really cared about these characters. It really made me attached to this movie. Great storytelling!
1721,Squid Game,"There are a lot better shows out there, doesn't worth the hype. Shows only massacre, no proper story line."
1722,Squid Game,The details are in every scene. Wish to see another season.
1723,Squid Game,"It was trying too hard to be artsy at times which resulted in it being boring in spots. Majority of it was predictable. My main issue was the reasoning behind all of the games. Yes, they are all in debt and need things paid off. Fair. So what is the reasoning for the mastermind to make all these people play games? He wanted to just have fun. This is lumped in with all the stupid reasons anime shows happen. Because of boredom or they just want to have fun/make things interesting. LAZY."
1724,Squid Game,"The story was unpredictable.Strong character.Little bit gore.There is betrayal, sacrifice, strategy, greed, everything is on this film.Seriously you have to watch this before you die."
1725,Squid Game,The Best Web Series Ever One Of The Best Series Of The WorLd No 1 this series show world real face must and best experience in my life .................................
1726,Squid Game,"Amazing acting by the main actors and side characters. VIPs were the only annoying part of the movie but they did their part. Music was a bit annoying at times but it gave a lot of it tension that was really needed in all of the ""games"". The ending is incredible and I don't think there should be a season 2. I would love to see more tho. I feel like they didn't really think the show itself is going to get really popular so they ended it right there.9/10 only thing that was bad were the VIPs. Would love to see more with the VIP plot etc."
1727,Squid Game,"The movie started with great plots and provided great anticipation for viewer like me. It keeps your mind thinking what's the game coming next.However everything went south when the VIP appeared.. the movie added some low b-graded westerners with psycho minded which I don't see the connection at all. When they were ushered to the room with naked body paintings, the scenes were so disconnected.Apart from the above, this is a great movie."
1728,Squid Game,"Started great. Beautiful scenery, surprising, promising. Then came E7 (VIP's)...the worst writing, directing and acting ever! Episodes 8 and 9 are nothing more than a bunch of cliches.Six episodes 10 points each. The last three no more than 1 point. Makes 7 points in total, but never before I watched something that went downhill so badly. If there is a 2nd season, I'll pass."
1729,Squid Game,"I watched the show because it was trending and I couldn't stop until I finished it. The idea behind the show is close to Hunger Games or Battle Royale, it's about a game where people die and there is friendship and betrayal, even if you watched hunger games and battle royale this is still new and a very beautiful show that is set apart.The progression of the characters was beautiful, the acting was very good some say the VIP acting and dialog was bad, I didn't like it either but I think the dialog was meant to be stupid and cheezy like real psychopath rich people would have, it's like a separation from normal people and rich people with a sick mind, so if the VIP disturbed you I think that was the director's plan.The show is pleasing to the eye and ears, even if the players were locked in a place every game was in a different setting and was beautifully designed, the tense music during the games makes you anxious, idk... just watch it already !!!"
1730,Squid Game,Watch ep 6 and then u will understand why this series is so famous.
1731,Squid Game,"Squid game doesn't deserve half the hype it's getting. As someone who's easily satisfied, the plot is totally off, the actions certain characters decide to make and the whole ""fictional realism"" is mediocre at best.On the other hand, the visuals, colors and camerawork in general is amazing."
1732,Squid Game,"There are people who have watched this series and are happy with it because it entertained them. But we are a few who have seen how many opportunities they have left behind. They could have brought a lot more out of it, instead of a grotesque mindless murdering."
1733,Squid Game,"Maybe it's because I don't speak Korean and the translation is awful, but I heavily rely on IMDB to dictate the shows that I watch... having said that I cannot understand the hype around this show, I find it painful to watch and this isn't a new concept - games that involve brutally killing people... anyway I'm half way through and purely only watching because I don't want to be ""that guy"" that hasn't seen the infamous ""squid game"". But christ on a cracker... its not THAT good."
1734,Squid Game,"Great story, great acting, not giving it a 10 because of the VIPs.Love Korean movies/series (Check out the movie 'Old Boy')"
1735,Squid Game,"The last thing people in a world afflicted by so many conflicts is a show that boast nothing but violence to the extreme. I stopped watching after the 1st episode.No content whatsoever. Just disgraceful violence. My suggestion: Watch The Crown, The Queen's Gambit, Unorthodox, Ozark. Even Breaking Bad. Something they will make you think. Squid Game is bad content to the soul, to the mind. And what amazes me is that the whole world has become addicted to this brutal unnecessary bloodshed. World's gone crazy."
1736,Squid Game,"If the vips were done with Korean actors, or at least some people who know how to read off a script, this would be a 10/10 show. In episode 7, the VIPs are front and center, so that inevitably makes it the worst episode by far. This frustrates me even more, because this show was so close to being perfect. Hope the 2nd season (if they decide to make another) will fix these issues."
1737,Squid Game,"No, it's not fun to watch
No, it is not entertaining
It is disgusting for the mindAll the crap with awful, silly high school acting.What did they achieve with this? Views? Big deal.Learning something? The opposite..."
1738,Squid Game,"Just watched whole 9 episodes and my favorite was the 6th, Gganbu. Not perfect nor a masterpiece, but this is very well made and provides a certain level of emotional experience. The overall show was far beyond things that were shown in trailer. Very well directed, performed, and finding its own unique points from the genre mixture of various references such as Gambling Apocalypse : Kaiji, Battle Royale, and so on. Just hope all others enjoy this show not only in Korea but also everywhere!Ps. Even to Korean ears, VIPs' English conversations were not well written nor performed. I think the drama could stand well enough without their presence and save the budget."
1739,Squid Game,"With a very well-structured scenario, which combines in a thrilling way the emotion with the decisions, as if to translate them from real life into a tough game that wants nothing more than to highlight the decisions we each make in our daily lives. Daily and which cannot be erased like this without a sacrifice, sometimes supreme: one's own life."
1740,Squid Game,"I know the idea behind the show is messed up and cruel... But what isn't nowadays? I don't know about y'all, but I genuinely enjoyed the series. The acting is really good with well known actors and actresses. It's a very slow-paced show, which sucks, but overall I truly enjoyed it through and through......until the end. They could've done better. The moral/message behind the ending has a deep meaning, but otherwise, I didn't like the ending all that much.It did seem like they left it open for a second season. Fingers crossed, because I'll be watching! 🤞"
1741,Squid Game,"It has an interesting concept and the execution of the games and the layout was fun to watch, but it was annoyingly predictable and many plot holes were left after it ended. I don't understand the hype around this. It's fun to watch, but not worth more than 5 stars. The last 2 or 3 episodes created more questions than answers and just ruined it overall for me."
1742,Squid Game,"The show is great, well worth a watch. Fantastic concept, brilliantly executed with some stellar acting and directing.But the English dub is.. laughably bad. The show drops from an 8/10 to a generous 5/10 when you watch it on the dub.Ignoring the atrocious acting from the English side of Squid Game, as soon as you switch it back to Korean, it instantly turn back into a beautiful piece of television, appealing to anyone aged 14 or over.An expert on cinema, or a bored Netflix subscriber with nothing else to do; both will enjoy it equally as this is one of the best shows Netflix has released. I would definitely recommend watching. It has some thrilling twists, fabulous performances from the Korean actors, and overall a great story. If you haven't yet - watch Squid Game. And watch it the way it was intended..."
1743,Squid Game,"Not worth the advertisement. Poor plot , poor game plan, unnecessary violence . Not worth watching.This looks completely overhyped. The storyline and plot are very weakHowever artists are good. They have tried to do good job. Most of them sounded natural."
1744,Squid Game,"Since this show was so big, I'd like to explain my opinions on how this show is over criticized for no reason.Something I hear a lot is the ending being bad, and sure with a spot of bad acting, and strange plot developments it definitely makes it an imperfect show.On the other hand, suspense and action is so meticulously crafted within the first three quarters of the show, It should be considered very good if not great.Problem: It became mainstream.Basically, if this show didn't become so mainstream and large, it would have a better rating and reviewer base on here, but since all the ignorant people who want to be different to the crowd nit-picked the tiniest inconsistencies in the show, it's been down rated.TL;DR, It's a great show, but since too many people watched it and memed about it, 'quirky' and 'different' people decided to criticize it for small reasons. You praise your unknown and pretty bad shows and give them above 8.2s, but won't give an incredibly well made suspense masterpiece anything more than an 8.Dumb."
1745,Squid Game,"For me, an overrated series.The idea and the theme are good.The acting is weak.The dialogues are boring and unnecessarily long.Jung Hoyeon was the only actress who convinced me."
1746,Squid Game,"Waste of time. Don't watch it. Rather go outside or you can take a nice nap, relax. Anything is better than this. I'm actually sorry that I boosted the show."
1747,Squid Game,This is a boring series i really dont understand why it is so popular. Adults playing childrens games but they die if they fail... it dont even sound like a good idea.
1748,Squid Game,"Extremely bad acting (including the amazing VIP characters - WTF was that?), predictable ending and scenes that dragged on for too long. There is no character development and your don't feel connected to them or their dramas."
1749,Squid Game,"Good show,few great episode & absolutely rubbish ending."
1750,Squid Game,"""Everything becomes boring after a point"" The goal is not to make lot of money but after making lots n lots is not to get bore while enjoying the material things."
1751,Squid Game,"This show is great so far. It has a cool mystery and style BUT the reason I believe it's so popular is because of its anime style concept. This show has an outlandish concept style that isn't popular in typical American media but is very popular in anime. I believe this show is so popular because everyone who loves anime likes the show. Not just that but those who have never seen anime because of stigma but would enjoy the medium LOVE this show because it's the first thing they have seen like it. Everyone is raving about this show because they have never seen anything like it (except for us anime watchers). I believe this show's popularity represents a huge shift in entertainment. I think this will be a gateway for it's fans into other non-American entertainment forms, most specifically anime."
1752,Squid Game,"This show provided some quick binge-worthy entertainment but is incredibly overrated. Some of the dramatic moments (especially deaths) in the storyline feel so incredibly cliché and poorly written it is hard to feel any surprise/ sadness but instead just boredom.The concept of course is interesting, but the whole ""games to entertain rich people"" concept has been played out in better ways before.Nonetheless, the actors (except the VIPs) are good to great and the artistic direction is awesome."
1753,Squid Game,"Really a great show with great concept. Every death scene has its own logical situation, great cinematic shots and good story everyone should watch it. Literally Don't listen to those people who are calling this series overrated. Those people are burning because of the overhypeness of this series.must watch series."
1754,Squid Game,This is an Over acted and stupid show. You just don't care about the characters and it's all over the place. Also this is a re ash of so many other movies and nothing original. Finally the English translation voice over is just horrible.
1755,Squid Game,"SQUID GAME IS ONE OF THE GREATEST WEB SERIES IN THE WORLD. THIS WEB SERIES IS INCREDIBLE & LEGENDARY. ALL OF YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS ONCE. LITERALLY ALL THE EPISODES ARE BEST OF THE BEST. YOU WILL GET EMOTIONAL,THRILLED,EXCITED & BREATHE TAKING AT THE SAME TIME.IT'S A TOTAL FASCINATION. I AM OBSESSED IN IT. I AM WATCHING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. ALL THE ACTORS & ACTRESS WERE AMAZING.ACTUALLY ""LEE JUNG-JAE"" HIS ACTING WAS TOO REALISTIC. IT WAS THE BEST CHARACTER. INFINITE SALUTE TO THE DIRECTOR ""HWANG DONG-HYUK"" FOR GIVING US THIS OUTSTANDING WEB SERIES. THE ENDING OF SQUID GAME IS VERY TWISTING & ASTOUNDING.OF COURSE THE BACKGROUND MUSIC WAS TOO MUCH THRILLING.""HONEY COMB"" PART WILL BE MEMORABLE FOREVER. ON THE OTHER SIDE ""GGANBU"" PART WAS TOO MUCH EMOTIONAL & PAINFUL.SO, GUYS WATCH SQUID GAME ONCE BEFORE YOU DIE.WAITING FOR ""SQUID GAME: SEASON 2""... ... ..."
1756,Squid Game,This show is very overrated. Had to push through the series not binge-worthy at all. The whole storyline is predictable and I'm entertaining since nothing is actually surprising in the plot. Really don't understand the hype. The only entertaining part are watching how elegant the games are put together and the shots of them dying are very well done.
1757,Squid Game,"Here is why we wanted to say about Squid Game. I miss movies and shows like this. We haven't had anything similar for awhile. I thought the character development was top notch. I seriously cared about 8 characters. This made it fun because I had no idea who would die or win. All of the characters are flawed. There wasn't a typical hero or someone you really hated and I loved that. The acting was really really good for several characters. The directing and writing was really good. It was exciting and fun with lots of twists and turns. The concept was pretty cool and you could do sequels and it would be just as fun as long as you can find more actors as great as these. If you enjoyed the Hunger Games you will probably really like this series. My husband said it was a cross between Saw, Hunger Games and the minions (only for the outfits). I haven't seen Saw and don't like torture, but I enjoyed this. However, if you are not cool with lots of people dying you might think it's too much. Also, we all binged the season in two days and are still like wait a minute? I was thinking about this and wow, is this what really happened? Enjoy!"
1758,Squid Game,No doubt it is a one of the Best web Series. I recommend everyone to watch this.
1759,Squid Game,.... And it'll do its job. The games gave me anxiety and goosebumps. Definitely worth watching a few episodes at a time.
1760,Squid Game,"It's visually appealing, and I can get past the bad acting, but the broken storylines are enough to ruin it for me. Wouldn't watch it again and wouldn't recommend."
1761,Squid Game,Good plot but could have been wrapped up in half the episodes. Some of the acting is atrocious. Just don't understand these ratings.
1762,Squid Game,The worst acting in the history of TV/film.Just plain awful. I would rather eat a 2 metre mound of dog excrement than sit through another ep of this tripe.
1763,Squid Game,"The title of the movie is a little strange, but it is not surprising cuz most Korean movies have weird titles. However, it is quite entertaining, immersive, and highly addictive. Is season 2 going to be an octopus game?"
1764,Squid Game,"What a brilliant show, keeps you on the edge & delivers one last unexpected blow towards to the end! Everything perfect, except the obnoxious portrayal of the western VIP's! Had that been replaced by Korean actors, it would've been 10/10! Well done, Netflix!"
1765,Squid Game,To be honest I loved this series. The littoe details were awesome and the whole idea is really clever. This series made me laugh and cry. I don't normally like series like this but this was just amazing masterpiece with many plotwists. The best series that I have watched for a while. I recommend this to you all.
1766,Squid Game,"A series that combines artistic creativity, visual creativity, and genius in the acting performances of the heroes of the work, which rises to be the best series I have watched produced by Netflix, despite the dark side of the story. I also can not forget the creativity in choosing classical music and slow songs that calm the soul in sharp and violent scenes, which gives a wonderful taste in that mixture."
1767,Squid Game,"Enjoyed the show, the sets, and they did a wonderful job developing each character. One major story line was not touched upon afterwards and completely left you hanging. A bit disappointing."
1768,Squid Game,This web series shows the real portrayed of human beings..
1769,Squid Game,I was a little bit depressed after watching squid game the same feeling I had after playing a violent video game.I would not play the squid game no matter how big the price is because I know I have zero chance to win and 100% chance to die.But I do want to get a green seater with #456 for my Halloween costume.
1770,Squid Game,"The fact that Squid Game is the #1 series in the World right now helps explain a lot when it comes to the fact that everyone seems to be mentally disturbed these days.Interesting and fast-paced series, yes. But VERY disturbing."
1771,Squid Game,"Squid Game tries to be a somewhat psychological thriller at its end but missteps horribly. It fails to go past the superficial psychological layer it tries to breach. People killing each other for money? What's new? Blood and gore? Yawn! Goofy costumes? Laughs in Money Heist. Plot Holes? By the Dozen. The games are not even remotely amusing bar one or two of them. The elimination process is literally the only thing that made me look at the screen occasionally. Let's not even get started on the acting. From the get go, Squid Game fails to take shape and morphs into whatever the director wanted as it went on.The fact that this show is the talk of the town is a sign of the times. Netflix shows besting other TV shows in the market but definitely not in quality. I really hope this isn't where mainstream TV is heading."
1772,Squid Game,"The timeline of Ep. 6- Gganbu and Ep. 7-VIP did not match. By the time VIPs arrive, the old man was killed playing marbles. In the last episode its revealed that old man wants to play and not host. Play what? He's already ""dead"" for the participants.Anyway, first couple of episodes were good and at multiple times the scenes were over stretched. Many elements and much of the build up was left hanging. The cop who chased the perpetrators the whole time, dies inconsequentially. No follow up on the messages sent to the cops (he even talked with his chief).Perhaps, the English translation and subtitles failed to deliver the story in true essence and that's why emotions and behaviors seemed unjustified."
1773,Squid Game,"This series really gave me goosebumps, thrill, and emotional attachment for the first 5-6 episodes (4th game), then the VIPs come and boom, what's going on?The worst part of this series is the VIPs. Idk why would they cast these foreigners. Their scripts and acting is soooo annoying, exaggerated, and their roles and existence?? So unnecessary. Every dialogs from their side are so cringy, and it hurts my ears. Their acting skills made want to skip the whole series or just fastforward it.Then the police. I was so excited whenever I see the police in actions. But the conclusion? Hus fate? Damn it was so disappointing, like all the struggles he went through means nothings. There was no clarity of his fate, and I can only assume that all the recordings and proof were not sent at all as the game still continue a year after and no further investigation were mentioned.5th game and 6th game, the VIPs came for the most exciting game of all. But what? Both were so boring and there was no thrill or emotional attachment like the previous 4 games.The conflict between gu han and sang woo. The hell? It was so rushed! Just after 1 game, and the relationship broke just like that and they decided to kill each other? And why suddenly sang woo decided to kill himself after the last 5th game he didnt feel remorse or guilt to the people he sacrificed???After gu han, who won all games by luck, he decided to did nothing with his money, even to the point he did not help Sae Byeok's lil bro, Sang Woo's mother, and especially reclaim his daughter until a year the game ended??? What was that all about?? And just when he finally decided to meet his daughter, he decided to get back to the game, in which he won all pure by luck? (Except for 2nd game)Plot twist was so predictable as well.Couldve given a much lower stars, but the korean actors did well with their acting, and the first half of the season was still satisfying."
1774,Squid Game,"I do not know why people like this series, of course, there are different tastes. But in my opinion, this series is not worth watching for various reasons: repetitive theme - very weak actors - slow process - nonsense dialogues and ..."
1775,Squid Game,It was so intresting that i finished all in 1 day.
1776,Squid Game,"So overhyped. The games were good, don't get me wrong, but literally everything else was awful. Dialogue boring, it dragged so much. Pointless and predictable storylines, lots wrong with it. Honestly couldn't wait til it ended. And even the ending annoyed me."
1777,Squid Game,Just an owesome web series....lots of love from india keep it up guys.....waiting for second season.I love background music also....every character has beutiful role in this web series.
1778,Squid Game,"What makes Squid Game different from other dramas within the ""deadly games"" genre:1) The games are simple and easy to understand. If I were in Kakegurui or Liar Game, I wouldn't even fully understand the rules of the games, much less thing of an ingenious plan that takes advantage of god knows what loophole.2) The characters and situations are realistic. There is no cartoonish trope. They all behave like normal, average people, while still having their own unique personalities.3) There is no mastermind player with IQ 3000 who is always 11 steps ahead of the other characters.4) The characters chose to be part of the game even after its cruelty was unraveled, making it all the more disturbing.5) It put South Korea as a country in a bad light. I was shocked when Sae-Byeok basically said the South is not that much better than the North.My only complaint is that Squid Game doesn't escape the ""kill all the main characters except for the protagonist"" trope present in other k-dramas such as Sweet Home. Also, I feel like they could've expanded more on the relationship between Sae-Byeok and Ji-Yeong, building more on it before it all came crumbling to dust."
1779,Squid Game,"Well, this is just a Korean Hype. Japanese thriller like As A Gods Will, Alice in Borderland, Battle Royale 1&2 are better than this."
1780,Squid Game,"Is it realistic? This game invented in 1988. Every year so many people disappear and their body never found. Why is the police thinks main role is like crazy dude. And the banks is a joke? So much potholes and predictable dialogues, actions. Meaningless deaths who bet on the who can shape their candy without break."
1781,Squid Game,There are a bunch of much older Japanese dramas & films of this genre (survival games) that are far superior but less popular. Talk about marketing and promotion...
1782,Squid Game,"This was one of the best kdramas i've watched on netflix! The storyline, the actors, the acting, it was wonderful. I've never rushed to finish a series before like i did with this one!"
1783,Squid Game,"From start to finish, it was more predictable than a 1990s slasher...yes there were vibrant colors, yes it was in a foreign language, yea there was female empowerment. All the things that make up an academy award winner, right? An overrated, overhyped spin on an old story and a told in a sub par way in a different language..."
1784,Squid Game,"Amazing show, even the background characters had great acting- but the VIPs, I hope they don't return again for Season two because their acting was rubbish!"
1785,Squid Game,"I would give it a 10 if it weren't for the terrible performance of the VIPs! It killed the vibe. Other than that, every actor or actress gave the performance of a lifetime, costumes are beautiful and well made, and the detail in each scene is fabulous!!!"
1786,Squid Game,"Every character makes you emotional
What a story bro my favorite is 6th episode. This webseries is real threat of real like dark World.This webseries is giving you goosebumps."
1787,Squid Game,"The Escher sets and the island hideaway that could have come from the Pinewood 007 stage are memorable but the programme is sunk by ithe moral vacuum at its core.SPOILERS ABOUND BELOW
Hundreds are despatched as so much deadwood so that we can have meaningful encounters with those granted speaking parts and they in turn dutifully expire so that the supposedly morally conflicted main character can feel a bit upset and buy off his complicity in the slaughter by chucking shedloads of his winnings at the sole dependent of one of the 400+ victims. Yes, he does look morose and affects appropriate hair growth to the point where he really must be saddened by the whole unpleasantness and even goes as far as having a salon dye his hair red (and do a terrible job at the rear - if you take away anything from this drama it is to ensure you get them to use a mirror to show you the back if you visit a barber in Korea).The contortions of probability required to support the reveal of the old man as the kingpin of the enterprise point to a rethinking of the physical world more radical than that proposed by Einstein and the logistics and financing of the operation are underpinned by no more than the fact that someone conceived of them in an idle moment and never troubled themselves to give it a second thought.The second series is a slam dunk but I'll follow the example of the few who chose not to return to the game - life outside may not always be a bed of roses but returning to the unpleasant stench of this narrative is a far worse proposition."
1788,Squid Game,"I think I am not the one who didn't like the cringiests characters in netflix called the ""VIPS"" and that ruins so bad the tv show, also the end isn't satisfactory as it could be imo."
1789,Squid Game,"The series started off with a bang and it just hooked me from the very starting 1st episode and I binge-watched the whole show in 1 day.IT'S ENGAGING,VISUALLY IMPRESSIVE AND THE CHARECTERIZATION OF THE PLAYERS WERE ASLO GOOD. Though it's not a masterpiece but it's an unique take on this interesting concept. AND, ALSO I loved the CLIMAX TWIST.WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ALL OF YOU GUYS!!"
1790,Squid Game,"I don't care a lot about the games. The important part of the show for me is everything behind them: what caused them to create the games and why, who they are, etc. Regarding that, the finale exceeded my expectations and the entire first season was perfect (considering that they would do a sequel). Some people say VIP acting ruined it all. Important: you should stop watching dubbed and writing reviews. It wasn't made for english speakers, so they spoke in a generic and slow way. It's part of the plot.I didn't find any plot holes, inconsistencies or general negative points about it. If not for some very annoying characters, but it's a part of the narrative and I usually don't have a problem with it. I just get very happy when they die xD."
1791,Squid Game,"Nobody believes in themselves.More precisely, no actor seems to ever get out of their own head. Makes you wonder if it's all Korean actors, or just these particular Korean actors, who've never learned the art of losing themselves in their character. Every word, movement, expression is a reminder that you're watching actors in costumes on a set reciting lines in front of a camera.My suggestion: get a hold of the script and read it. In this way, I'm thinking, the story might have a chance to come alive-as something more than a series of sketches put on by a bunch of clowns."
1792,Squid Game,"When I saw this show and its tasks i thought myself doing that task, This Show is awesome everybody should watch this, i scared of only two tasks, 1. Tug Of War, 2. Glass Stepping Bridge, when people slipped down in tug of war, i thought i slipped and my heart stopped working, Same as with bridge task too, in this i thought i'm a participant in this game and i slipped off, What an amazing an great show. Love from India."
1793,Squid Game,"One of the best shows I've ever watched, I hate the VIPs though."
1794,Squid Game,"Wow what a show! I watched with my fiance who also hates dubbed over films, it's too distracting, HOWEVER, Squid Game is SO worth it!! I'd even watch it again. The emotions coming from each character made it easy to connect w/ them even they're speaking another language. I was on the edge of my seat the entire series. I originally thought this show was going to be super corny...boy was I wrong!!! Great show."
1795,Squid Game,I couldn't wait to get to episode 8 and stop watching this. I'm a massive fan of S. Korean movies but this was a damp squid (geddit?). Lamely predictable with no tension just excuses to kill people. As if the police intruder would have had the freedom to go and do what he liked. If there's a series 2 (unlikely) I'm not watching. If this is 8.3 then Oldboy is the other side of 20. Very disappointing.
1796,Squid Game,"Spoilers ahead. Superb acting, and that's all. Well, it was kind of thrilling up to episode 8. The last episode was very disapointing and spoiled the whole series. If you are older and have already seen a lot of movies, then there is nothing new for you here. It is a combination of Saw (2004) and Bet Your Life (2004), among some old moral dilemmas. Save your time."
1797,Squid Game,This is the bad ass show and is the best tv show i have ever seen i did not really like Ep 3 but everything else ws perfect you show 100% watch this show is a full of fun and showed be watched by everyone.
1798,Squid Game,"Things I liked: great concept, colorful cast, beautiful cinematography, true untill the very end to the Korean sentimentalism and cinematic metaphors.Things I didn't liked: the music was great but repetitive. The VIPs were awful, looked like the most cheap B rated movie actors.Overall 9 stars from 10 and looking forward to Season 2. Hope they will not ruin the concept and the stilished way of dealing with socially conscious themes."
1799,Squid Game,Good The thing is they are stretching It out. Story and all things are good but The concept if a new one in the web series world.
1800,Squid Game,"You can't compare this show to Battle Royale, Saw, Kill Bill, Hostel, Hunger Games. No way.READ ON.Hunger Games - which was made so cheesy, even the name 'Katnis Evergreen' is so Cringey for the genre is NOTHING like Squid Game. I learn nothing from Hunger Games and the acting/emotions of the characters are not believable. The contestants are too polished without any flair to project a torturous situation - mental and physical. The whole picture is a clown fest and the moment the contestants are unleashed to battle for survival, the show turned from boring to purposeless. I felt nothing from the show. Other brutal shows above are all about senseless killings too. If at all comparing the above shows, Squid Game is perhaps closest to Saw, of which the latter has quite an interesting concept but still boring.Does not mean you release a film about plane crash, you own the genre. SQUID GAME is an ORIGINAL survival show and Hollywood just have to admit it.Also, SQUID GAME is at a complete different skill level, in terms of performance and writing. The character development is genius, and the planting of clues and planned coincidences is mind blowing. The gore is just secondary, and the whole heart of the show is completely something else - next level entertainment.Watching this show inspires me to be compassionate, and I am not inspired at all by the violence. Those who wishes not to see the show just because it's rated to include violent scenes, will just be at loss."
1801,Squid Game,"I've got high expectations towards this, because of the tsunami of memes - every still of this IS highly memeable - but ultimately it was a bit of a letdown. The overall feel is a decent mixture of a dozen movies from Stone's Any Given Sunday to Hitoshi Matsumoto's Symbol to Hunger Games to Train to Busan, to Truman Show to Shaolin Soccer to Midsommar etc... but it manages to feel exotic and somewhat unique - partly because of the language. The acting is superb, the production profesh, the design amazing, but ultimately nothing new, nothing original and the overall strength is in the details. As a whole, it fails to truly deliver, weak and shallow for true connoisseurs, and far more entry level than the tons of rave reviews suggest. Actually forgettable."
1802,Squid Game,"Stupidest, ugliest, meaningless garbage. No story, no motivation, ultra unrealistic, no one in the world would ever act even close in the same situations. How can something like this be rated so high??? What is wrong with you peole, you were under hynosis?"
1803,Squid Game,I fast forwarded it after episode 4. Didn't have the time and energy to go through each and every boring scene of this show just to know the ending. Shouldn't have listened to my friend whi said its a great show.
1804,Squid Game,I would never thought that a show could blow my mind that much its really deep and also very dark i recommend it for everyone with a strong mind. One of the best shows ever.
1805,Squid Game,"This has only blood bath, so rich people for their time pass kills 100s of poor people and they enjoy it? Seriously? This is vey disturbing, I watched 1st 3/4 episodes then the last one directly to see what happened at the end. This jst waste of time showing cruelty.People are already having so many problems in real life, they watch shows for entertainment, to forget their stress and problem for sometime, but this show will make someone more depressed."
1806,Squid Game,"Up to Episode 6 This show was near perfect, every aspect of it was extremely enjoyable, the pacing kept you hooked while not making everything feel unnatural, the acting was realistic and everyone really stayed true to their character, the filming was really enjoyable and it gave you a great way to see stuff, then with episode 7, they introduced american vips, now don't get me wrong they definitely didn't have good acting, but i will give them credit for really being emotionless and portraying what kind of people they are supposed to be, plus they didn't take much from the plot so i didn't care too much for them, and finally the 5th game on the 7th episode was arguably my favorite, so i enjoyed that too, episode 8 wasn't bad in terms of anything but plotting, you follow up with the cop the entire show just for him to be killed by his brother who is for some reason the front man who also won the game a few years back, it really doesn't make sense, doesn't add to the show, and doesn't have a backstory to rest on, but again that's kind of a side story which shouldn't interfere with the main story and the main character's story, so the finale must be great? Right? Not really, the finale starts off okay with the final game but the writing feels extremely off, everyone breaks character, there isn't much story progression, and the worst thing, the old man is behind it all, for some reason the old man (001) is the one who started and made the game because he was too rich, this would've been an okay story if he didn't take part in the game and have his character built off being a poor old man risking it all, because he wouldn't actually die, we also see the main character ( assumably ) try to seek revenge instead of going to get custody of his daughter, which's a major way for Netflix to milk the show by leaving it on a cliffhanger and probably making a second season, i hope they can find a way to make the second season somehow good, but there isn't much to do, he'll just, seek revenge? Then it's over, nothing else to do, other than get his life back in order, which should've been part of the finale, however i have to give credit to this show for consistently having great acting and filming, which's why i think it deserves an 8 regardless of the abysmal choices they took after episode 6."
1807,Squid Game,"I absolutely love this series, but what are those VIPS? Their acting is soooo cringe."
1808,Squid Game,I loved the way the entire drama revolves around the true nature of humans. At every stage this drama never stops to surprise you. Tons of plot twists that add depth to characters and the plot itself. This is one of a kind show (genre & quality wise). You wont find anything like this anywhere. It is absolutely well written.I want to remove my memories and watch this again.
1809,Squid Game,"This is an ok show to watch with an interesting concept. It falls short with its lame and obvious plot twists and has its lengths after episode 6. Can watch, but not a must see."
1810,Squid Game,The first half of the first episode might be a little boring vut the rest of the show is perfect. I couldn't stop watching till the very last minute. It's a MUST watch.
1811,Squid Game,"Short and to the point: Slow start. I didn't feel invested in the main characters' backstory at all. The survival games are pretty entertaining. Although there's way too much unnecessary gore for my liking. The show does generally a great job at portraying the conflict between survival instinct and preserving one's humanity. Last two episodes felt very predictable, cheesy and extremely cliche. Definitely an overrated show, although one worth watching.Ending notes: watch in original Korean dub with subtitles. The English dub is horrendous - the english voice actors fail to convey emotions in their voices."
1812,Squid Game,"This show is so well made. From a technical standpoint, it's shot beautifully and in a way to differentiate itself completely from other shows with similar tones. The lighting, the sets, the costumes, the locations, all fantastic!The idea is great! Most things made sense both story-wise and character-wise. There were a few moments that were questionable when it came to character decisions but it's very easy to look past those as the majority of Squid Game was fantastic. The entire second episode was pretty much dedicated to really making it clear to the audience WHY these characters would subject themselves to such a game and it's done in such a way where it's all very believable.I imagine there is, as always, some errors with Korean to English translation as some of the dialogue (in subtitle form) was incredibly on the nose and structured in a way where people simply don't talk that way but once again, it's easy to look past as the show is so interesting throughout and enjoyable.It felt more like a 9/10 hour movie, rather than a series as each episode flows so seamlessly into the next and carries the momentum, especially when binge watching.Highly recommended."
1813,Squid Game,"I think in my whole life this web series is best means squid game has everything emotion, suspense, thriller, action and more I love this show and i am waiting for season 2."
1814,Squid Game,This is only my second review. I binged this all in one day and loved it. I still like Alice in Borderland better but was a great show. Can't wait for a new season and to see what happens next.
1815,Squid Game,"Like a lot of people I was told that this was a good show and should watch it, so I did and wasn't disappointed. It was full of mystery, action, suspense, and definitely emotion. Each episode was as good as the last and it all came to an epic conclusion. Although I won't spoil it. Anyway 8/10 would recommend.Although there was one problem, there were absolutely 0 squids!"
1816,Squid Game,"When I first saw the trailer, I knew I would watch this show in one day. It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout. The games that were played and the relationships between the characters is what got me into this show even more. Ending was somewhat predictable, but it was still a good show to watch. I do recommend for you to watch it."
1817,Squid Game,"This is definitely worth a watch! Something different and if you like the shock factor and a good bit of gore this is for you..
Episode 6 was quite emotional..
All in all worth a binge .."
1818,Squid Game,"This series will take you out of you mind!!From the storyline to the direction, even the colours make a huge impact to what you see.Until the end that the struggle of the two main characters (001 the one who thought of all this game) and 256 (who actually won the game) one thing was sure. Money is not the solution to all your problems. You see...001 had so much money but couldn't buy time to live longer since he had cancer and 256 when finally got all the money he dreamed of, his best friend and a woman who truly cared was dead, not to mention that when he came home his mother run out of time and was also dead because she suffered from diabetes. He had money but he was all alone.The series will give you another prospective of what life is for some people, but keep in mind that is also violent,brutal and bloody.For me is absolute must see."
1819,Squid Game,"Watched this tv show cos It's well-received recently, but I don't find it really captivating and engrossing for some reason.1. The whole story is proceeding at a very slow pace, and there's too much redundant conversation between characters that provide no important information. Personally speaking, I prefer shows with shortcut conversations that either give out information for the latter episodes or are necessary for portraying the characters.2. illogical and buggy sometimes. In the beginning, it states like the money will accumulate as people die, and 1 person equals 10 million South Korean won, but how come the leading actor receives 456 won while only 455 died? I don't get it."
1820,Squid Game,"Money the orginall story of this serie
you can enjoy,cry,lought and."
1821,Squid Game,"This series is mind blowing. Fast paced thriller action, I haven't blink my eyes during whole series."
1822,Squid Game,"WOW, there are so much twists, action, suspense, drama, and messages all packed in 9 episodes. It is hard to stop watching once you started. One of the best Netflix show ever. I really like the ending."
1823,Squid Game,"Best series of 2021. The series is very beautiful and interesting, a unique series, and the actors were excellent."
1824,Squid Game,"Dystopia theme, cool aesthetics, and ""deep"" ideas do not automatically make something good!!!To be fair, Episode 1 is funny: slapstick and dark humour. And the overall concept, deadly games, is cool. But that's about it. This series is BADLY ACTED, BADLY SCRIPTED, and CRINGEWORTHY throughout.Over-acting makes it hard to take any *deep* conversation seriously.Many conversations are too long and unnecessary - as if the director's just killing time until the next game (the games seem to be the only thing he's good at.)There's some overly dramatic scenes that aren't built up to enough by the plot (e.g. Everyone tries to massacre each other in the night in episode 2 already - before they even got chance to start hating each other...).Many scenes are plain cliché/cringeworthy. Would YOU cry your eyes out at the death of the ""bad guy"" who's just murdered your lady? Cry and cry at your nemesis's death, because you're such a ""good guy""? Ridiculous.The final twists are unnecessary and annoying. I'd rather have seen some better quality acting and scriptwriting throughout.I could say more, but can't be bothered wasting any more time. I already lost 8 hours watching this - and 598 brain cells."
1825,Squid Game,"Really good and high quality show, really exciting to see who will be eliminated next, also shows some aspects of our socitey and millionares,But,I believe there is better, far better shows that are far more exciting, such as Kursadzije."
1826,Squid Game,"The plot:10/10
Characters: 10/10. Cast:10/10
Everything was amazing. It is pretty short but a lot happened. Its a rollercoaster of emotions. Definitely recommend."
1827,Squid Game,Episode 6 really got me hard.Only thing is the subtitles need to be improved.Never had this many tears. Amazing series!
1828,Squid Game,I just created an account to rate this. Perfect korean thriller series! We need more of these.
1829,Squid Game,"Dynamic, involved, exciting, suspenseful and clever, with a vast array of interesting characters. Hopefully this series puts Korea on the map more as a source of great film and tv."
1830,Squid Game,"Awesome guys. I love it even Iam not a guy who can wan watch a series, but really it was super too."
1831,Squid Game,"Seriously this show was like watching an anime. I saw that the director did name a couple of mangas that inspired him but I was shocked this wasn't based of a manga by the same name and story. Really addicting to watch. I see all the other reviews on here dumping on the VIP's but I'll add this... While the acting was atrocious, you're not supposed to like them. In this day in age, villains are always sexy/relatable. I choose to believe the terrible acting helps break the illusion of a ""bad ass"" or a ""sexy villain"". So maybe you can see it that way as well. I have a bigger gripe with...
and I'll spoiler mark this*Spoiler****
-that one VIP got held at gun point and knocked out but he didn't even so much as complain about it to frontman.. TF? At least mention it. I was left hanging there like... So he's cool with that happening to him even though he's ""hard to satisfy"" and was attempting to be this bad dude with impossibly high standards? But that's my only gripe so I still give it a 10!"
1832,Squid Game,"Every actor is fantastic performance
Great story great direction all best."
1833,Squid Game,OfbjsnsnsmymmanNNKYKKYSKSMSNS S DNJJjsjsjsksksmmsmykksksksskksykykmsmsmsmyyjjyjy.
1834,Squid Game,"All these caucasians complaining about the VIPs about their accent or their oddly scripted lines are hilarious to me. I mean hollywood has been doing this to asians for decades, guess everyone feels weird now that it is happening in reverse. For example, Hiring different asian person to play a specific role about a specific asian nationality, hiring white ppl to play asian characters. Not even really learning the correct language or bother to learn the correct pronunciations of their lines. Or even write them a proper line in their own language in a show or a movie. Or forcing asian actors to have an asian accent when the said actor does not actually have one. I guess decades of watching random ppl portraying asians in some gibberish accent has always made me cringe. Now everyone gets to experience it as well hahaha."
1835,Squid Game,"It is attractive, but it is not a very good story."
1836,Squid Game,"It is not very good, but it is attractive at first."
1837,Squid Game,"To start, I can confidently say that Squid Game is one of the best series I've seen in a long time. The plot is near perfectly done, the games keep you on the edge of your seat, and the characters are entertaining. There's not many negative things I can say about Squid Game, but there are 3 main gripes that bothered me the whole way through:1.) The characters are naive. Through the game, players often teamed up and vowed that they would win the game together and split the money. However, the game master made it clearly known that there could only be one winner, yet the characters keep making plans to win the game together.2.) The VIP actors are some of the worst I've ever seen. Their acting was so atrocious, it made the movie feel less like a dark, twisted thriller and more of a parody. What few moments they were on the screen warrants removing a star by itself.3.) Gi-Hun won the game for no reason. After winning the final challenge and ultimately watching his best friend die in the process, Gi-Hun is returned to his home town with the enormous cash prize. He doesn't touch the money and spends an entire year getting drunk. When he finally comes back to his senses and decides to go see his daughter, he learns that the game is still alive and we're left with the inclination that he'll try to end it in the predictable season 2. (The red hair was stupid too)Overall, the series was well done and binge worthy without a doubt. I just hope they don't ruin Squid Game's legacy by putting out a disappointing sequel series."
1838,Squid Game,"I was so excited to watch it at first Bcz it was so popular but when I watch it, it was so boring and makes no sense. I watch it the end btw. The story line was also stupid. It was only popular Bcz the actors and the actresses r pretty and all. It's basically abt playing a game for 45.6 billion dollars and if u join the game u can't quit. And if u quit u will be eliminated. And if u don't follow the game rules u will be eliminated too. Eliminated means u will get shot by these guys from the game and they don't show their identity and hide behind the mask. So umm yea there r sm other k dramas who deserve more hype like the penthouse, hotel del luna, sweet home etc."
1839,Squid Game,"The show is so popular for what? It isn't even that good. The story line was poor and the plot twist too. It also make no sense at all. It was only popular Bcz it's on Netflix and the actor Wi ha joon and hoyeon jong r pretty and hot. Theire acting isn't bad but not the best. I watch it till the end and at first it wasn't that bad and it could've been better but it just got worse. There r sm k dramas that deserve more hype like sweet home, the penthouse, hotel del luna etc."
1840,Squid Game,I think vips act was terrible and they accents was little weird but the players act was fantastic. And i think the ep 2 was boring a little bit for me.
1841,Squid Game,"The gameplay in the film is very interesting and challenging, but the execution at the end feels lacking."
1842,Squid Game,In this story i don't feel the 'plot twist'. Which makes this story good in the acting of the players!
1843,Squid Game,Nice but actors and actress asian is so horribles.......
1844,Squid Game,"I didn't have any expectations as I hadn't read or heard any reviews of the show. I've seen the show pop up every day on my Netflix page and I'm glad I ended up watching it. The stage set, the storyline shows another level of creativeness which is rare nowadays. All in all great show, in my opinion it would be best for it to leave it as it is, without a second season..."
1845,Squid Game,Love it. I really liked it . And if you want a suspense you can watch it. I will recommend it.
1846,Squid Game,"It's the best korian series ever, what can i say. Absolutely fabulous."
1847,Squid Game,"Good story and good caracter developpement
I like it."
1848,Squid Game,"I spent one day watching the 9 episodes really amazing
Unexpected boss in episode 9
Waiting for their second season.A new money heist like series from netflix people will wait every year but don't make it stretched episodes as the last couple if seasons of money heist."
1849,Squid Game,"I have never written an IMDB review, but this show is an exception. Amazing acting (except the VIPs), thrilling plot, and breathtaking cinematography. I had to hold my breath during a lot of the scenes from the suspense! Truly remarkable and well done.It's literally all great except for the VIPs. Their acting is so bad and they really are not great characters. Pompous white people with snooty and rude behaviors. Show didn't need them and would've gotten a 10 without them. Beyond that, watch this. You won't regret it!"
1850,Squid Game,"You are winning because someone is losing. The same thing happening in our practical life. This series is similar to our real life. You own a house, a car, a good life because someone couldn't afford it on the other side. You must watch this show."
1851,Squid Game,"Go watch it if you haven't, it's sure to keep you hooked. The last episode though was not it. Aside that it's a great story, cast, act and music too."
1852,Squid Game,"Squid game is a great movie, definitely fun to watch but had it's downs. Great story, great acting, but could have been way better and could have had a better twist."
1853,Squid Game,Original concept but the final couldnt made me satisfy.
1854,Squid Game,"At first, I wasnt really into this show until I got further into the season and then I was left disoriented. However, it is a very good show in my opinion and I loved it overall. I love the cast and the display of emotions in this show. You can tell that a lot was put into this show and it just drew me in even more."
1855,Squid Game,"First of all, I can't understand why does this show have 8.3 IMBD rating. I am assuming that the audience who have reviewed it are mostly those who haven't watched many series / movies of this genre.All in all it's s just another series with some Psychopath killing every person who is not able to win / survive a game but with a mix of emotions and drama. If you are thinking that this is a series filled with thrilling chilling moments at every step, you are mistaken. The first episode made me think that this could be a bit different but by the third episode I was wondering why am I even watching it. Every now and then, there will be useless drama, emotional dialogues explaining why each character is playing this game, what their monetary problems are and why they want to get the prize money at any cost. Many useless dialogues and excessive emotional drama that do not make any sense in this kind of series. Side plot stories that lead to nowhere in the end. Lead character is dumb and remains dumb till the end. Acting by the cast is okayish but it deteriorates drastically by the last two episodes. This series is not worth your time. If you like watching psychological thrillers where people get massacred then there are many way better than this like The Collection, Saw Series, Get Out(2017), Final Destination series etc.But if you want to watch it anyways because of the hype or because of your interest in what the hell these games are, skip to the following timestamps for these episodes and you will be satisfied -Episode 1: full episodeEpisode 2: Ignore. Everyone is just a cry baby. No games in this one.Episode 3: After 28:00Episode 4: After 39:58Episode 5: Till 02:20, no games in this one. Just a dumb side story.Episode 6: Start at 14:56. This is the most boring one and unfortunately the game takes up the whole episode. Watch this at 1.5x speed.Episode 7: After 17:57, this has a little bit of thrilling momentsEpisode 8: 17:07 to 26, no games but important for the last episode.Episode 9: first 20 mins."
1856,Squid Game,"Drama seems exaggerated, I don't know what is discussed here. Comedy, action, betrayal and sex elements put together so I'm confused about which genre to focus on first. It's a mess to be honest.The drama is rather predictable, there is an element of surprise in this drama but not all of it.I loved episode 7, it's really cool. But nothing else, because I don't think so. How can acting and dramas like this become a historical drama netflik in 83 countries can even be called worldwide history.But this story can show some addictive scenes, I like it. Watching this is addictive, and makes me curious at least."
1857,Squid Game,"It's not a bad show; there's certainly worse ones there (ehem the 100, ehem riverdale), but the concept isn't original, the acting/execution doesn't look different from any other decent tv show, and the only thing that makes it stand out to some extent is the exceptional cinematography. At the end of the day, there are worse shows to spend your time on, and if you have 8-9 hours to kill, Squid Game can do the trick.Midnight Mass by Mike Flanagan was better though."
1858,Squid Game,Every episode is exiting and filled with good plot.Acting seems very realistic. The show is also unpredicteble. Many plot twists and different story lines. I liked this a lot.
1859,Squid Game,"I fell into this rabbit hole of Korean shows last two years. Certainly Squid Game is the top on my best show list.Why? I don't know. You try it and tell me.I kept thinking of this show so randomly. I am sure many of you are the same. Among Korean shows, Monster (2021) presents no doubt the best quality in every aspect but I didn't live with it over weeks. In this ""survival game"" genre, Battle Royal or Hunger Game was only made into my okay list.Perhaps, knitted netted symbolism through the series. Perhaps, the beautiful art direction. Perhaps, annoying but relatable characters. Perhaps, the arching heart-breaking.It's a total gift."
1860,Squid Game,"This is a beautifully casted, acted and written show. Brilliant.I watch many Korean series and all of them are amazing but this one tops them all. Koreans have done again. Once you start, you will not stop until its finished, thats what happened with me."
1861,Squid Game,"The advantages are all over. Let me talk about the most disgusting thing. Just like the director's former work which is ""Silenced"", the screen is full of sensationalism."
1862,Squid Game,"Squid Game is the single worst tv show that I have ever watched. From the script to the direction, to the framing : everything is hideous. Really disappointed I wasted some time of my life watching it.PS : thanks for destroying Le Beau Danube Bleu."
1863,Squid Game,"At the first images I immediately thought of the hunger games. Game makers make the players do bad things and also in squidgame it is displayed so beautifully and realistically. What good actors. I am an all-round make-up artist myself, but if you have this on your resume as a muah, you should be proud. Very well. I also believe that this is based on things that actually happen because money worries are big and people are desperate. I know all the games that are played, but not the heavy versions. I think it's a very strong series and the ending was very predictable, but also very open. I hope for a season two."
1864,Squid Game,"Contrasting the acting style of often lighthearted Korean TV with a hunger games style thriller, squid game will keep you guessing what comes next.The scenarios and psychological coercion the characters go through is believable enough to suspend disbelief.At its core, the show is an effective critique of capitalism and the lengths people will go to to get rich."
1865,Squid Game,This show is a must watch if you haven't already. It's an enjoyable 9 hours which keeps bringing something new and enjoyable to the table. The show makes you want to root for the team even when you know that in the end only one will remain.That being said there is a side plot with poorly acted VIPs which wasn't that great. This would have maybe been something for a later season because not all answers need answering right away.
1866,Squid Game,"Absolutely amazing, I really enjoyed watching this series, gaining an appreciation of the cast and their dedication to the roles. Almost perfect, I would've personally wanted to have been provided with more clarity by the end as to who was overseeing the games, but this is just a personal preference, as I am aware some of the audience preferred the ambiguity."
1867,Squid Game,"One of the best series of this century .Brilliant acting
Brilliant Direction
Brilliant Story line
Extraordinary background music
fun to watch
6 out of 5."
1868,Squid Game,"One of the best series of this century .Brilliant acting

1869,Squid Game,"Squid Game, a Korean Netflix TV Series that made an unexpected hit and blew up worldwide with a whopping 111 million views since its debut mid-September. I only recently finished the show, but I have friends who finished it a couple weeks back and are still ""hyping it up."" The director took us on quite the interesting journey through the plot, starting with sympathetic feelings towards the players, to disgust, to thrillers, and perhaps to anger as well. Starting from the first episode, the Squid Game seemed a childish, but promising way of attaining financial freedom for the players. That is until everyone learned the term eliminated referred to being eliminated from existence itself, meaning death. The blood and gore were not only gruesome and scary for the players of the game, but also for the audience that was watching. I remember flinching and jumping out of my seat when the first player was shot down in the Red Light Green Light game, knowing his death was coming, yet somehow still unexpected and shocking. The game was designed such so that it was immoral to proceed since the billions of won, as the reward money for winning, was being accumulated based on the deaths of other players. However, this is where the true nature of everyone showed. The true nature of humans. It didn't matter if you were native, foreign, religious, male, female, smart, thug, or whatever, everyone suddenly developed a greed for money and lost all their morals. I think the director wrote the plot this way to expose the ""natural"" greed all humans have, and to show the audience to what extremes people would go for their personal gain. I think this show is a reminder to all people that the world is not as innocent as some people may think. It is a world filled with lies and deceit built to support those in power, or otherwise the rich. This brings me to another point the director makes evident in the last few episodes. Money truly cannot buy everything in this world, especially not happiness, which we learned from Il Nam, host of the squid games, but also a player. We learn that everyone has their own problems with life, the only difference is that the circumstances are different. Overall, it was a good TV Show for entertainment, but I think it should be more of an eye-opening experience for viewers to wake up to reality."

1871,Squid Game,"This is just a masterpiece from the beginning. The sets are all real, which brings just a greater sense of awe to the spectacle that is Squid Game. The actors are picked perfectly, and all play a major part into making this the marvel it is. The story ramps up almost scene by scene, bringing true emotions to my face while watching it. Sadness, happiness, anger, and at times disgust are major emotional aspects within the first season. The ending was amazing, but also brought a ton of emotion out of me due to the connection I felt that I gained during watching this. I have one reserved worry to this series, and that is the execution of the next season. At times, series can burn out or run out of that initial spark that drove the show to stardom. An example of a popular show that felt to lose this spark would be Riverdale. I hope this is not the case for Squid Game, and I will be rooting for it to continue its great success."
1872,Squid Game,Good show but declines in the later episodes. I liked the earlier episodes and the show peaked in my opinion at the marble episode but it went downhill from there. The last episode in particular was not very good. 7.5/10.
1873,Squid Game,"Squid Game Ojing-eo Geimis a South Korean survival drama television series on Netflix created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, who wrote and directed all nine episodes. Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, Jung Ho-yeon, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi, and Kim Joo-ryoung. The series revolves around a contest where 456 players in deep financial debt put their lives at risk to play a series of children's games for the chance to win a 45.6 billion a prize. The title of the series draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang had conceived of the idea based on his own economic struggles early in life as well as the class disparity in South Korea. Though he had initially written it in 2009, he was unable to find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of their drive to expand their foreign programming offerings."
1874,Squid Game,Just overrated. Just ordinary compared to other dead game genre creations. The storyline and plot is simple and it's tragic plots are not so much touching. Just overrated.
1875,Squid Game,"Copying Japanese games mainly, I don't like people who don't work but ask for food, just like to take other people's ideas, other people's culture, other people's products and call it a traditional game mine. Even if the movie is accessible to viewers, it's unacceptable to eat other people's brains."
1876,Squid Game,"It's fun, but it's not that great. The cops laying the plot to death do me dislike and at the end of the story I don't like it. It's a story made of 10 point, and it's slowly coming down."
1877,Squid Game,"Honestly I didn't see a really original, uniq scenario. It was like a combination of different previous movies. I think Netflix users are really desperately waiting a good serie and when they find ""not terrible one"" , they think it is great. For sure we can't deny the quality of acting of main characters (not all) also should int be denied some parts of scenario was like written by a high school teenager.Let's say ""it was not a waste of time"" but i don't think anyone will wstch over and over again. Just a one night stand serie."
1878,Squid Game,"Really a good series that shows how money can play and change the minds of people.Entertaining but Emotional..
I gave it a 10/10,but still I didn't satisfied with the climax.Waiting for season 2..."
1879,Squid Game,"So Squid Game has taken over the world these last few weeks and I thought that I had to watch it and I have now finished it and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck Koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize.Main Character Lee Jung-Jae plays the lead character Gi-Han on the show and he is fantastic. At first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions. As he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support.Style The show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole. It is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale. The pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and great in there own way.I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it's nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the ""kill game"" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera."
1880,Squid Game,Nothing new rich powerful ppl entertained by seeing poor ppl die. I saw a lot of Korean drama that much better. It's like am watching America's movie from 2014 Hunger Games Maze Runner I don't get the hype about it???
1881,Squid Game,Everyone just watches it because its trending on social media. I played red light green light as a child in 1995 so no need for me to watch. I watch like 7 mins and turn that trash off.
1882,Squid Game,Not. I have to say that you have to be a good friend to me and I will be grateful if you can help me with. I have attached my resume for your kind perusal and hope to hear from you soon as I am currently working on the same and I am currently working on the project management project and I am currently working on the project management project and I am currently working on the project management.
1883,Squid Game,"This is an objectively good show no doubts about it, but considering how all of internet blew up on it I was expecting something better and felt disappointed by how it was. It wasn't bad. Just nowhere near as good as I initially anticipated. Overhyped. But objectively good.Spoiler warning
Main issue of mine is when contestant no. 1 is later revealed to be the main admin in charge of the games. It just heavily undermines the whole point of the games being supposedly fair. Kind of left me with a feeling of - everyone is equal but others are more equal. And the police officer subplot. Most likely it'll be expanded upon in S2, but otherwise you could easily cut it out from the show and it wouldn't change a thing I'd say."
1884,Squid Game,This series is very exciting and very good. All the games played are mind-blowing. Actors act like a real film. This film shows how a common man who was in debt played games and win a handsome money 45.6 billion dollars. 😳😎
1885,Squid Game,"!SPOILER WARNING!I love Squid Game and perhaps a 9/10 is even a bit generous of a rating. The show entertains me yet I feel like the writing in it is under appreciated. It is what has gotten me into a South Korean film phase, as I love its deep messages about social class and poverty in the country. The 2nd episode ""Hell"" is what really made me love this show. In the former episode, the majority vote decided to leave the bloodthirsty games after over 200 people died. In this episode ""Hell"", we see the main characters being discriminated by their place in society, quite literally in hell. All of these characters go back to the games after realizing that its not so much better out in their normal lives than the killing game. That is poetic and just endlessly watchable. Squid Game has some questionable twists like the Old Man but it foreshadows them well, and still provide a great show."
1886,Squid Game,"Every year a movie or series comes out that becomes a phenomenon. This year, it seems that the South Korean mini-series called ""The Squid Game"" will receive the title of ""TV Series of the Year"" ahead of schedule. The series is on the Netflix platform and consists of 9 episodes. My expectations were justified! What pleased me the most was that the series had meaning, and not just stupid goreThere are many central characters in the series. You can, however, single out the main character. It's Song Ki-hoon, not a very handsome guy with big money problems. By coincidence, Gi-hoon gets into a certain game in which there is a huge cash prize and in which the same poor fellows as our hero participate.What surprised me is that the characters are distinguishable! Song Gi-hoon, grandpa, girl-thief, bandit, Pakistani... Each of the listed characters is recognizable and I didn't have the feeling that this series was really Korean. Well, or almost none, because after all, many faces were purely Korean ... I liked the games themselves, which the organizers of the show came up with. I don't even know which one to pick.I look forward to the second season, it will have a lot of new characters for obvious reasons. I recommend watching this high-quality Korean series!"
1887,Squid Game,"The gods of Olympus got bored somehow...and they decided to remember the children's games, what a time it was!The film was shot by Korean talented screenwriter and director Hwang Dong-hyuk.He himself was having a hard time at that time. I was sitting in a cafe and read in the newspapers how many Koreans are sitting in loans and debts, that it is impossible to get out of this web.For the script, I used the everyday stories of my friends and neighbors. Friends read it and suggested what else to add. The script was written in a year, but the shooting of the film started after 10 years, the situation has been maturing for so long.The ending surprised me why the hero was inactive for a year, and then I realized. There is no excuse for people who fight for the welfare of their relatives at such a price. And a ""very pleasant reward"" will not return life to the dead...there are also families, relatives, mothers...You can cling to the film for a long time about its moral component, the life stories of the characters' personalities that are not written down to the end..."
1888,Squid Game,It was the truely the best show of the decade. I watched the whole show non stop and there was not even a single dull moment. Please release the next season as soon as possible.
1889,Squid Game,"Please try watching Escape Room(2019). The plot and the idea are pretty similar.Squid Game is lack of originality. It's just now people are obsessed with anything to do with Korean, no matter those are movies or music or whatever.As usual, the Korean actors are over ""acted"""
1890,Squid Game,Squid Game has an interesting plot that hooks you on the first episode. The rules of the show is ever changing though with surprises on each entry. How far would you be willing to go to play the game?
1891,Squid Game,"It was fun to watch, had some unexpected games, except of course for the squid game in the end. We all saw that one coming, right?The thing that bothers me the most is the lack of character development... I don't understand the main character. He exactly knows what he gets into when he re-enters the game. Still he is frozen all the time with guilt and pity. When he wins, he does nothing with the money for a year? He keeps on neglecting his daughter, and the little orphan brother till the bizar Christmas scene in the end.. Next season he will go jack Bauer on their asses..The show was full of sloppy characters like 'Han Mi-nyeo': the lady from the sex scene. I didn't care about her at all, but she was one of the most interesting characters. She would do anything to survive: fuck, kill, smuggle,... What made her like that? The fact that she committed suicide (something completely against her instincts), could have been an amazing moment, but it was not.."
1892,Squid Game,Great to watch this series. The story was gripping and the acting was exciting... except for the VIPs who came in the last couple of episode. They could have done better.At times I felt that dialogues were a bit too long but you have to complete the time slot. The lead actors were great in their roles.
1893,Squid Game,"!!! UNPOPULAR OPINION !!! - no spoilersLike many things nowadays, this show was hyped to hell. Any objective opinion doesn't matter any more. If « they » tell you it's amazing, then you're going to « think » it's amazing. It's not.Squid Game is far from ""amazing"".The show actually starts really well, with an interesting approach to anti capitalism, and a strong visual language. But there are just so many writing inconsistencies that it's impossible to take it seriously, and it pulled me out of the experience. There are countless situations where things feel unnatural, forced, specially near the ending. Other things just don't make sense, like the main character's choice at the end. The last episodes feel unfinished, unpolished, and underwhelming.And the ending...omg. Botched to hell. The final twist is so idiotic, so so lazy... « Let's make a shocking twist ! » - the writers must've thought... Boring.However, Squid Game was still fun to watch, with strong moments here and there. But is it up the hype ? Absolutely not.Ultimately, the show tries too hard to be special, and in doing so, it fails to be coherent.It's basically Westworld, but much worse, and for teenagers.Sorry..."
1894,Squid Game,"What was entertaining about it? Nothing. Beilko Experiment and Escape Room is way better. What was supposed to be some comedic scenes was blah to me. There was so many cliches, it wasn't horribly written just produced poorly in my opinion. The only good thing I can say about it that I didn't need to read any subtitles. It's a waste of time. I honestly can't think of one scene that was a little entertaining. The last episode was even worse. I really hope Netflix doesn't renew this nonsense because of the hype."
1895,Squid Game,"Platform + 120 days of Sodom + Eyes wide shut = Squid Game for me.I don't know what I was waiting in the end but I'm kind of disappointed, espacially by the last decision he made."
1896,Squid Game,"I do love my typical hero's journey Marvel/DC movies/series but this one was something different entirely, a breath of fresh air.Unexpectedly I opened up my Netflix account and this show's plot synopsis grabbed my attention. Next thing I know I'm getting pulled all the way through an unexpected 1-day binge session (about 9 hours).The show is slow at times yet never boring, just taking its time between brutal fatalities (and brutal they are). The characters are troubled, each of them with their flaws (even the main character). That too felt fresh compared to the typical Hollywood protagonists who always seem to be so likable with a ton of charisma and humor.Creative story wise but also in its graphics. I loved the looks of the location with its game rooms and the characters. Speaking of Marvel, the costume of the Frontman would make a great Dr Doom outfit.Anyway long story short, just go watch it. You won't regret it."
1897,Squid Game,Series was tracking as a solid 7 or 8 prior to the last episode. All of the finishing 'revalations' and gotchas were just plain stupid and not needed. Otherwise great upto that point.
1898,Squid Game,"This was well written, acted, executed. VIPs played their role. I don't know what people wanted from their screen time. Overall great show. Some scenes felt drawn out from time to time, but other than that. Great show."
1899,Squid Game,"Only because i hated the americans. Worst part of the story, unnecessary distraction + terrible acting.I was right since the beginning, but I really don't care. I don't care if some things where predictable, it didn't ruin the series for me. GREAT STORY/IDEA (except foe the americans part) SUPERB writting + great acting (except for those stupid americans) ."
1900,Squid Game,"Plotholes so thick you might actuall bury the 200000 people they killed over 30 years.. in the same region.Even thinking slightly about the story of the movie hurts... 400-500 people per game, at least 12 seasons per year starting in 1988. And what about all the survivors who left due to democratic vote? They have thousands of people with the same story. His report to the local police should be more than a well known story.. and seriousl 200000 people gone even in a span pf 30 years.. thats murder on such a scale... it would impact the GDP of the country... whoever wrote this clearly has their plot development as high a level as the actual kid games.. yet still the acting was very great BUT the voice acting is beyond atrocious no matter if its due to bad directing or bad voice actors. For all the hype watching this was a very sober disappointment.The writing seriously seems written by a child.. writing without thinking and unable to see the story development in the future... literally nothing makes sense in this show if you think about it.. and the morale is as cheap as the next 2000s internet bloggers longest post."
1901,Squid Game,"It's watchable but i really don't get from where it got so much good reviews... The concept is nothing new, totally predictable, overloaded with all stereotypes... VERY AVERAGE SERIES. That's it!I can only imagine people having discussions about it and extrapolate to human behaviors, what they would do in same situation or full with theories on how money controls our lives etc pfffffffff... boring!!!I watched it but with my finger constantly on the +10 sec..."
1902,Squid Game,"To begin I need to say the show is lower mediocre.Actors performances are patheticly boring as if they were trying to convince themselves that their acting is right. They did not convince me at all. Especialy the main characters seem like hobby actors to me.Plot is so flawed that by the episode 5 is does not come together already and plus is so predictable that you can guess whats coming pretty much all the time if you use your brain a bit.The whole idea and mesaage of the show (the indebted society we live in) is not groundbreaking either for it has been depicted in far better titles than this one.My personal opinion is that netflix had to hype up some of their show already because of the poor production they have had in past 2 years and so they finaly decided to heavily market one of their shows and they did bet on this one because its different from anything else most people seen. Mainly because of the fact that it is not american neither european culture you are getting from this one.In fact you can not relate to the characters at all until episode 5-6 for the korean culture is so different from what we europeans and americans probably too (even though americans and their culture are pretty demented so you can never really tell) can relate to.To conclude as I already indicated above the only catchy thing about this title is how different it os from what we are used to ""consume"". Like a breath of fresh air that you realize after a minute or two is not really that fresh.The raw depiction of brutality is what I believe attracted the people most to this show but really there is nothing more to it.Lastly Id like to add that 4 out 9 episodes (1,2,7 and 9 - it is really a shame that final episode is one of the weakest of the season/show) were boring and really low quality.I scored this one 6/10 and anyone that has seen more than just the most commercial bites from international cinematography can only agree."
1903,Squid Game,"It doesn't appeal at first, but if you you'll stay tuned, you'll see a really good drama series with some very well written characters.Watch it!"
1904,Squid Game,"For some reason it reminds me ""Snowpiercer"". It's claustrophobic, paranoiac, futuristic, twisted and lethal. Style and costumes are very iconic. You cant forget those pink suits after watching it."
1905,Squid Game,"The first two episodes were very promising. Nice balance between violence, humor and craziness. From episode 5 everything goes downhill. The story becomes something softy... People becoming too emotional in the ordinary ways... Also, the last episode was bad, vague dialogues, completely ridiculous choices by the main character and an ending that doesn't make sense at all.To end on a good note, the acting was terrific and the effects and camerawork were excellent!"
1906,Squid Game,"I liked it overall BUT:
The VIPs acted terrible and their script was super cringyIt was kind of obvious that the old man was the creatorThe police side-story didn't really have a purpose. At lesst not for this season."
1907,Squid Game,"Perfect acting 👌.. interesting series, with unexpected events."
1908,Squid Game,"So I have rated a ton of movies on here but never actually been compelled to write a review until now. I was hesitant to watch Squid Game because I'm not a fan of foreign films, I'm lazy and don't like to read movies. I heard this was dubbed and how much everyone talked about it so I gave it a shot. Well...I watched all 8 episodes in one day and all I can say is wow. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen, and I watch a lot of TV. This show kept surprising me at every turn. Some of the back story stuff was a little cheesy/predictable, but it didn't even matter because the actual game itself was well worth the watch. The characters were well written and I cared what happened to them. This was a unique idea that was well written and well made. I would recommend to anyone looking for something different. A little gory at times but that's part of what makes it so shocking. Must see TV."
1909,Squid Game,"Unexpected movie, brilliant idea,. This is one of the Best movie this year, Jobwell done !!! Netflix should continue to produce a movie like this.. 👍"
1910,Squid Game,"The core show idea was great and unique, the personas were well found out, but there are parts where it all gets boring and predictable. VIPs' acting and their speech were terrible. Episode 6 was the top of the show, with 10/10 rating if you ask me. It raised big moral questions and was the culmination point of character development. After that, hours could've been skipped, as they don't really add anything to the story."
1911,Squid Game,"The series are absolutely interesting, the plot is excellent and the actors are great, too! I really recommend this show to everyone."
1912,Squid Game,"Bad acting, bad storyline, full of plotholes, just a show for the unintelligent that haven't seen better shows.I really tried, but the acting is all so terrible, it's like looking at a bad school play."
1913,Squid Game,Great show.... Netflix has done it again!Keeps you guessing...
1914,Squid Game,8.3 today...we are living in a magnificent world... can't understand why people are thinking this show so great...gambling and cruelty...
1915,Squid Game,"Good writing, poor message. Some notable plot holes but nothing ruins it more than a main character who signs up for the games, sees death, is allowed to leave and then comes back to play only to blame other people for the fates of the fallen players. The show makes the people who understand what the games are out to be villains. And of course the foolish, self righteous, hypocrite wins it all."
1916,Squid Game,"I absolutely love it! It reminds me of JIGSAW and ESCAPES ROOM. It make you feel like you are part of the squid game while watching. It will definitely leave you guessing who will survive in the end. I absolutely love HoYeon Jung acting, she's really tough, really cute and beautiful all around. I loved HoYeon Jung character, she kept to herself, strong minded, didn't trust anyone and I love her serious image. She was really amazing! I wish HoYeon Jung could stay for more seasons but unfortunately she died towards the end and I was really upset about it! It was really sad. Keep it coming for more seasons."
1917,Squid Game,The series was hot to start! Grabbing you and keeping you hooked until episode 3-4 and the true purpose of the game and show started to dwindle. I wish they stuck to the rules and had more games to focus on. Wasnt as intriguing watching them very un-cinematic-like kill each other off. A show that had so much potential fell just short due to poor writing.
1918,Squid Game,One of the best TV Shows I have ever seen. Simply genious and almost realistic. 6th episode is FABULOUS.I love this TV Show and one of the favourites from 2021.
1919,Squid Game,"Just binged season, i was hooked after the second episode.After seeing the vip's i went looking for some reviews. Boy... the acting was so out of place. It felt so weird, upon the VIP encounter the acting was really good. It kinda breaks the whole atmosphere.Nevertheless definitly worth watching."
1920,Squid Game,"From the start to finish, the show is an emotional roller coaster. Full of mystery and suspense. Only downside I'd say is that, due to nature of the show, we had an idea who would win. All main characters were quickly realised and we had a expectation that who'd make it. Not as suspenseful as perhaps Game of thrones. I mean I know its only 9 part show and the show runner had no idea where it would go.It's a crime that it's been sitting on shelf for 12 years before someone gave it a GREEN LIGHT. I mean we could have been on season 12 or perhaps it would have ended by now.I personally can't wait for season 2."
1921,Squid Game,"I keep seeing people saying that the characters were told that only 1 people could survive. I don't know if they watch a wrongly translated version or what but the version i watch they are told they all can win the prize as long as they finish the 6 games.I also get that the VIPs acting and ""intonation"" suck, but keep in mind this is a korean show so why would they accurately portrait americans?Show is amazing, main characters acting is superb and music is very good. Just enjoy."
1922,Squid Game,"A likely tale based on real life experiences. The elites (VIPs) participate in these types of twisted events. ""The Most Dangerous Game"" ""The Game."" Did you notice many of the movie's scenes resembled kill rooms similar to those leaked during Clinton and Podesta's #pizzagate? So ask yourself, why this soft disclosure movie full of kids' games, toys, color, and imagery? What kind of people are REALLY directing ""The Game"" and who are the INNOCENTS forced to play? This series is once again attempting to disclose the same sickness Kubrick did and was killed for in ""Eyes Wide Shut""!"
1923,Squid Game,"I finally watched the show after there was so much hype surrounding it everywhere. The first episode was ok and I still thought I would get to watch a good and thrilling tv show.It went downhill fast and never recovered. I have never watched a show before that I had to speed up to be able to finish it but this is what happened. The show is incredibly emotionally draining, painfully slow and violent for no reason but shock value. The acting is comical, the characters are all horrible and you lose faith in humanity.While I was watching it, I realized that this is the most antisocial show I have ever watched. The amount of sadism is something I couldn't overlook. I have a lot of questions when it comes to this show and the people who made it, as well as their intentions.The fact that this is considered entertainment is chilling to me. It's like nobody actually sees how damaging stuff like this can be and we are just hyping anything.Now you could have created a show with this exact storyline in a way where it works, it all depends on the execution - and this one was a complete fail."
1924,Squid Game,My first review... you will not regret watching this as fans of both thrillers and korean dramas... this film really has outdone itself.
1925,Squid Game,Why are people into this dumb show. Dumb plain dumb. I was intrigued by what would happen by episode 9 I was ready for this nightmare of a show to be over.
1926,Squid Game,Acting very hit or miss. Ending kinda wack. Vip scenes were extremely cringey and poorly done. Plot holes here and there. Things that are really unbelievable like 2 people getting away with using a lighter in the honeycomb game.
1927,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a roller coaster from start to finish! I had no expectations going in and left captivated by the world created - I'm already ready for Season 2.The show is filled with all kinds of twists and turns. The plot is wonderfully planned out with lots of foreshadowing and hints toward the future, but just enough to keep you guessing. I was literally on the edge of my seat for episodes 4, 5, and 6.The masterful use of color paired with the cinematography made it a joy to watch, and the somber music really drew you in.The real big takeaway from this show, though, was the character-driven story. All the actors from the leads to the extras were phenomenal, and I hope to see many members of the ensemble in future projects. Jung Ho-yeon absolutely crushes her first big acting role - keep an eye out for her in the future!A must watch in 2021."
1928,Squid Game,"Just binged the whole 9 episodes, best thing I've seen on Netflix since I opened my account. Even though it's dubbed, you hardly notice! Watch it, you won't be disappointed! 👍👍👍"
1929,Squid Game,I Think dubbing was all done by the same person just putting on silly voices probably is a good series but is a hard watch as the dubbing is shocking makes it a very hard watch.
1930,Squid Game,"I really think this show could have been great. The plot, the attention to detail... all spot on. The dialogue however, is SO juvenile. It's like sitting around the table with a bunch of middle schoolers. The voice over acting itself is obviously horrid, but the dialogue is what kills it. From what I understand from a previous review from someone who speaks both fluent Korean and English, it was not translated well at all.It's so disappointing that the writers, directors, and actors put so much heart and soul in to this, only for the dialogue to be lazily translated and acted. Shame on Netflix for dropping the ball here."
1931,Squid Game,"Binge watched #squid_game today. The idea of the show is not new. It was presented in a movie called 13 in 2010 but it was a Russian Roulette game rather than kids' games. I enjoyed the show but didn't feel it's worth the hype that people have made about it. Anyway if you haven't watched it, please do if you enjoy psychotic movies like American Psycho and The Game."
1932,Squid Game,"Obviously I watched it out of curiosity after the internet was flooded by memes and news about this show. It's not a bad watch but I find it severely overrated. The visuals are great, I will give them that, but past the production there's no real quality and meaning in the story. I love a good horror story but the crude brutality/slasher type of movie is not my understanding of a quality horror movie, so maybe that's why I was not impressed. You'll just watch this show and then go on about business as usual, it doesn't leave anything behind."
1933,Squid Game,"After countless memes and word of mouth suggestions, my girlfriend and I decided to checkout Squid Game. After an episode an a half we decided to stop. It's not the subject matter or the fact that it's an overused story, honestly it just wasn't very good. It was hard to find what all the hype was about. We had a similar experience with Money Heist. Maybe it's the fact that we watched both shows with the English dubbing, I don't know. With squid game however, I just found the acting to be over the top and cheesy. The dubbing just made this so much worse. Example (police officer: ""red light green light, you mean that game meant for kids?"") TERRIBLY CHEESY writing right there and horrible voice acting. I just can't understand why everyone has been telling me I NEED to watch this show. It was honestly an embarrassing experience, save your time and watch a quality series. 6/10 for filmmaking, 0/10 for writing, acting, and originality. 3/10 total."
1934,Squid Game,"I confess to watching every episode before realizing the characters were an overused, worn-out personality mix, the plot was predictable and the hundreds of assassination style killings were the central plot driver.But still part me enjoyed the novelty, the exposure of human fragilities and the bright color sets and costuming.The product is not that great, the remarkable popularity might be explained by the economic desperation many of us feel right now and perhaps it taps into a growing resentment toward the financial elite."
1935,Squid Game,"From the first episode to the last one, this show is top notch. Its a story about life.The struggle that humans go through just to see another day. I watched this show with my girlfriend and we cried a lot together. It was so emotional.I recommend it to everyone who wants to experience greatness. Kudos to the creators and actors."
1936,Squid Game,The violence and gore was fine. It was the over the top excessive smoking that upset me the most.
1937,Squid Game,"The whole series is super exciting as the episodes are based on childhood games played by grown up people, where elimination means losing life. The tension maintained throughout the game scenes is really incredible and should be appreciated. Though the first few episodes starts slow, as well as the ending episodes gradually paces down. The screenplay, background music, editing, set design are extremely talented. The topic is also pretty unusual though I won't say exceptional. Apart from that there are too many plot holes and gaps that these bugged me so much throughout the whole series, for example (no spoiler), the cop cracking the morse code, or keeping the phone charged even though there were no charging port and so much more. Even though the story line is supposed to be dark, gore, thought provoking, but because of a certain Korean flavor it feels like a bit immature in the sense of logic and in some cases childish too. The most matured acting was done by the character kang Soe-byeok and Cho Sang-Woo. Other main actors were only good. Some actors were painfully poor, especially the VIP's. Entertainment wise this series is a must watch, but overall it's an over-hiped Netflix show, which gives an idea about the new generation audiences who haven't watched good quality shows and gets easily overwhelmed by average shows."
1938,Squid Game,"Sooo good but dammit, he should've got on the plane!!"
1939,Squid Game,This is not a must see.. definitely.. there was so much noise about this series but finally that was pure good marketing... there are way better ways around to kill your time......
1940,Squid Game,Squid Game takes a oft used trope and keeps it fresh and gripping.
1941,Squid Game,"Couldn't get past 15 mins into the first episode.. I don't know if it was originally subbed and they dubbed it instead; but the acting is awful, it's incredibly slow and predictable and honestly don't know what the ""hype"" is about this show, or why people rave about how ""good"" it is."
1942,Squid Game,In my opinion they played so ridiculously bad to portrait what they think about the Americans and to mock them with their bad jokes. Their cast was really good and i dont think they just didn't get the right actors to play the Americans.
1943,Squid Game,Series is ok. But the end is very bad. They could made something different. It's looked like they lost idea how to finish the season. If they wanted to make some room for the season 2 the could be more creative.
1944,Squid Game,"About capitalism and other hidden things.Squid Game is an entertaining series that draws the light on modern problems from a unique angle.We all fall into debt, we all have problems that need a miracle to be solved, but what is the cost of a miracle?Great acting, great cinematography, great production design and a really clever scenario that made us on the edge of our seats nine episodes long.Since I started watching Korean art I always have had problems with their way of acting.. Or to be precise with their way of expression..
(oh yeong-su) the Korean actor.. Changed that forever.. His truthful way of expression really astonished me. I wanted him to be present in every frame.Im thankful for the director and for Netflix they made this happen.. This will make me - in the future- consider following Korean art regularly.If you watched the show and you came here looking for answers, explanations or analysis.. I advice you not to.. This show is intendedly made for every one of us to understand it on his own.. And to interpret it his way.. Yet I think it has the same effect.. Nothing is more important than a human soul.I'm a Muslim but i recall from the Bible :
""For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?"""
1945,Squid Game,"Like everyone else all I heard about for weeks was Squid Game, so naturally I had to check it out. Oh boy was I disappointed.The premise of the show is fine enough, 456 people deep in debt compete in games to win a life changing amount of money with the twist being anyone who loses a game is killed. That's it, that's the show. There are a few tiny wrinkles that you can discover if you choose to watch, but it is not very deep.I have seen plenty of praise for the show's criticism of capitalism, but really it is a very surface level critique that fails to go beyond a high school level argument of ""inequality bad!"" with no solutions or alternatives presented. However, it uses this shallow argument as an excuse for a whole lot of self-indulgent violence that serves little purpose other than painting the screen you're watching on red.Ultimately Squid Game is nothing more than a nine hour long popcorn flick, which is seven hours too many to dedicate to a show that might as well be renamed ""Saw (but this time Korean)."""
1946,Squid Game,"The series is a collection of second-hand ideas, characters and plots collected from all over the place - starting from a Japanese movie 'Shinkansen daibakuha' about desperate workers finishing with a Russian movie 'New Land' about letting prisoners manage themselves. Not to mention dozens of survive-for-money US movies such as recent 'Escape Room'.The only reason this series seems to appeal to Netflix auditorium is because it's Korean, so entourage and decorations look fresh and new."
1947,Squid Game,"Extra star rating for not giving a **** and including unnecessary blm or lgbt agenda. Great show, really shows what animals some of us really are deep inside."
1948,Squid Game,Great start with no worthwhile return. Lat episodes waste time and give no value to end. Absolutely stupid show.
1949,Squid Game,"Once I got over the terrible dubbing, and persevered with the conflicting English CC and English Standard subtitles (with both English and Korean audio), I painstakingly dragged myself through all 9 episodes.Some of the worst acting I've seen in a foreign movie, story is ridiculous (and I watch a lot of B movies), overall a really bad attempt at Saw style movie with a terrible ending.Don't watch, not worth the hype."
1950,Squid Game,Netflix knows how to promote an avg series.only 2 episode were good.
1951,Squid Game,"So gambling, is bad, I try not to bet much only when I did decide to pick Green Bay for 50 and Chiefs for 50 and get 130 back because Green Bay loss... and I could've gotten another 160. So you see, gambling isn't good😂. Anyways the main theme of this show is in Korea people struggle. And everyone's life's suck ass.The show follows this guy who just won big in Horse racing and gets picked pocketed and loan Sharks come after him and then meets a stalker business man. They play ddakji. This a game where you have to flip the paper on the ground, and the main character loses and in exchanged gets slapped to lose 100,000 wons from the debt count. And so he walks away with 200,000 wons. And so he returns home and his mom is upset because he looks brutally beaten up. Anyways he has the card from the business man and goes to where he'll be picked up and enter the game: Squid game duh duh duh. Also he's number 456. And so he learns they're gonna play the worse twisted Saw like games that are children games basically- Red light/Green Light, Honey comb cutting out the cookie, marbles, tug of war, squid game and hop starch(on glass bridge). The show is so detailed and has so many good ideas that I really over look the cliques, the plot armor and plot conveniences. The twist I have to say I saw coming because it's obvious, as I watch so many movies I saw many things coming. And I love the music score, the best I've heard in a while. The editing so top notch, the violence is not that bad, everyone complaining hasn't watched Saw. This is funny and it's not in bad spirit tbh, like it has meaning. And the acting of you go from English over the Korean actors to subtitles is pretty good. I like how unique this show is even tho I've seen Hunger games and Battle royal and Saw. This is the best out of them, the child games they play is hilarious and I love it all, I didn't see what was coming but I wanted Tag or Red rover or spear the queer lmao. But this show is so heart warming so energized and so horror I like it a lot. I'll give it a B+, the only bad thing is sometimes some of the subplots are nonsense and the cop is annoying, and the VIPs suck ass. But beside that I love this show. Watch it!!!"
1952,Squid Game,"My God the actors who potrayed the VIP people cannot act. I cringed everytime they said a line. It felt like they were just reading them. Even the intonation was off. It was like when we were kids and had to read a play in class and we exagerated the intonation. Terrible, just awful."
1953,Squid Game,"I don't usually review, but when I do, It is really really good."
1954,Squid Game,"I feel like the show's overrated. There were too many holes in the story IMO. First of all, does the battery on that officer's phone ever run out? Secondly, how do people go missing (and not just one, but more than 400 each time) and nobody finds out anything? And they have been running the games for years now, so, it is pretty unrealistic. In addition, don't people get flagged for having all that money suddenly in their bank accounts? However, the overall idea of show was something new and exciting. It is worth watching, but there are far better shows out there."
1955,Squid Game,Most overrarted show none of games are interesting . U can understand this movie playing game on mobile. Emotional scenes are impactless. None of character will attach or attract you. Dont know how it became most watched show on netflix.
1956,Squid Game,Omg ! A Must watch! First episode is Fantastic! Do not miss it. Absolute Gore fun. Delivers what it promises!! Man I don't usually comment but this is Epic!
1957,Squid Game,"This series reminded me of Alice in Borderland which some web pages suggest you to watch after finishing this series. I have never written a review about Alice in Borderland by i am writing about this since its was better than the Japanese series which was based on manga and anime (they didn't finish the anime though).Now back to this series. Personally i am skeptic to Korean shows since i watch only western Hollywood movies and series but i gotta say here the Koreans surpassed the Americans way better just as they did with Oldboy(2001) which was copied by Hollywood in Oldboy(2013) which stars Josh Brolin (the guy wtho plays Thanos) and with the movie Miracle in Cell Number 7 that the Turkish stole and made a Netflix movie of their own.I call it the dream of all horror fans since every horror fan likes movies like Nine Dead, The Unknown, Saw 2, The Killing Room, Fermats Room, Cube, FunHouse, The Platform and most importantly the movie Would You Rather (2012).Its the same like Would You Rather with characters who suffer from debts and have desperate ways of living along with the lack of the opportunities to breakthrough and pay their debts which if they do not they risk their internal organs. The beauty of the show is that the participants participate willingly in the deadly contests. No one forces them to do but they do it with their own free will. Its more elaborted than Would You Rather when we get to see the management, the ranks of the guards and the officials, how the system works etc....
If you like these kinds of horror shows and you are addicted to them there is no better one than this."
1958,Squid Game,"I watched this show in the original language of Korean with English subtitles.I'm writing this review after watching the first seven shows, because it's very interesting. One big thing I like in shows is morality. Everyone has morals, and they differ in each individual. I enjoy Star Trek because of the focus on morals. Same thing with The Orville. This show is no exception.One important thing regarding morality is that every single character is there by their own free will and choice. This is important, even though the creators of the games didn't give any details as to what the games would be.Spoilers: The first game involved a deadly game of Red Light, Green Light. Unlike the original game, players caught moving on a red light were shot. The creators used technology to detect movement. Upon realizing the deadly aspect, most players panicked and tried to leave but ended up shot due to being caught moving.What got the players to come was potential prize money. Each eliminated player added money to the pot.After the first game, some players remaining didn't want to continue, even after seeing the amount of prize money they were playing for. Players signed a contract involving three clauses, one of which was the games would stop if the majority wanted to stop. Therefore, the game's creators put it to a vote. They barely reached a majority, the games ended, and they dropped off the remaining players in different locations.However, the games would continue if the majority of the players returned. The game's creators enticed players to return and, eventually, all but about 10 to 20 people came back.I don't want to get too detailed regarding the plot, but the point of this review is the morals. My thinking changed during the course of the show.While watching the first game, I'm thinking that I would be playing very carefully after watching the first person getting shot, so I wouldn't die. I'm hoping I wouldn't get too scared and freeze completely.For the second game, I don't know if I would have passed. I might be too scared to try, or I would be too careful and run out of time. Each game had a time limit, and they shot any remaining players that didn't complete it.For the third game and even during the riot, I didn't think about what I would do in their situation. I probably would have tried to find some place to hide to avoid others from attacking.For game four, this opens so many possibilities. Would I sacrifice myself for the other to move on, or would I sincerely try to beat the other? What game would I choose? Of course, it would depend on who my partner was. Also, would I to trick the other, so I would survive and move on? I probably wouldn't be able to live with that guilt for the rest of my life.One character went against his wife and couldn't get over the fact that he won. He wanted to end the games and tried to get players to join him. One character pointed out that ending the game would make his wife's sacrifice pointless. I was thinking along those lines, too.For game five, the first thing I would do is try to tell the difference between the two glass panes. One of the later players ended up doing that. The host turned out the lights to remove the advantage.Many players during game five got scared and hesitated regarding deciding which glass pane to choose. It was a 50/50 shot, and the player would fall to their death if wrong. There was a time limit involved. When one player sat on one of the glass panes and started praying, I got the feeling that the player behind should push him.In summary, this show got my attention and my interest. I was even cheering for some of the characters, and I disliked a couple. The morality aspect is the most interesting part of the game, and the show even surprised me on more than one occasion. The show isn't for everyone due to gore, profanity, some suggestive dialogue, one somewhat detailed sex scene, another scene where a guy tries to get another guy to go down on him, and one scene where naked women appear as furniture."
1959,Squid Game,"Given the hype of this series, I caved and started watching it. I've seen Alice in Borderland before and loved that one. Squid Game feels a little like a bit of copy and mix of different already existing content, they even use the Battle Royal music to announce games :D That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this series, it was good but quite slow and so extremely predictable. Be it that I'm used to watching thrillers and horror movies, but I wasn't really surprised by any of the revelations.I'd be happy if it finishes here, anything else would just be a repetition anyway.Good watch if you're bored. Does it live up to the hype? Definitely not, no idea why it's being so overhyped."
1960,Squid Game,"I really like Squid Games. Well written and the plot wasn't over the top b/c it makes you think about your own life. It was worth the binge; however, the ending was a little flat to me. And if there is a second season, I believe it would ruin it...pretty hard act to follow."
1961,Squid Game,"One the worst shows that i've watched in recent times, if possible don't watch, it's a waste of time, the plot character is literally walking down the road in goody shoes."
1962,Squid Game,"I'm not sure why nobody talks about this but this series is heavily inspired by the Japanese anime Kaiji though Kaiji is much better, smarter, and in full 2 seasons. So if you liked one show you will like the other."
1963,Squid Game,"This series is literally overhyped. The story was predictable. The acting was decent. The more you watch it, the more it starts to get boring. Started off well but has a huge decline once the series starts progressing.I don't understand why people are praising this series. One can even skip it and not worry about missing a lot.People don't have their own opinion these days. If their friends like something then they gotta praise it as well and that's what happened to this series. Some people started praising it and everyone followed the train.Don't waste your time on this. Better move on and watch something else."
1964,Squid Game,Loved it. Hooked from the start. Well done! Hope there is a season 2!
1965,Squid Game,"Too bad Chapelle wasn't in the Squid GameViolence way to high when involving to many kids games and cartoon looking charactersReally love Korean Series The Strange, Black, THE abyss and moreDidn't finish this one less real than the demon and spirit world Korean series."
1966,Squid Game,"A mix of Hunger Games, Parasite, Hostel and Saw.It shows how human nature really is."
1967,Squid Game,"Great series, this is for me one of must-watch series.I only don't like the end, the last five minutes didn't have to happen, it should end with his entering in the plain and that would be enough."
1968,Squid Game,"We've seen every element of this before. My wife and I sat here predicting how every single scene would play out. The acting, while carried by a few good performances, was uninspiring and the lack of character development made it hard to care for the fates of anyone in the show. More enjoyment came from retranslating the poor subtitles than actually following the story."
1969,Squid Game,"The main character cannot act to save his life. I found myself not caring for most of the characters, so the emotional scenes and the supposed suspense during the games fell flat.I was hoping for some inventive games, but that wasn't the concept I suppose.I've watched a lot of terrible netflix shows, but I couldn't even finish this one. I stopped before the VIP episode, which people seems to be very angry about, so I don't count that towards my rating of 3 stars.I honestly don't understand how some people can rate this 9/10. I get 10/10, because some people get excited easily and want to improve the score of a show they like, but 8 or 9/10 seems to suggest that it's one of the better shows of the year, and that those people actually thought about their ratings. I don't get it, man."
1970,Squid Game,"I really don't understand the high ratings and all the media hype. Very shallow , simple and predictable storyline, horrible (over) acting (with the exception of Jung Hoyoen) and too many loose ends. Camera work is average at best and props are a joke. This could well have been a school project for students. From all the fuzz in the media I had expected much more."
1971,Squid Game,"Please value your life...
If there are any future seasons, i will not fool myself again.Believe me or not? Ok, it is up to you, but, if you watched the series and didn't love it, please like this review, otherwise..."
1972,Squid Game,"It has been a while since I have felt so obsessive about a show, but Squid Games is legit. A raw and real portrayal of human emotion at its best, worst, and everything in between. I found myself laughing, physically yelling at the tv, and crying all within the span of a single episode. The acting is just outstanding, and it was refreshing to watch something so truly unique. Highly recommend."
1973,Squid Game,"The idea is somewhat interesting but has many unrealistic elements. Yes, it is a fiction, but even in a fiction people's reactions must be realistic. You can watch the show if you have nothing better to do."
1974,Squid Game,It's a well done version of stories and movies we've seen a million times before. Nothing groundbreaking but good for what it is.
1975,Squid Game,Wife and I really enjoyed the series. The storyline and acting was great.The only thing I would fault it on is the foreigners in the show. The Korean actors were top notch and believable.... while the vips just seemed like they found random foreigners in Seoul to play the characters. Even Abi seemed a bit strange at times.
1976,Squid Game,"I loved this show!! I wish I could forget it and just watch it for the first time again! It stays in your mind for a while, the concept was insane and cruel.. The manipulation was the real game! They knew exactly how the instincts of the players will work each time.I felt sorry for like everyone in the finale, but I liked the way he fixed the ""family issues"" with the little boy and the old lady!"
1977,Squid Game,"After ""Parasite"" this is yet another """"emperors new clothes"" kind of movie, I cannot understand what was the hype in this move.The story was filled with many loopholes and characters lacked any depth. After Episode 4 I mostly fast forwarded the episodes to get to the end to know what was this all about. The ending turned out to be even worse.Given the secrecy and illegality of the game I firstly could not understand how could they allow to let go of people and bring them back without risking leakage of information. Then I could not fathom how easy it was for someone to break in into the game and as well carry phones and knives.The central character seemed to be the most confused person. He was impervious when 100s of people around him were getting killed but suddenly becomes judgmental about the game towards the end. What was he expecting? The others were happily forging relationships despite knowing only 1 would survive and appear to be surprised when they were on the losing side."
1978,Squid Game,"Wow! Just WOW! Just when i was losing hope with some of the garbage thats produced these days comes this absolute sky rocket! The squid games is as close to tv show perfection as it gets. Original clever story, great characters, visually stunning and some great twists.Im literally obsessed with how stunning the sets are and how genius but simple the story is.This show will be one of those shows which will be getting repeatedly copied, from things like red light green light to the stunning original costumes of the soldiers and the front man.This literally is and will be an all time classic."
1979,Squid Game,"Production quality is good, but i dont why people are ccomparing this with some masterpieces like breaking bad, prison break etc. I must this could be the most overated tv show ever."
1980,Squid Game,I'm on episode 5 and I'm considering giving up on the show. It's obviously not my cup of tea but I can't see how this many people like it. It's mediocre at best. I especially hate the character interaction. It's so unrealistic. There are many plot holes already.
1981,Squid Game,Good show liked the plot and the violence. Lee byung hun is great as frontman and Lee jung Jae while a good actor is kind of annoying as Seong gi hun. Overall great but my main criticism is that there is too many Asians I can't really tell sometimes which characters are which cause they all look the same.8/10.
1982,Squid Game,"I've personally found the majority of Netflix's original content to be mediocre or uninteresting. Stranger Things was the last series that left a big impression on me (at least the first season lol). Now Squid Game's done it.A+ storytelling, character development, cinematography, set design, costume design, acting, writing, editing. It was so well done. I was pulled in from the start and invested in it as though it was all real. It's top tier entertainment, and it should be no surprise to anyone because of how well it's doing in both the US and the rest of the world. If it were as bad as other reviews might say, it wouldn't be getting so much social media buzz and definitely wouldn't be closing in as the most streamed Netflix series of all time. It's just that good. Not to discredit more critical reviews, but they're subjective. Nothings ever for everyone. But Squid Game has proven to be for most with its huge popularity.The credit for this show is the director/writer. He's a genius and had a lot of weight on him with making this, and I'm so glad Netflix picked his idea up after a decade of not finding anyone to help make this show. I watched this with my friend, and I'll be watching again with my family if they decide to see it too.I watched the Korean audio with English subtitles, and from what I've been seeing online, that's been the best way to watch it. It started playing automatically in English dub, and my friend and I were like ""ehhh no"" when we heard it. So glad we changed it.I can't wait to see a second season."
1983,Squid Game,"Just watch it. No hesitation. BINGED WATCHED IT IN ONE GO! I want moreeeee! Didn't know, how this would take me for an emotional/thrilling/suspense / unexpected roller coaster."
1984,Squid Game,"From episode to episode, the only real variable is the game that will be played before mass murder takes place. This story could/should have been over by episode 3."
1985,Squid Game,"I dont know how it happend, but a couple of days ago i was memorising my childhood (thats not happening a lot). And then i had a strong memory about this childhood game we used to play as kids in the neighborhood. And guess what? That game was the 1st game those players in this tv show played (i dont remember its name in a foreign language), the one they needed to freeze after the count stop... So i was realy amazed by finding this great tv show. Its seriously shown how our mind worked as kids and how we been more active as kids- as shown Through all the games in this amazing tv show. So yes its a big 10/10 for me.Recommended to any human being on this earth."
1986,Squid Game,Netflix always grab the bang on shows. This one is at another level.Fun fact:- The director struggled for almost 10yrs to publish this drama....
1987,Squid Game,"Netflix always grabs bang on shows, and this one is another level i watched earlier but shoked yet and thinking about the series....
Fun fact:- The director struggled for almost 10 years to publish this drama...."
1988,Squid Game,"As another review says, the VIPs acting is not bad. The only reason native English speakers find it bad is because they speak very slowly and clear, as the show is not intended for English speakers.I usually check reviews on FilmAffinity, (the Spanish version) and literally no one there was talking about how bad the VIPs were. So, for Spanish speakers, the acting doesn't seem bad. It is as simple as that.As for the show, it is a great show. I strongly recommend watching it.Maybe not a 10/10 as that is reserved for films that changed my life, but definitely a 8/10.It is a great metaphor of capitalism and how our society forces people into extreme situations."
1989,Squid Game,"Just don't count on cops for real, when comes to a situation like this. They get paid monthly and they are hired by the goverment. They don't know you. Count on yourself and your community which is organic. Asians need to grow up and seek for help from anything other than a strong government."
1990,Squid Game,"It is interesting that nobody figured out a good strategy for the glass bridge game. The ""firm glass"" was firm enough for two people. How about forming supporting chain, where the front competitor steps on the glass backwards, while holding hands of a person behind, who is also secured by holding from the person behind him...The story of policeman looking for his brother did not impact the faith of competitors, but he was kept alive, probably for the season 2.I liked the movie ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" more. I have no desire to watch the season two."
1991,Squid Game,"The concept of some broke people playing games for their lifes has been done in asian media for like 40 years. While this show has one great episode (the one with marbles) and some good scenes, much of it was not thrilling at all. And the ending was kinda silly (the haircut!).The concept has been executed the best with the Anime Kaiji 15 years ago, super thrilling. Would recommend watching this instead."
1992,Squid Game,"I don't write comments on movies and series ... although I've watched a lot of them ... Everyone praised this one, I thought I'll give a chance to watch it ... I haven't watched much nonsense for a long time, Breaking bad is a masterpiece for this one. Total disappointment."
1993,Squid Game,"Seriously. All things considered, they're a pretty small and self-contained part. The main characters were brilliant in their roles. I guess good actors figured that having parts where they're wearing masks the whole time wouldn't get them much exposure. The pacing and character development were superb."
1994,Squid Game,"The story is great and has so much potential, but I just don't understand why they would give big clues about the ending plot in the middle of the season, although they still managed to put plots in each episode. The ending could be better but it's 100% worth watching and I'm already waiting for the second season lol."
1995,Squid Game,"Loved every minute, couldn't stop watching!They did a great job in making it feel more ""realistic"" and not like SAW or some other classic horror/thriller movie."
1996,Squid Game,"As a mother, I recommend especially young people to stay away from this series, it is a very harmful series even for an adult with normal psychology, the age group is +18 and the suicidal tendency is increasing in the young people who follow it, if you care about your child, do not allow watch it."
1997,Squid Game,Generic story and poor acting. I don't understand hype for this since this is just another garbage battle royal show. There are a ton of similar shows like this.
1998,Squid Game,"In this documentary, illuminati, whatever you call them, satan worshipers, tell us without any doubt what they like to do, how they make fun, and how they spend money. It is really no wonder Netflix again push this wicked conent, so therefore in this ""masterpiece"" documentary you can see a lot of unavoidable violence. You know there is 2 ways ppl die in movies. In normal movies ppl die and story continue. In movies made by devil worshipers every death is very well visually prepresented, blood everywhere, brains, inside of human body and stuff, all that smartly placed in a way you cant just look away like normal human being would do, bc you do not enjoy violence like they want you to. Also this documentary goes great with nowdays panic about pandemic, ppl are masked - unknown, just like in real life. Thats how they see ppl and you, like items, spendable, literally same worth as animals - nothing to them. All that you can see in very well in this documentary."
1999,Squid Game,"It is good to watch. However, actors overplayed their roles. The plot is another Hunger Games.It is well done in terms of photography. And entertained."
2000,Squid Game,"Everyone talking about it, So I just wanted to try one episode. But I finished just one night. I could not sleep. I think this is best Netflix show ever."
2001,Squid Game,Its far from bad and definitely worth watching but some scenes that the show wants you to take seriously are sometimes cringe because of the overacting. Still worth watching its good.
2002,Squid Game,Gi-Hun is played by Lee Jung-Jae not my Greg Chun.Kindly edit the cast.
2003,Squid Game,"The series is decent, I really liked, it wasn't amazing, but it was cool watching, I would give it a 7. However, the last episode is so bad that it weakens the hole plot, it destroys any chance of rating above 5."
2004,Squid Game,"Ok....i get it the hype its incredible...
Theres a lot of time when im watching the drama, i've asked my self what would happened if a Japanese production team was behind all of this...Dont get the wrong idea, the drama's story line itself is fantastic, the characters development between each others is superb..... but...
The games they play... its kinda boring isnt?Ok i get it... its based on a Korean childhood tradition games...but if you wanna make it a between life and death situation ish kinda games....games like that...its just boring as hellPersonally, the only time where i genuinely felt fear for the characters is when they're playing the glass platform games and the tug of war...
It really shows us they are genuinely fear for their live if they've made a wrong step they will DIE...If the games have a certain skills to win it...well its boring as hell...
IF you play a game like paper rock scissors, heads or tails, or the game with a little bit luck includes in the game they're playing... that would be 10times better than cutting a piece of sugar candy...because you'll never know how its gonna turn out...Each of them are considered losers in the real world and they came back for a second time trying to win the money for them self...but no...everyone is being good to one another, well apart for the fat man...Consider they all came back for the second time, they all knew if they keep playing some will die but they all need the money, It only make sense if the characters betray each others trying to win the game for themselves other than just being scammed or getting lied like ONLY in the marbles gamesWhy did i mention about Japanese director instead of a Korean one? Well... this genre has always been my favourite since long time ago and the Japanese really know what they're up to.Go watch an Animie call Kaiji, you'll understands the standard for this particular genre...The betrayal the urge of wanna get out alive... i felt it all when watching the Animie...
but in squid game? Well... not so much... almost nothing if im being honest."
2005,Squid Game,"We can't deny the fact that this series is pretty much predictable, and the notion that the villain & VIP's were randomly selected, however; I don't regret watching it cz of the thrilling plots and the good developing of characters."
2006,Squid Game,I really enjoyed the show but there was too much violence it's disturbing.
2007,Squid Game,"My first Korean TV series I have seen all episodes. Wao I love it like there are violence scenes that go over the border, and good stories of rich and poor, what money do to people in difficult times in life."
2008,Squid Game,Enjoyable show. Wish the translation was more accurate however.
2009,Squid Game,"After all the hype this series caused I finally decided to watch it and honestly I enjoyed the beginning of it up until maybe the 6th episode. The games started to become boring and meaningless and the VIPs were the worst thing ever! Bad acting and awful dialogue, no one talks like that in real life, they had so much potential but it was wasted. The ending was disappointing, okay number 001 was the mastermind but that's it?! Really! And the main guy who won bothered me to no end, he was depressed and losing it over all the lives lost because of this game, blaming the rich for the game when in reality the poor enabled this too, the blame isn't solitary! And he refused to do anything or help anyone with the money for a whole year! He was a loser with no ambition before the squid game and chose to stay that way after it! He could've helped so many people, instead he sat in a corner feeling sorry for himself for a whole year, pathetic! Then when he pulls himself together (red hair and all) he backtracks at the last minute and decides oh I'm gonna undo all my character development and do the stupid impulsive thing instead! What a disappointment truly, again this had so much wasted potential, it could have been something truly mind blowing."
2010,Squid Game,"Everything is good but the plot, the game and character development. It might seem fresh for non survival or Korean show watchers, but surely it didn't do any sides good whether if it's the survival or the psychological part. Squid Game is a good show for entertaining but not even that close to what people are hyping it as for sure."
2011,Squid Game,"Squid game was really good, beyond my expactations. However, VIPs part and final was so cheesy! You shound watch behind the scenes video and see that most places, they were real!"
2012,Squid Game,"INDIRECT SPOILERSThis show was definitely overhyped but there were some incredible moments (basically all of which are the games themselves). The twist at the end is definitely an interesting concept but doesn't really make sense and leaves a lot of massive plot holes. The games themselves are some of the most enjoyable scenes of television I've watched in a while, but outside of them there isn't too much excitement. The show is smart but not clever, it's predictable but not in a boring way but an exciting way for predicting something right, but later it's revealed you were actually not right. Very cool show but the finale is easily the worst episode and the episode before it feels like mostly filler."
2013,Squid Game,"The first season of Squid Game ended poorly for two reasons
1. Almost all participants were killed
2- The last part ended with a normal fight with a knife
While it could have ended with an interesting and surprising intellectual contest
This series could have been much better."
2014,Squid Game,"It is one of the best shows that I have ever seen in my life. Interesting plot, great acting etc."
2015,Squid Game,Honestly it's not a bad show but I could see things happen before they happened nothing really shocked me in that factor i'd say its a good show to binge but I don't think it was as great as everyone claimed it to be considering its not an original concept but to each their own.
2016,Squid Game,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable and binge worthy series although..The VIP acting is horrendous, really spoils what was great acting up until then.Also, don't bother watching with subtitles. They are so far off you'd be as well guessing what's being said in Korean and you'd still be better off.All said and done though. Great watch regardless and a series not to be missed out on, even if only for the memes on social media..."
2017,Squid Game,"I was very much enjoying this show and one of my favourite characters is Sae-byeok. Her scene with Ji-yeong who gave up her marbles for her in episode 6 was by far the most emotional scene for me. Throughout the show, she was portrayed as a cold and emotionless girl, right up until that scene when she finally broke.Even though I loved her character, I already knew she wasn't going to make it till the end. But a character like her deserves an impactful ending and that was all I wanted for her. However, the way she got injured and eventually died was total BS for me.Before you come at me by saying that I'm too emotionally invested, read what I have to say next.In episode 7, the remaining players go through a bridge of glass. They choose between 2 types of glasses to step on: Regular glass and Tempered glass. Many of them made missteps and fell and the glass broke. Towards the end of the episode, we were left with 3. When the game ended, the glass bridge shatters and Sae-byeok gets stabbed with a shard.If you playback at the scene where the glass shatters, you'll see the huge error made where the glass that should have already been shattered by the players were shattered again. This HUGE error caused me to lose all immersion in the show.Furthermore, up till this point, all injuries to players were made by other players. Their policy was that all players should be given equal chance to succeed. So what was the point in shattering the bridge and injuring the players?Episode 7 had some poor decision making in terms of writing and visuals. From then on, it was hard for me to enjoy the last 2 episodes."
2018,Squid Game,"Your eyes will stick to the series hours by hours. I cried, laughed, and feared at the same time. K-drama is always worth watching!"
2019,Squid Game,"One of the best series i have ever watched in my life (and i watched a lot!).However that VIP acting was the most rerrible acting i have ever seen in my life. Terrible.On the contrary everything else about the serieswas top notch quality. Acting? 10. Screenplay? 10 Director? 10 Camera angles? 10
Game rooms? 10/10."
2020,Squid Game,"The series starts quite well, giving me hope, but immediately ends up in a bunch of commonplaces and boring dialogues.There is much better to watch out there.."
2021,Squid Game,"1. Storyline based on ""equality within the game which can not be found in the real world"", yet there is a bunch of stuff that makes the players start on unequal foot caused by the game itself. One of the candidates getting hit by glass from the blown bridge, many random pre selections and much more hindering factors making it more based on randomness rather than equality. At the end they also stray from this principle which they laid out so abruptly and went for the sensational card where ""they're just race horses for the enjoyment of the rich"". Just very strange and random.2. Not sure if anyone noticed but during the 5th game with the glass bridge while candidates were on the bridge glass was just randomly repaired again after every candidate, until multiple people were on the bridge then it stayed broken leaving another equality but also just a technical error from the show, near the end aswell while all candidates are on the bridge one of the first glasses which was repaired was broken again after. If you pay attention during the scene of the game you'll see this is just really odd and inconsistent.3. The detective's brother who is the frontman only recently dissapeared, but won ages ago and now has been frontman for multiple games, how does this make sense?4. They started out very interestingly and the principles of the show had potential, but they just dissapeared and changed in the middle of the show. The ending was also just completely random and felt like a waste, only functioned to setup a second season, if they had made it a one season mini series building on the principles they started with, this could've been a banger.5. VIP actors, no words.6. The main roles were great though, so were the actors.7. The last game and fight was very forced and weird, alot of predictability near the end.8. The Jung Ho-yeon & Yooomee Lee dynamic was so good."
2022,Squid Game,"Thb, I really liked this series. Full of thrilled. Enjoyed every episode of the season."
2023,Squid Game,"Way better than Hunger Games. Great story, actors, and moral choices and animal instincts of humans."
2024,Squid Game,"I generally don't watch such violent entertainment but my son recommended this to me & I got hooked. Go figure, huh? Look, it's an interesting story, twists, turns, deceit & treachery all the way. But it's gory & at times perverse. Enjoy?"
2025,Squid Game,"The concept and plot is good, I'm not saying it's rare and not hv seen in any movie/series before but the masks, games, game rules, ect are well written.But when it comes to acting, you'll notice sometime chachters are behaving too unnatural, maybe i felt it bcz of i watched it in English (Original language is Korian) i also tried in Hindi but it was far worse.I was going to give it 6 stars, but last episode was good so 7 star for dat."
2026,Squid Game,"This is what Takeshi's Castle would have been if Sam Peckinpah or Quentin Tarantino had been in charge. An entertaining concept, with loads of bloodshed. What else do you need?"
2027,Squid Game,One of the best Korean series I have watched and loved every aspect of the show!. All the actors did exceptionally well. Eagerly waiting for another Season!
2028,Squid Game,We didn't need to see foreign vip actors that wasn't necessary.
2029,Squid Game,"One of the best K Netflix series I've seen in recent years. The plot, cinematography, and acting (with the exception of some masked caucasians in the end) was superb. Several A-list actors were in this show and the cameos by them were very well woven into the story. Looking forward to a season 2."
2030,Squid Game,"The beginning of the series is very attractive and breathtaking. To a large extent it makes you follow. In the end, with a little thought, you will find many mistakes and problems in the film, which are the result of not paying attention to the small points of the film."
2031,Squid Game,"Good series with good actors. A little bit lefty , but the game makes the series more dynamic. Like it. Looking forward to the second series. The music from the first game is still buzzing in my head."
2032,Squid Game,"Honestly, I did not find the point of anything. The games made no sense, killing the people made no sense, the motive behind the games made no sense and the cherry on the cake were the VIPs! 😂 Absolutely hilarious. If you want to watch a dystopian society then the first hunger hames and the first book maze runner are pretty decent comparatively. But this did not work for me. I need to watch something really nice to chance my mood."
2033,Squid Game,Every one hating on the vip's i mean the did a pretty job their cringe humor is a type u. Will see among rich the bad lines mad them more interesting.
2034,Squid Game,"Squid Game is absolutely worth the watch. It is fascinating, exciting and at times moving. The first and currently only season is highly suited for a proper binging session, as the conclusion of each episode will leave you wondering what will happen next, and where all of this will ultimately go. Sadly, the pay-off is not as grand as we are led to believe.The visual presentation of Squid Game is wonderfully surreal. Endless staircases, pastel colors and trick doors make the entrance to the game area seem like a demented funhouse designed by M. C. Escher. The facility is guarded by ominous masked figures in bright pink jumpsuits, and the game areas themselves are nightmarish visions of children's playgrounds. This gives the entire series an uncanny, oppressive atmosphere throughout all nine episodes. In terms of set design, costume design and overall visual presentation, Squid Game could not have done much better.However, the narrative that unfolds against this otherworldly backdrop is not always as coherent or fleshed-out as the perfectly composed environments would suggest.Squid Game is a variation of the concept of a 'death game', which has been seen many times before in productions such as Running Man and Hunger Games.Series director and writer Hwang Dong-hyuk adds variation to this familiar concept by emphasizing the voluntary nature of the game: each contestant has to apply themselves in order to join the game, and even after they have been sedated and kidnapped to the island where the games are to take place, they are given ample opportunity to leave and return to their normal lives.The game rules even include the option to halt the games at any time, should a majority of the contestants vote to do so. In episode 2, this is exactly what ends up happening. The episode then goes on to try and establish that, despite the horrors of these murderous children's games, the normal lives of the participants are so dire and hopeless that they cannot but conclude that game is the lesser of two evils, and by the end of the episode, 93% of the original surviving players have returned to continue the game. This is an impossible idea to sell to an audience, even when the pool of contestants is supposed to consist of the country's most desperate and indebted.Fantastical premise aside, the way the actual games play out will leave you with sweaty palms more than once. In addition to its presentation, another strong point of the series is feeding us information and letting us try and puzzle it together before feeding us answers. The behavior and motivation of certain characters and even major plot points can be figured out well in advance if you know what to look for and how to piece it all together. This adds an extra layer of tension to the already nerve-wrecking death games.Although the series eventually goes out of its way to answer some of the most pressing questions, there is occasional room for speculation. Was Sang Woo a humble man who got corrupted by his desperation to win the game, only to find back his humanity at the very end? Or was he a cold and calculating cutthroat who was planning to abuse the trust of others from the get-go, ultimately taking his own life simply because he refused to go back to his miserable life?Squid Game could have benefitted from leaving more of such questions open to the interpretation of the viewer. The most glaring example of this is the mystery surrounding the VIPs who view and fund these games, which was decisively shattered by the absolutely horrid actors who played them, clumsily delivering dialogue so juvenile that you couldn't get away with it in a Call of Duty voice lobby.Similarly, the big reveal at the end, that the old man was the mastermind behind it all, might have been best left to fan speculation. Not only does this Scooby Doo-like villain reveal feel cheap, predictable and too on-the-nose, but when the character is asked about his motivation for the game, the answer reveals how downright shallow the plot can be on occasions. The old man, who is on his deathbed, reveals that the game was put together to provide excitement to himself and his exorbitantly rich friends. Perverted elites paying to see poor, desperate people die for their own twisted entertainment was my first guess upon learning the show's premise, and it was truly disappointing to see that my surface-level observation proved to be all there was to it.That all being said, most of the acting, pacing and visualization of Squid Game do carry the series to great heights. When it's good, it really is good. Particular praise has to go to HoYeon Jung. In what is reportedly her major acting debut, she excellently portrays Kang Sae-byeok, who is perhaps one of the only truly likeable characters playing the game, as she is one of the few contestants not stupid, a backstabber or both. The North Korean defector, who hopes to win the money to help her mother, who still lives in her home country, and her orphaned brother. Sae-byeok wears her cold, almost ruthless disposition as her armor, but ultimately shows more humanity than most of the other contestants, even breaking down completely when her opponent in the marble game throws the match to guarantee Sae-byeok's survival. These shifts in her personality, both sudden and gradual, are given immense weight by the actress's performance, and it's in moments like these that the series truly shines.There can be little doubt that Squid Game is an entertaining, addictive watch. Ultimately though, its inconsistency does end up harming it. The series might hit a home run in one area, but then completely drop the ball in the next. As a viewer, you are left wondering where it all goes, trusting that all these plot points which the creators dangle in front of you will ultimately pay off. In the end, the series is like the giant piggy bank full of money that perpetually hovers over the contestants' heads in the sleeping area. After the violence is over and the dust settles, you get what you expected, but you're still left with a feeling of emptiness."
2035,Squid Game,"Good idea, but poor, shallow acting and very annoying characters. The police man was an exception, though. Lots of talking and little action. Easy to guess some of the «surprising» turns in the plot."
2036,Squid Game,"This is so good it feels almost Shakespearean in its epicness. An intriguing tale of loss and hopelessness with the tantalizing possibility of having everything one wants... but at what cost.Life the game where there are winners and losers yet in the end, we all want the freedom of childhood innocence and play.To have the freedom from financial burden we have the memories of amazing moments in our childhood to escape to.But this review is really just a philosophical view of squid game. This series is exceptional. Just watch it."
2037,Squid Game,I never made a review before but this series is totally worth a review. I really like how it handles to make such great tension in every single episode! Totally worth-to-watch series!
2038,Squid Game,"Worthy to watch, suspense and thriller is peak. I have watched all episodes in a day without sleeping 😴 and make sure that you all get excitement."
2039,Squid Game,"At tug of war, eight groups of ten participated. Four groups won so 40 stayed alive and moved on to next level. The night before one of them who was a doctor was killed. So 39 participated this level during which they had to form groups of two. 19 groups were formed and one woman remained with no partner who was taken to the dorm. On this level every group could have just one winner so at the end there had to be 19 winners. 19 winners and the woman of no partner stayed alive. But the winner board read 17 not 20!!! I don't know why??!!"
2040,Squid Game,"Lead character not consistent, very naive and immature script and dialogue. I really don't know why it's a hit. I assume teens around the world are loving it from some odd reasons. Not watching season 2 for sure."
2041,Squid Game,"This is my first time writing a review on Imdb and i am only doing this because of this series.I have to say that it's one of the best series Netflix has brought to us so far. If i ever had the ability to forget everything and rewatch it, i would have done it.A really exciting and dramatic series at the same time. It almost made me cry at some point."
2042,Squid Game,Anyone who is bored of his/her life then please watch this show . If you are not happy with your life style then watch the life of the people who have lost everything in life and that's the same thing showed in this show and acting is so real . I just loved this show.
2043,Squid Game,Please remove all traces of the VIPs and you can get the 2 stars back.
2044,Squid Game,Far from perfect but still great. Watch with subtitles the English dubbing is very poor.
2045,Squid Game,"Better cast, script and plot than Borderland!Only downside- edge of the seat and non stop binging effect."
2046,Squid Game,"Didn't think much of it, don't understand how it's even trending still and if that has a shop based on the show. Baffles me the most people
fight over this in Paris lol."
2047,Squid Game,"Very good script and an original idea 💡
Acting was good
I didn't like the VIP persons and The ending a little bit
it doesn't need more seasons."
2048,Squid Game,"Honestly, I'm pretty squeamish and was hesitant to watch this series though my god only after 1 episode I was instantly hooked. Amazing cinamatografy and writing although it occasionally felt a little too gloomy (to a point it might seem a little too unrealistic) it was certainly one of the best shows I've watched in a long time. I can't emphasize enough that this show is a series worth watching. (Though only teens and up I genuinly think it would be traumatizing for a child to watch this)"
2049,Squid Game,Best show! The story is excruciating and the best one so far on my suspense k drama list. A must watch drama.
2050,Squid Game,"THIS is BY FAR the WORST ENDING I ever saw in my entire life,and trust me I watched a lot of movies and tv shows.... If you stop watching after episode 6 it is great show but after that it goes from bad to worse."
2051,Squid Game,I'm in the type of person that can normally get everything that's about to happen in a movie and or shop well they were parts of this where I was shocked maybe last second I would get it but anyways it was incredible regardless of how bad the VIPs act this is one of the best shows I've ever seen in my entire life absolutely incredible.
2052,Squid Game,"This tv show is incredible I really liked it !! But it's very hard !! But the tv show is good and funny, it's my fav at the moment omggg. She's violent and afraid shocked a lot of people but it's still a pretty pleasant story!! And it's not appropriate for children!!! But it's really cool to show this. I finished the tv show in just 4 days and I saw a lot of edit on tiktok about this series."
2053,Squid Game,"Definitely one of the best series i ever Seen, Specially Netflix original, i was very Tense Through all the episodes, this shows can keep up, The directing is excellent, the pictures amazing, Great story, this was my first Korean series, i was suppose that i can feel so close to every story, even my Culture is so far, in the end i guess the human pain and suffering are the same all over the world,"
2054,Squid Game,"Guys.How can this show even be hyped ?It's easily in my top 5 of the worst series I've ever watched. I'm totally not kidding. I wasted 9 hours of my life for this trash, just to understand why people like it. And I don't get it. It's bad. It's more than bad. It's boring, it's predictable.And I'm not even talking yet about the absolute ridiculous acting.100% trash - at least for people with a little claim in good series. Trust me..."
2055,Squid Game,"Such a blatant rip off. Just watch the anime or read the manga, u will get it. The plot, the MC all remain the same. They just tweeked the events a bit to call it ""squid game"" and not ""kaiji ultimate warrior: live action adaptation"". Netflix has launched many anime adaptation, but all of them have failed every single time - Erased, Bleach, Death Note(why??), because in each of them they changed the story, skipped events and trashed the anime. Now they have done the same thing by just changing the name of the adaptation. Hats off to the brilliant plagiarisers of Netflix, may your dumb and clueless customers yield you tons of profit."
2056,Squid Game,"This is definitely one of the best series I've watched and you got to give cred to the korean actors, but I'm sorry the V. I. P actors... even though the try their best the whole feeling dies a bit on that episode, as well as at the beginning when the kids play squidgame the shirt gets ripped and in the next scene it's fully normal that felt kinda off, but that detail could have been a missunderstanding by me."
2057,Squid Game,"Visually appealing and memorable design, nice sets
Not ""original"" or ""A new"" in the long established death game/survival genre. ""drew inspiration"" by copy-pasting and tweaking some parts from different shows/mangas like kaiji (gambler &the glass numbered game) and liar game and made it its own.Simple and appealing approach to be marketable to the mainstreamtakeaway: would probably remember it as the ""shapes"" and ""in red suits cooking in aprons"" ""suit red blue envelope at train station"" ""playground painted wall"" show etc =so, visuals. But the characters or their backstories not so much, it would be broadly ""in the death game genre"" around the same time jp ver of cube comes out 2021/2022."
2058,Squid Game,"This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout.But once the mystery fades, we see a pretty shallow set-up. Promising character development ultimately does not hold up, with some making seemingly inexplicable (but plot advancing) decisions. Other supporting characters have absolutely no-depth at all to the point of being gratingly inhuman. Other reviewers compare it to anime/cartoon. I agree.In the end, there are enough open questions to support a second season but unfortunately not enough resolution in the first season to feel we really got the payoff we needed for putting up with all that violence."
2059,Squid Game,"This series is the prime example of the most prevalent problem in the Korean entertainment industry as a whole, tho I can argue the same for A LOT MORE.It is the simple: Insane budget for marketing and enormous effort for the outside coat of paint(which is in no way bad) but not nearly enough care for the actual content.Like seriously, the protagonist is just horribly writen in general. From start to finish, everything. If you view him through the Asian lens and especially regards to ethics, it gets even worse. You can clearly see how they try to make him a flawed character that would grow out of his bad habits but thanks to terrible ways of handling, he came of as simultaneously UNLIKABLE and FAKE. His introduction is horrible and his ""development"" is so illogical that erasing the attempt of the writers from your memory is much easier than acknowledging it and forcefully thinking ""At least they tried"".If the protagonist is that bad, you can imagine how the rest of the cast is handled. Basically just walking tropes that every survival game has with little to no meaningful gimmick attached, yet still badly presented.The games are just real life ones teleported into the show's world with a single additional rule of ""Losing means death"". While it works in favor of mass appeal and excite the ""what if I was there"" curiosity, the thrill fades fairly quickly due to the simplicity, not helped by the fact that the methods to gain advantages in them are all too well known as well, maybe with the exception of the first. In case those aren't bad enough, the amount of luck occurred to pull the protagonist out of trouble is enough to win the lottery for life.Yet, as I laid out at the beginning, this show is beautiful. From the set design and vfx to the acting, very few mishandles, tho are pretty glaring when they do occur. But overall, incredible. Wish they gave that level of attention to the script as well.In short, gorgeous look, empty soul."
2060,Squid Game,"This is one of the best show i've ever seen in my entire life.And the best show of the year for sure, and by far, i can't wait for season 2.You can go and watch it eyes closed !"
2061,Squid Game,"For someone who has seen Alice in Borderland and loved it, I see this series as a more mature and rawer version, without fantasies.It was the first Korean series I saw and now I'm looking for more."
2062,Squid Game,"Premise of the story was common: a man in debt in need of a way out. However, the way he was given a lifeline was innovative and different. Beautiful series apart from the VIPs and the cast was soo good."
2063,Squid Game,"Really great series. Different, although it reminds me a ""3%"" it is still different enough. I watched it quite fast, good actors. The only negative is the end - last part, not sure if it was as good as expected till then... it was like.. they just really want to prepare for 2.series :/ it was still surprising but not satisfying. Worth of watching !"
2064,Squid Game,"Pure garbage. Kids are already imitating this horrible thing with dangerous consequences in real life. Sick idea of a TV show. The product of a twisted mind. Stupidly and cruelly violent, Should be banned for good."
2065,Squid Game,TBH THIS IS THE BEST KDRAMA IV WATCHED IN 2021. THE IDEA IS DIFFERENT FROM USUAL KDRAMAS. IT SHOWED US THAT THERE ARE MANY GREEDY PEOPLE THAT WOULD KILL AND BETRAY YOU FOR MONEY AND IT SHOWED HOW FRIENDS CAN SCARIFIES FOR EACH OTHER NO MATTER WHAT. I RLY LIKED IT AND I HOPE THERE IS SEASON 2 WHERE THE REVENGE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIED.
2066,Squid Game,"A really good show that is hard not to binge watch on the first day. Almoast every aspect is well design : Scenario, light, photography and sound. A thrilling and strange story that you can't stop holdin on. I recommanded it to my mother and i wasn't expecting her to love it but she did and she watched the all season in about 3 days. It really grabs on your curiosity and it is very emotionaly dense with lots of good caracters. I've never had such a cinematographic experience. A good mix of thrilling action and melancolic sadness. Caution to the fainted hearth it is quite violent."
2067,Squid Game,"I could see in this series alot of meanings of humanity...
And also it shows the everyday struggle for every human being who has nothing but debits
And how rich people treats them
This people can do anything just for having fun but in the end karma wins..this series shows how monster we are."
2068,Squid Game,Engaging. Thrilling. Absolutely fantastic. A must must watch.
2069,Squid Game,"First it looked very exciting and fresh content for netflix shows, the first game was amazing but then the following games were quite boring except game 4. The stories about characters were SO BORING, i could not watch most of the storylines about them. The lines were too long and boring and unrelated as well. Police thing was very exciting but then what? He killed by his brother who is the manager of the games(!) and nothing clarified?? Who is he? Why is he the manager of the games? As a watcher, it did not give me the answers so it was a wasted storyline too. And i do not even wanna talk about VIPs and their lines...they were horrible. And the ending, why did you go back? What about your beloved daughter?what about your promises?Besides all of these bad comments, it was a unique show and some scenes were very exciting than i could not even blink. So if you wanna have some disturbingly beautiful and at the same time some boringness you can watch it :)"
2070,Squid Game,"I saw many stories like this .. no new things
There is no special character."
2071,Squid Game,"The TV show has an excellent thrilling and engaging premise. Blood and violence are spilt all over the show. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. If you are into ""bloody games"" show, you will certainly like it."
2072,Squid Game,Just finished the show. All predictable situations. Poorly acted. Bad music. Sickening slow. Please no slo mo and long monologues saying nothing. I didn't like it a bit.
2073,Squid Game,"Could have been 7 ep show
Stupid ending
Too much gore."
2074,Squid Game,It is real lesson for ruch and porr people.movie is best every human being must watch this movie once in a life.
2075,Squid Game,".It took me a while to finish this series but overall I liked it. I think most people know the premise of the story, but i think the competition and games are not the most important part of the series, but the social critique of capitalism, greed, selfishness and people's lack of empathy and solidarity and also, it has good character development and we stick to some of them.In relation to the technical parts i think they will border the perfection and we see the passion and care with the serie.However, the series has negative points, such as ease of scripting and predictable parts, plot twist without sense and forced and halfway through the series it took time to unravel the story, but nothing that spoils the experience.I highly recommend this series for those who haven't seen it and that this series is a door for many people who are still kind of prejudiced with films, series, etc. From cultures other than English or American, which I understand and that I am sometimes, but it is necessary to deconstruct these ideas and see that there is more outside our comfort zone."
2076,Squid Game,"I cried A LOT, I had a mixed feeling, nothing was expected and almost everything I thought It was it wasn't. I NEVER give 9 stars but this is a masterpiece that teaches you a lot about the life."
2077,Squid Game,"You can say what you want, but this Netflix series is not original. It's copied from a Japanese show Alice in borderland and the American movie series The hunger games. Acting was great until, I saw the vip's, I cringed so hard."
2078,Squid Game,Very bad. This film for child 9 olds.dont watch this series .waste time.
2079,Squid Game,"Mind Blowing is a Korean drama series, the best drama series I have ever had. Enough to beat the money heists. (I already knew the police brother would be the head of the leader)"
2080,Squid Game,It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout.I love battle royal concept and this is one of the best in this concept.Acting was so good and cameos were amazing.I recommended for you to watch it.
2081,Squid Game,"I applaud you for the work that went into a lot of balls and for trying a drama that is rare in Korea as a Korean. But on the other hand, there were a lot of cliché scenes that I felt like I had seen somewhere, and there were a lot of parts that I didn't understand why the story continued and dragged like that. It was not a series of plausible and shocking reversals, but a series of plausible deaths and deterrence. The script is disappointing."
2082,Squid Game,"FOR those who are confused whether to watch the show or not:
1. First of all the the vip acting or their role in the show does not matter that much so do not stop yourself from watching due to them
2. The show is not disturbing(2-3 scenes you may find it disturbing)
3.the background music is good
overall the show is cool, it is sort of like escape room only there is no escaping so if you like such type then you should definitely give it a shot."
2083,Squid Game,Znnznznznznnsnsnsnsnsnnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnnsnznsnsnznsmz.
2084,Squid Game,"One of the greatest series this year, hoping for a season 2. Worth the watch >X<"
2085,Squid Game,One of the best webseries with catchy episodes... each episode will amaze you untill the last one.
2086,Squid Game,"Excellent Korean TV Series and what a great performance from the actors and actresses! The VIPs weren't that good, but it didn't effect how much I enjoyed the series.Very well made with lots of nail biting moments. I can't wait to see the next season!"
2087,Squid Game,"Even though the first 2 episodes weren't that amazing I loved it and would watch it again, but do not let your kids watch it. It is a lot of gore and very realistic so if you can't handle it I don't recommend it but if you can watch it."
2088,Squid Game,"I nearly switched it off during the first episode but I'm really glad I kept with it. Well worth it (except for the VIP's atrocious acting, as most others have said)."
2089,Squid Game,Behad bakwas..kaun de raha 8.5 isko?Such a dumb & predictable story & such a drag.Too much filmy nonsense & it drags n drags n drags. Such likeable actors but such a dumb story that you don't even want to knw how it ends & actually you won't miss much coz ending sucks too. Bhai kya bawaseer tha ye..isse achha toh tara Mehta dekh lo.
2090,Squid Game,"The VIP's were awful omg, and I actually sobbed when Ali and the other girl died in the 4th game. 067 is a goddess who we all should aspire to be like. Can we please force 456 to dye his hair back 😟"
2091,Squid Game,Squid games us tge alternate version of anime kaiji the ultimate survivor....is awkward how peps steal a work of anime artist and produce it as a mind blowing web series.... although squid game perform well and they complete one thing that's lacking in anime is gud face expression and they done a great job in direction and if u like squid watch kaiji too ... same experience...
2092,Squid Game,On episode two and the only reason I will watch more is in hopes that it will get better. I do see alot of potential and hope that the games are what brings it together.
2093,Squid Game,If you don't want peace in your life for some days..plz watch this in one go...its most horror breath taking movie without any ghost movie...dammm good...dammm..
2094,Squid Game,"Binge watching till the end of the nine episodes!Anxiety, horror, anger, fear, compassion...with all the mixed feelings. Korean series are always good at capturing the humanity in people and the depression of the society. Hopefully there's Season2 coming! TBC..."
2095,Squid Game,"Pros
Interesting plotFantasstic visualsGreat musicCinematographyCons
Predictable after two episodesMediocre acting (awful VIPs and lead)Villains were not developed enoughInconsistencies in the storyConclusion
It's an entertaining and visually appealing drama for sure, but goes downhill after a few episodes. Kinda reminds me of the original ""Purge"" movie."
2096,Squid Game,"Squid Game has one of the most incredible and unimaginable plots I have ever seen, it starts off with introducing the main character and his primary conflicts in life and how later on he is introduced to the game where he meets several other players to win the cash prize of a 46.5 billion. I wouldn't particularly call this show a masterpiece but it is quite near the mark, it truly depicts of how far humans go can to the deepest extent for their personal gain, the acting is outstanding and exceptional, it is so exquisite that you can feel the character's emotion running through your mind. Each episode just increases your curiosity more and more, that's what makes it extremely interesting, all together it was a meaningful series , the series started of exceptionally good however the ending is something which isn't satisfying at least in my opinion, you can watch and find out for yourself. Although I don't prefer watching Korean content , this is surely one of the reasons I would love to explore more Korean content."
2097,Squid Game,"A modern day battle Royale. A treat for the eyes.....,. ....... ......."
2098,Squid Game,"Very compelling episodes. The plots and ending definitely caught me off guard. The opening was slightly dragged but the foreshadowing was on point. Great acting, amazing sets. An enjoyable watch overall. 10/10."
2099,Squid Game,"This series tells about how powerful the money is which can kill people by making people play children game's.this series also teaches the importance of friends, family."
2100,Squid Game,"One of the best series on Netflix. The series is thrilling, emotional, exciting and addictive."
2101,Squid Game,"Surely a director show we can see it's presented exactly the way he wanted never tried impress anywhere just that raw like natural way I liked very much, it hits differently I you watch it next time after knowing the final episode, definitely in my top favs."
2102,Squid Game,It's a pretty good drama.it's not like most kdrama very different for a k drama the plot is great you should watch it it's pretty good.
2103,Squid Game,"I think the actors made this fantastic, some of the best character development I've ever seen. I was so invested I felt torn in some scenes! I agree with another comment about it making you uncomfortable but it was done really well! I really really hope there is a second series! Congratulations for all involved! I also applaud using a predominantly Korean cast as this gives people in the film industry there a time to shine!"
2104,Squid Game,"Seriously the amount of stupidity and violence is enormous
I dont understand why it's so popular
It has no social intellectual or moral value
One star."
2105,Squid Game,Loved the story overall but some important parts did not make any sense.
2106,Squid Game,One of the best serials i've ever seen!!😍Watch it with no doubt.
2107,Squid Game,"So I watched this TV series because it was all over the place and was being treated like some kind of masterpiece. The first two episodes were not great, but they were okay, then things started to become overly stupid and predictable. Don't even get me started with the terribly written script and acting. Although one of the themes of the show ""how far would you go for money?"" is interesting (but unoriginal), the show fails to explore this topic at any depth and the absurd twists and turns take out whatever realism was there to begin with. This has all been done better elsewhere."
2108,Squid Game,"This drama is probably one of the most compelling battle royale content out there. The last episode was a bit boring as it tried to set up a bridge towards season 2, but overall the dram has a really interesting storyline."
2109,Squid Game,Good aap but I cannot watch any movie so plz someone guide Me how I watch movies and tv dramas. If someone knows well the kindly guide me to watch movies 🙂
2110,Squid Game,"Beginning was amazing. However, the sanctimony and dreariness of the main character made it increasingly more difficult to watch. Kang Sae-byeok, for example, would've made a far superior main character. Then, VIPs we're utterly disappointing. What was even the point of Jun Ho, other than being a filler?! Also, this secret organization kidnaps and murders 456 Koreans annually in a very short and specific period of time, yet no one ever notices? Altogether, the concept has potential, but the obvious threads to Saw franchise and insufferable main character just didn't do it for me."
2111,Squid Game,"I see a lot of shows like this that start with a good idea but often fizzle out by resorting to common dystopian clichés like forgettable actors and leads, predictable plot lines and character choices, and the like.I was pleasantly surprised by Squid Game! It engages lots of different subplots in addition to the main game, and manages to make each one very invested and entertaining. If you're someone who wants some fresh takes on the thriller/dystopian scene, pick this show! It'll keep you gripping your seat, theorizing with your friends about who will live and who will die, in and out of the game itself. I had so much fun with this show and recommend it to any group of morbidly curious friends."
2112,Squid Game,Nothing new I am seeing in this story. And it's really boring as for me.
2113,Squid Game,"Since in late 2021 its been a popular conventional in everyone's mouth that a korean web series goes stupendous success in drama genre. I don't know or rather don't like series type movies so, i didn't saw that on purpose. Later i want to know what games present in this movies that pubg added their events. A curiosity grown in my mind after i watched the deady game red light green light, that gives me more interesting to watch this web series.In February after download 4 episode i start watching, firstly i got very amazed and scared after finish 1st episode. Then i saw how people become a slaves to money in 2nd epi. After i downloaded full season. In this way i really enjoyed this web series upto episode 5.But before i ended episode 6, it give me a heart touching moment that fells me very emotional. The character's sense of humanity, betrayal, sacrifices all are potrayed in one game. Seriously i was cried very much at that moment and became so emotional that i couldn't think about anything eles for few days.....literally. I only thought about the situation that was passed through the characters and the whole world seemed shut to me. I thought i can't watch this far more because my heart has broken into pieces :( . Then after a week i again start watching, thought in mind that whatever it would be i will finish it untill i come to the conclusion.In episode 8 there was another betrayal and saddest moment where a cute, innocent girl got killed by the main character's friend which was very unexpected. Personally I was not gave much attention for that character from the beginning but when she was in danger and finally got killed i became very sentimental for her. I felt so much sorrow and pain for the character and eventually this sorrow and pain grows love for the character. I love kang sae-byeok also the actress who potrayed the character Jung HoYeon <3 . I love the character kang sae-byeok at first but now i love hoooooyeony, who portrayed the character, more than anyone. The series ends in episode 9 reveals the winner of this game and what changes occur in the character's life.......and there should be a sequel that officially announced by squid game producers where we found the main purpose of making this game and reveals who's the mastermind of it.At last my conclusion is that.... It was one of the best web series in Netflix ever......you've ever seen before. I've never seen a web series before but after this I don't think there could be a better series like this ever made before in the world. This squid game was planned in 2008 by its director Hwang Dong-hyuk, and due his vigorous effort its series has been executed for long 13 years. Every characters has their tragedic flaws which will make their downfall in this play. All the character have their own reason for their death. If you carefully watch, you'll notice it.For all this reason i preferred and appreciate this Web Series and give it 10 out of 10 ratings.Thank You."
2114,Squid Game,"Really good show, until the VIPs show up in episode 7. Worst acting I've ever seen. It's like the director doesn't understand English himself and hired random American guys off the street. It doesn't ruin the show, but it's so bad. In general though this is definitely worth a watch."
2115,Squid Game,"I feel like this is one of those shows that went viral and it's not entirely clear why. The show is good, but nothing so exceptional that it deserves this kind of attention. In my opinion the actors, sound and cinematography are all great and I enjoyed their delivery.The writing on the other hand, is a pretty mixed bag. For example, the show's only subplot (that gets may 20-30% of screentime) has no impact on the main plot and then later resolves itself with a really underwhelming twist. Why did they even bother including it? In general, there are too many senseless twists towards the end that lessen the characters and series.Then there's the rather cliché ""rich people pitting poor people against each other"" setting. They make the rich villains so cartoonishly evil, that I can't take them seriously. Especially their ""69"" jokes sound like they were written by a 12-year old on 9GAG.My gripes with the writing aside, I think it was still an interesting watch. There are also some really obvious hints that the show is looking to make a sequel, so maybe the creators can write something more nuanced then."
2116,Squid Game,This movie is fantastic. A new topic that is best addressed.
2117,Squid Game,This Is another Netflix Master Piece Web Series egarly waiting for next season.
2118,Squid Game,One of the best series of 2021 i must say.Too Unpredictable....was fun to watch.
2119,Squid Game,"The series, Kalash Jamila, from Iraq, I wish, Part Two, Asun."
2120,Squid Game,"Korean cinema has been surprising a lot and squid game brought a very well constructed plot following a line of facts that interconnect very well with each other, I loved the way the suspense left nothing to be desired and has an amazing plot. Great!"
2121,Squid Game,"""Squid game"" is definitely one of the best series I've seen in my entire life. I fully enjoyed every minute I watched.What I loved about it:
1. The unpredictable script
2. The art direction
3. The acting (excluding the VIPs)
4. The incredibly well written characters
All of them had their own story and dilemmas.5. Episode 6
6. The plot twist in the final episode
7. The message of humanityWhat I didn't liked about it:
1. The plot holes
2. Seong Gi-hun's unbelievable luck in every gameQuick note: keep in mind that it can get kinda disturbing at times :/"
2122,Squid Game,I totally love it so i will give it 10/10. A s a matter of fact all actors were incredible in their acting but the vib were not.
2123,Squid Game,Here is why:1- bad casting.2- cringe acting.3- waste of time.4- plot is so freaking obvious.Overall it is overrated and boring to watch almost made me break my screen of how awful the main character is + the rest of the crew are as bad as him.
2124,Squid Game,"It has great suspenful moment and with decent to good character development. Due to this, a lot of the character death are painful to watch. It's definitely reccomended for those who love thriller. Plotwise, I would say it's decent enough to keep u watching and drive the story forward."
2125,Squid Game,"""Squid Game"" is a very interesting and enjoyable show that everyone can relate to. If I had to describe it in three words it would be money, life and death. All of these are universal which makes it very easy for anyone to understand what the story is about and why the characters act like they do.The main character Gi-Hun is a 48 year old miserable gambling addict who lives at home with his mother. While she works to provide for the family, an already in debt Gi-Hun gladly plans to gamble away the money he got to buy a present for his own daughter on her birthday. When things don't work out he is offered to earn some money by playing a kid's game and it quickly escalates to him joining a tournament of six games based in an unknown location with 455 other people. In there he meets up with the rest of the characters: Sang-Woo, Ali, Sae-byeok and Il-nam. One thing they all have in common is that they are in need of money. Sang-Woo needs money so he can pay a bet he made where he lost everything, Ali because he has a family back in Pakistan that needs providing and Sae-byeok because she wants to take custody of her brother. The only one who doesn't play the game for economical reasons is Il-nam. The old man has a tumor in his brain and feels like it's a waste of time just laying around and waiting to die.As the plot continues the characters get the hang of the games and understand that if you lose you'll be ""eliminated"" (in other words dead). After the first game panic breaks out and the survivors call for a vote so they can leave if they want. The result of the vote is a 50/50 with only Il-nam left. He finally decides to vote ""NO"" and they all leave with a promise that they can return if a majority wishes to. Back in their normal lives they realize that it's not much better outside and most of the contenders want to return. While this is happening, Jun-ho, a cop in search of his brother, discreetly sneaks on a boat on its way to the location of the games. At the island a lot of things happen but his storyline doesn't really lead anywhere and it's very separated from the main plot with it mainly focusing on giving the viewer a picture of the games backstage. I have read reports that state this was a forced last minute addition by Netflix which would explain this part.When the games get going you can see the real personalities of the characters flourish. Our protagonist pretty much stays the same throughout the entire show, same goes for Ali, Il-nam and Sae-byeok. Sang-Woo, on the other hand, will change a lot which is an interesting view on their situation. The others want to win together while Sang-Woo is determined to win no matter the cost, and this will be a crucial factor in a few of his drastic choices. Gi-Hun might want the best for everyone, but is the morally right decision always the right decision? Personally I understand both ways of thinking.I think the setting was unsettling because of the playful and bright colours. Hundreds of people play children's games in a very ""happy"" environment but then find out that if you lose, you die. It can be very disturbing for one to connect a childish atmosphere with blood and death, for the actual characters it must have been disturbing as well. The music can be found unsettling for the viewer in a very similar way to the environment because of the playfulness. Another thing I noticed is that they never give an overhead view of the city in the first episode which can give a feeling of claustrophobia and I think this is a metaphor for the situation our characters are in; to not have a choice but to continue the games. In the last episode we are shown a few views of skyscrapers and the city as a whole which might give you the feeling that it's over, but at what cost?Many will say that the twist at the end was a bad move, but after watching the show for a second time I discovered that we are handed out hints almost all the time. Il-nam talks a lot about his childhood and how the food they are served and the neighborhood in one of the games are identical to what he experienced as a youngster. Why he voted ""NO"" in the poll is because the plan always was for them to join voluntarily which says a lot about his ambitions. He also didn't lie about his reasoning for playing the games, the story stayed true to itself from start to end.There are parts of the show where stereotypes play a big part which is one of the negatives. Ali, the only non-Korean character, is the person to get fooled in the most important moment of his life. He is also always the one who needs explaining about the games. The likelihood that it just happens to be an odd one out who is treated this way is very low. Another part where the show generalizes people is when we are introduced to the rich american VIP-audience. This is very excessive and even if they are bad people, I doubt they would act like they do (not even mentioning their horrible acting). Maybe it wasn't on purpose but a show this big will send a message that maybe wasn't supposed to be sent.Since it has become known worldwide, maybe it will create a bridge between Korean movies and viewers from the rest of the world. Sharing cultures and different languages can be an interesting view for many. Personally I would like the story to end here so it stays a Korean classic and doesn't end up a victim of its own success. Another season would come with very high expectations and I don't think Netflix will stop the production of their most mainstream show ever until it's dead and buried.In conclusion, this show has its flaws but also its moments. Some of the acting is horrendous but the majority is very honest and you really get a connection to most of the characters. The stereotypes and the subplot are probably the worst parts about this show, but it doesn't overshadow all the good things. When you know what these characters are here for, the environment and music makes you feel for them even more. I also really like how the contenders begin to show their real selves when the survival instinct kicks in and how their mindsets change throughout the show. It also has a lot of cool shots and is overall just a great experience to live through. ""Squid Game"" is a great show that I would recommend to anyone."
2126,Squid Game,My first K Series ever and I was not disappointed. The story and acting were both amazing.
2127,Squid Game,"Too depressing, im gonna go cry now. I'm glad people like it tho."
2128,Squid Game,Good one. Enjoyed the episodes a lot. Worth watching. Koreans series or movies always amuse us.
2129,Squid Game,But the end looks so weird and bad and if there's a season 2 most characters gone and it was a bad idea to get out the chains girl I felt so bad for her 💔
2130,Squid Game,"This show is absolutely dreadful, it took me three attempts to get into and gave it on final shot as people were talking about on radio and tv etc. I haven't been this dissapointed since companies add 'Other' to the gender field on applications or sign ups...The show is dull and predictable. Im baffled with what people enjoy about it...even the concept isnt anything new there a at least a dozen game/death films on the market. Based on the reviews I genuinally believe the public are losing the plot and social media is Clearly numbing the brains of most people."
2131,Squid Game,"I didn't understand the fame of the series since it's a style that all movies are Ctrl C Ctrl V.Yes, I understand that this review is extremely short, but that's what I found of the series to be extremely shallow and lifeless, it doesn't seem like the characters are people, it feels like they're just characters."
2132,Squid Game,So unique story i love this movie so much i never seen series like this . This a awesome series ever seen omg.
2133,Squid Game,"I absolutely love this show, the story is great, character development, and basically everything keeps you interested in it. I'd say the first 2 episodes aren't as good as the following 7, but that's part of the good stuff. There are many plot twists that blew my mind, and I will defo watch it again <3Something that really made me ""cringe"" were the VIP's. Their scripts didn't feel natural enough and this is something that happens in almost every K-Drama or any Korean movie; they try and force Americans/foreigners in the movie and their scripting is just not good."
2134,Squid Game,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Acting was pretty good and the story and plot were crazy.
2135,Squid Game,"Not bad, but it's being a bit too over hyped. Seen better, seen worse."
2136,Squid Game,"Really interesting and different. Definitely binge worthy.Characters were well played and acted. Managed to keep tension throughout.I felt that the addition of the VIPs didn't lend anything to the story line, however I am hoping in series 2 that this will be explored more."
2137,Squid Game,"Waiting for season 2.....what am saying ..its a marvellous series,."
2138,Squid Game,"Boringgg. The story adapted by manga actually that comes from Japan, all of you just follow the hype...
Nxnxndnd
Djxjdjjdd
Jxnxnx."
2139,Squid Game,"Crazy world. Most dumb series, nothing to add. Just shows how underexposed human mankind developed. Would have prefered to rate with 0. Stupid, nonsense. Just shot of its best."
2140,Squid Game,"Bad acting and vip sucked, i wished this concept was made in usa."
2141,Squid Game,The series starts with a thrilling aspect and with great actors presenting an unforgettable perfomance. The ending could be a potential for season 2 but it couldve been better. Although the VIPs weren't the best actors but other than that the series was an amazing one. I am not a fan of korean cinema but this series and the movie parasite have surely changed my perspective.
2142,Squid Game,Got sucked in immediately by all of it. Was blown away by the performances too. Each actor does an incredible job. I too was derailed by the VIP characters' dialogue.
2143,Squid Game,"Had no idea what I was going in to, came out of some episodes with tears in my eyes."
2144,Squid Game,"Keeps you hooked right up till the end, brilliant, with amazing twists!"
2145,Squid Game,"Squid Game is one of the most interesting and gripping shows I've watched in a while. It grabbed my attention and kept it, and while that doesn't take a lot to do, this one made me come back again and again. It's creative, the atmosphere it creates is truly unique, and it shows a horrific perversion of the human mind, both in the VIPs and the Front Man himself.The VIPs were okay. I thought the character design and writing was spot on for what they wanted to portray, but the actors were definitely sub-par. Seems like everybody has said this already though, so I don't need to say much about it.Definitely a 9/10 for me. I'll come back and rewatch it when season 2 (hopefully) airs."
2146,Squid Game,"Great show, the VIP's are suck, speaks like they were reciting poem and over acting."
2147,Squid Game,Woow. Am shocked! Amazing sereies. Defined beauty.
2148,Squid Game,"Unbelievable story and character behaviours. Characters impossible to care about or have interest in. Awful over-acting. Genuinely embarrassing CGI at one point. Too much stuff that's obviously there just 'to be cool' to get clicks. (Put people in suits with masks and people will automatically rate it higher)Reminds me of one of those stupid movies like Cube (1997) you watch just because it's stupid, but this feels like it's trying to be serious and make some type of social commentaries like Parasite (2019) - but is just cringey in its effort.Hints of the Hunger Games, but you can get lost in that fantasy world, this you can't because it's set in the today world."
2149,Squid Game,"Has some good ideas and some of the episodes are good, but overall its not great, just goes to show how poor TV and Netflix has been over the last couple of years that this gets such rave reviews!"
2150,Squid Game,I was never thought I'm watching one of best web series after money heist I love it 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😋😋😍😍😍😍
2151,Squid Game,Seriously?8.3?The ending is absolutely illogical.
2152,Squid Game,Series is good we fans are waiting for the season 2 hope so it will be available in short time.
2153,Squid Game,"This show was hyped so much I decided to watch it.I liked the series, and the thought behind it. But the ending really blew it for me.There are so many unanswered questions. Why did he dye his hair red? Why did he not board te plane? Why did it take him a year to help the brother and mother from the other players? What was the reason for the policeman's brother to join as foreman?I had high expectations, but the last episode was a huge disappointment."
2154,Squid Game,The trailer is much much much more exciting than the actual series. The episodes are not as thrilling as promised and is filled with unnecessary conversations.. this is a waste of time. It does have good graphics though..
2155,Squid Game,"Was released today and I was hooked by the first 20 minutes. I finished it all the same day , if there was more seasons I would've been watching the next episodes as I'm typing this up right now. Very good series that will have you at the edge of your seat with many twists and turns. Once you think you know what's coming next , it hits you with a curveball. Highly recommended .You can watch this in one day easily as I did & it was just released a couple hours ago haha ."
2156,Squid Game,"A true survival series and extremely suspenseful. Enjoy it, well worth it!!!"
2157,Squid Game,Yes very unique content most powerful never miss. Most enjoyable.
2158,Squid Game,This show?! I have no words?! Really good 10/10!! I am amazed.
2159,Squid Game,"Wow! This should an award series of 2021 in Netflix. The story does contain both funny and horror at the same time. In fact, those actors were all perfect for those roles and it really draws your attention to chase the episode like crazy!Even in these covid times, this film creator and director does know how to pull audiences with a mix of keeping the tradition but develop modern series!Thank you so much for this wonderful series!"
2160,Squid Game,"The film making, characters, acting and premise was absolutely brilliant.I did find myself rolling my eyes more times than I'd hoped as characters made completely illogical decisions (I'm looking at you Ali) which conveniently fit the plot. I feel like it was cheap story telling that the writers thought the viewer wouldn't notice.The voice actors for the VIP's were horrific but hey it is a Korean series.Overall I'd give a 7.8."
2161,Squid Game,"This show is the best versions of a genre which has been done before. It's just unbelievably aesthetic, gripping and full of suspense. Some episodes are funny and some are very heavy. The season ending is perfect and fulfilling."
2162,Squid Game,"The show is great games in show is simple and easy for all people in the country religious to play but the show also has disadvantages that has a lot details that not make sense in show, also the plot twists are easy to predict. At this point Alice in Boderland is better."
2163,Squid Game,"There are three types of human relationships that squid game characters have.Type 1. The relationship between Deoksu (101) and his gang to obey by power.Type 2. Human relationships (218 and 1), such as Sang-woo (218), Il-nam (1), that give others to benefit from human relationships (218 and 1) succeeded in society, are intelligent, and elite)
Type 3. Ki Hoon (456), Abdul Ali (199), sae byuk (67) and Ji Young (240) have pure trust (less social experience or unemployed)The best way to relate was to play the 4th game.A. saebyuk-Jiyoung, Deoksu-His subordinates were a team of the same type.Saebyuk and Jiyoung lived a difficult life as North Korean defectors and killers in society, but Jiyoung sacrifices for the saebyuk that opened her hand for the first time (Confrontation between Type 3)Deoksu and his subordinates usually work together, but they have no choice but to turn right away in extreme situations where they live only when they kill each other (Confrontation between Type 1)
Deoksu's betrayal by his subordinates before entering the squid game immediately shows how easy human relationships are to be betrayed in extreme situations.B. Abdul Ali-Sangwoo, Ilnam-Kihoon were a team of different types of people.In the confrontation between Abdul Ali (199) and Sangwoo (218), Abdul Ali trusts Sangwoo until the end, but Sangwoo betrays and wins (Type 2 wins against Type 3).Sang-woo (218) gives Ali Abdul a bus fare, but I think he has changed in the same way as Type 2 as he has experienced a loss if he acts like 199 while adapting to society.-Ilnam (1) and Kihoon (456) are people who have lived opposite lives even in their numbers.Il-nam (No. 1) meets and plays with people like Ki-hoon (No. 456), who already makes a lot of money and feels demonstrated in life as he grows old, and gives no return, and feels joy in pure human relationships.Ki-hoon (456) gives a favor to Il-nam (1) and impresses the writing so that Il-nam loses on purpose (Type 3 wins Type 2)Ilnam (1) is a successful person in life, and he has lived in Type 2 way, and he seemed to think that it was right.Social life, socially high command and a lot of income people who think we should act in ways such as type 1 or type 2.I think I've experienced that type of people win while playing squid for a long time.The scene that shows this appears in the scene where vip bet 101 or 218 times as a favorite.Ki Hoon (456) was a person who overturned all of the above thoughts.-VIP didn't pick Kihoon (456) as the favorite.In the final, when Ki-hoon (456) tried to give up the money without stabbing him, Sang-woo was moved by Ki-hoon and committed suicide by admitting that his beliefs lost to Ki-hoon.Ilnam(1) has lost his mindset while playing the game.He lost to the type of person he thought was stupid who had stepped on to get a high position throughout his life.The last time Ilnam called Ki-hoon to play the game in the last episode seems to have tried to discuss Ki-hoon's reversal of his thoughts for the last time.Kihoon (456) met Ilnam at the end and played a game, and asked Ilnam, ""I won now, right?""
While playing the squid game, Ki-hoon showed ilnam that his thoughts were wrong as a result, but Ki-hoon doesn't seem to know that he did.It was a series that allowed people to reconsider human relationships by showing that people like Ki Hoon, who give trust and favor in no return, beat others."
2164,Squid Game,"Pretty Entertaining.!!It's the first time I've seen Lee Jung-Jae in a series. I know this will be good. I've watched movies where he starred in and most of them are so good. If you liked Battle Royale, Saw, or any other Survival Movies/Series and enjoy plots that involve thinking, psychology and strategy , Do Not Miss this out.The Western actors though are so bad at acting.Warning : A scene contains flashing lights that may cause discomfort or trigger seizure for people sensitive to light."
2165,Squid Game,"Was not expecting how deeply it makes you feel for all of the characters, there's a real connection you feel which makes you want them to win even more. Great plot with unexpected twists, would recommend this to everyone I know and anyone reading this."
2166,Squid Game,"I mean seriously this is it. This is why I hate listening to people before watching a movie. I had such high expectations for it, mostly when I heard it beats all Netflix series including Bridgerton, like someone actually had the nerve to say that. The first episode was the best; the only only one with the wow factor, then onwards the rest episodes were just filled with meaningless dialogues. Definitely not impressed."
2167,Squid Game,"Wow, this show had me hooked from the first episode. I've never been able to watch dubbed shows before but this was an exception! Watched every episode last night... amazing story and actors. If this was a movie it probably would have seemed ""cheesy"" to many Americans. I'm so glad they made it a tv show with plenty of time to build the characters and get the story right!"
2168,Squid Game,RECOMMENDED. Finished this in one night. I cant stop watching it. Worth every episodes.
2169,Squid Game,"Honestly the best tv show i've ever watched. Recommend it definitely 100%. Everyone should watch it, I finished the whole season in a day and a half."
2170,Squid Game,"Although I don't usually like violent weird fictional series I would like to comment on this one, which I found to be quite good if you watch it as a metaphor of the financial game, the squid game is in my view the financial game and I would like to give some hints of why I think this. There may be some spoilers ahead, so don't read further if you don't want to know them.In the series we are introduced to some characters that have already played the game, or similar games like gambling (most of the new players are highly indebted) or are just very poor people that will be invited to play the big game, which comes with the much needed reward, the big money.The gameThe game is the financial game and we see the players being part of it trying to get the big price but dying in the way because of that. Nobody has been forced to play the game but nobody knows what the game is about, and as soon as they are in the game they can't leave it if is not by a majority deciding so. And this is the big question asked for the game designers when participants are showed that the game will play with their jobs, their families subsistence and, in sum, with their lives.""Knowing this, do you accept the game or do you refuse it? ""Nicely, after the first deadly round the vote is tied, and the last voter, the player number one, which later on we will know is a game designer playing for fun, the only one on the game from the elite, the only one that deeply knows about the game and may by himself stop it, votes to stop the game giving to the poor folks the chance to live a decent live far from the deadly game. But the game never stops, so most of the players return to it when given a new chance to win or die.The island, the leader and the policemanThe game is corrupted, so it has to be played in an island, a tax haven, outside the law. This is a parallel plot ran by two brothers, one of them running the game, the leader, that would be the corrupt lawyer or the broker that we learn that already got his money share when he won a previous edition of the games, and a policeman, the law, that manages to get there looking for him as the leader is his brother, and that sadly is being killed by the corrupted brother being unable to expose the plot to the justice.The secondary playersBetween the players we find some of the social archetypes. There is the gangster, used to play by his own wild rules but without the skills and the knowledge to win in the big game, the immigrants, political and non political, playing with their disadvantages and being cheated and murdered, people with family traumas for whom the game means nothing now, the broker who already played the game in the real life before and failed, and who knows that the game has to been played dirty if you want to win, but even like this, you may always loose, ...The old man and the main characterFinally, between the players, there are two of them especially interesting, the first one and the last one. The first one is, as we find out at the end, a game designer that is so implied in it that cannot be like the other VIPs, gambling and watching from the outside, but has to play. His reward is not the money but the act of playing itself. The last one is all of us, is the TV watcher watching all of them, watching the game and being fascinated for it but at the same time refusing it, not willing to fall in its trap, not wanting to be mean, trying not to play dirty but at the same time doing nothing in front of the horror. This is why the old man takes an interest on him and there is a wonderful scene in the game of marbles where he sets up a situation inviting to the honest player to cheat, and he, the honest hero, cheats to save his life knowing that the old man will be unfairly killed for this. And then is when the old man gives him his last marble as reward, because the old man has now win his own game, he has finally won his own reward that isn't the money but knowing that everybody has a price and that everybody would have done what he possibly has done to become who he is. He can get rid of his guilt and he can leave the game as the real winner. However, when the hero wins the final game and may be proclaimed as winner, he refuses to win, he tries unsuccessfully to leave the game giving up the reward, and goes like this after that, being impossible for him to do anything with a money that becomes dirty as it has been earned cheating a poor old man who was killed because of it. He and the old man are on a similar situation now, both are rich thanks to the misery of others, and both feel guilty about it. So, in a desperately bid to get rid of his own culpability, of his own failure, the old man reveals him who he is, which is for some time effective, because our hero learns that nobody died because of him cheating and that he was the one cheated by the old man, so he may feel innocent again and enjoy the reward, until this falls again in front of the truth, revealed now by the recruiting scene of new potential gamers in the metro. Nobody who knows and has played the game may be innocent anymore."
2171,Squid Game,Hey guys I'm karan and I belong to India and im 19 years old this series is great I like it all actors very good paforamce.
2172,Squid Game,The show was epic!!!! But I want to know who sing that cover of fly me to the moon!!! I know that's not Renee olstead!!! Who is it!???
2173,Squid Game,I'm Korean and felt sorry for the poor translation. The frontman and other masked people all spoke Korean in a strange way. I think the director deliberately created a bizarreness through the horrible acting of people involved in the game including VIPs.
2174,Squid Game,"First of all , lets appreciate the aesthetics and the colors of the movie.Now lets make it clear that this concept is not new , its very similar to ""Kaiji"" an anime series I really loved , I started to get flashbacks from ""kaiji"" specially when I saw the VIPs and the bridge scene . I don't mind the similarity because I really liked how the move started The first EP was perfect but after that it became a rip off of a great anime series like ""kaiji"" , The plot holes started from the police man when he sneaked under the car like how is that possible? , and then he passed all the security . How the hell there's no cameras everywhere , why they didn't put cameras in the bathroom and a lot of other small rooms, and the most ridiculous thing they didn't put cameras on the boss's room . A lot of minutes were wasted with that 'wanna be detective' police officer , I really hated him since I saw him and I was waiting for his death ."
2175,Squid Game,"I really didn't expect that much when I started to watch this serie. I finaly binged it and loved it. Got sticked in front of the screen. I really liked the scenario and the acting. A very surprising serie that I suggest you to watch. Be aware however, this is brutal visualy and emotionaly."
2176,Squid Game,"It made me shed a few tears, not gonna lie. But it's a great show for being a Netflix Original."
2177,Squid Game,"This one kept me watching. Great characters. Interesting, if very dark story. I didn't find myself rooting for any single person. They were all flawed, damaged, even downright pathetic at times. Especially the ""protagonist"", which is a term I use very loosely here. He's not likeable. He leeches off of his mother, he takes money intended to buy a birthday present and dinner for his 10 year old daughter and gambles it away. Again, he wasn't likeable. But he was a well written character who at times I almost found myself sympathizing with, only for that sympathy to fade with another cowardly action.There is no objective good guy, with the closest one being the undercover cop, though even he acted questionably and reckless.Not every story needs a good guy though. I am fine with this. In fact, I applaud this series from breaking the ""hero of the story"" trope. Every single character seems to have a compelling reason for being where they are.In several ways, this series reminded me of Alice in Borderland, which I personally think was better written and one of my favourite series in this particular genre. Though this one was still a good series and well worth watching overall.Cue forward to the VIP scenes. As mentioned before, that could have been done much better. I don't know where they found these guys, but none of them were convincing. Their downright atrocious acting knocked down my rating by 2 stars.I can handle the occasional bad actor. I honestly don't mind when it's a single person in a role that isn't too important, but these VIPs filled the screen for far longer than their talent as actors should have permitted. Especially the old man with his 69 obsession. His lines were bad, his delivery, worse. Whoever he is, I hope that was the last time I saw him on a screen. He wouldn't have been out of place in Troll 2.I want to end this on a positive note. Honestly, the story was really good. The plot twist with player 1 is incredible and one I personally didn't expect, even if I had some suspicions. Towards the end, the main character has grown as a person and becomes someone I can almost respect. Which is quite an accomplishment on its own.But he should have gotten on the plane."
2178,Squid Game,"Squid game has set an extremely high bar for other shows of this genre. It is intense. It is raw. It is an emotional roller coaster. This is a masterpiece throughout. I actually felt that the poor VIP acting was a good metaphor of modern Hollywood when compared to the incredible performances by some of the main cast members here. I sincerely hope they continue the series in the same style and it does not get the SAW franchise treatment.But Episode 6 - Gganbu.... So powerful. Possibly the best single episode of a show I have ever seen.More, more, more please."
2179,Squid Game,"It was fun, but the show falls back on usual Korean story tropes (ie forced deaths to make ""cool"" sacrifices) , the acting by the VIPs was so laughibly bad and cringy that it almost tanked the whole show, and some stuff is stupid and makes no sense at all.Examples (spoilers!)1. The players keep acting like they can win the game together and get out of there together with the money, again and again. It's made 100% clear that they either can't stop playing until one person is left alive, or they can end things with a majority vote but then don't get the money. No one ever mentions this again or acklowedges that anyone they bond with will die if they want that money.2. They all left the game and then choose to come back, knowing the above... but a husband and wife joined again. They tried to make it a shocking and surprising thing that this poor couple are made to face each other to the death, but by choosing to come back they knew that one of them would have to die. Really dumb!3. The first time when they quit they say the accumulated money will go to the families of the deseased. When they return that money is still in the piggy bank and they continue from where they left off.4. The missing brothers stuff is in the goshiwon and it seems like rent was skipped for a month, so the cop brother says he will pay the rent and looks through his stuff, goes looking for him because of that card. Later we see in a file that he won the game years ago, and it seems he's been working as the front man for a good long time too. Um...didn't he just go missing recently?4. They gave my fav character a super cheap death. Cmon, random exploding glass took her out? She's there to play the games and no one notices she's been impaled or offers some medical attention so she can compete still...when they say it's all fair? How did they know there damn stupid exploding glass trick would not take everyone out and end the games by mistake? It was just a set up for that 3 in the sleeping area with knives scene, but was too forced.5. They took all interest and moral dilemma out if the ending by neatly killing off everyone, keeping the good guys hand s clean, and making the other guy a clear villain.6. The main character gets stabbed twice in the final fight but carries on fairly easily, but the other guy gets bit in the foot and that's it...becomes completely defenseless after that. The whole ending after that was very forced.7. The red hair thing was a little stupid. As was the case off money for the old lady and child - looks cool but how is she gonna use that or explain it when putting it in a bank? Her son is missing for fraud and the cops already visited her. In the same vein - him becomg a sudden multibillionaire didn't attract any attention from the tax office?8. When he got off the plane at the end: we went full circle and killed the character development because the last thing he does is impulsive, prob gonna get him killed (no way he can take on this shadow group with red hair and some cash - he's easily dead) and he lied and failed his daughter. Again.9. They didn't tie off a few things. The Morse code thing went nowhere if I'm not mistaken. The guy didn't do anything to get that mom back from N Korea.10. Also, cop guy infiltrates stupidly easily - and his iphone battery life is AMAZING. No way there's a charging cable laying around in a facility were no phones are allowed. Even Mr head honcho has to use a land line.11. Will normal people playing games really randomly all out try to kill each other at night? They say they provide less food to stoke tension, but there was enough for everyone if that group didn't cut in line for seconds. No way they'd know that would happen. And it certainly wouldn't guarantee a bloodbath. It's normal people in debt, not hardened criminals (apart from the one guy).And that's about what I remember. It was fun, but a little stupid too. It started very strong and could have been GREAT, but the writing needed tightening up and less reliance on formulaic tropes."
2180,Squid Game,"I'm Korean, and people around me kept telling me to watch this show so I decided to try it. Definitely exceeded my expectations. It brought much more emotional attachment that many Western shows, and I liked how the show wasn't very predictable. For example, I loved OBX but it felt a little repetitive to the point I started watching it more for the characters than the plot itself. However, this show really did well in terms of both the character development and plot.Also, I've seen reviews saying the Netflix subtitles were inaccurate. But idk, I thought it was well written (as a bilingual person) I loved the dubbings too bc the voices really matched.Lastly, to address the VIP scene, many people said they were poor actors and had cringe lines.I think the lines embodied the American culture pretty well for a Korean crew. At this point, yall should be thankful it wasn't worse. Also, since not a lot of foreigners live in Korea, it would have been difficult to pick up actual actors for the show."
2181,Squid Game,The best K Netflix Series I've seen recently.Hope they will release season 2 and 3 and moreeeee!!
2182,Squid Game,It was fun and interesting in the first. But got boring eventually and the last episode was way too long. I even fell asleep in the last episode. The ending was just nonsense.
2183,Squid Game,"I've never watched a series like this before. From the characters behavior's stand due the game time to pains in their civil life is effect your brain in the existential sense way. They show us mankind could do everything for some stupid piece of paper with a small games that we played in our childhood. On the other hand as the games progress, you witness other games played behind the scenes and the taste of the series starts to get better. Omg! I don't want to give you spoiler! Just watch it. I hope the second season will airs."
2184,Squid Game,"Poetic yet Gruesome, the story shows the harsh reality of the world through a fictional series, modern slavery. They director succesfully make the audience to have roller coaster of emotions: suspense,relief,grief. They also give attention to small details that made the story truly brings out. The actors also played their role really well, enough that bond were built between the audience and the actors."
2185,Squid Game,"The overall series is very accurate and interesting will make your interest on high octane edge. The actors have done a brilliant job, Character developments are also so impressive and fantastic. The makers should need to season 2 as soon as possible because It's been a long time since I've seen something new. Therefore, it should be taken forward."
2186,Squid Game,One of the greatest shows I have seen in years. The VIP actors ruïned some parts unfortunately.
2187,Squid Game,"The switch from game to Vip lost my suspense a bit, as well as the Vip's couldn't act.But other than that an amazing nail biting show with amazing sets and actors."
2188,Squid Game,"The acting, and graphic was good, the cast's acting me have no complain at all, its awesome, me love it.But, how about the story? Well, I would say the whole story was good, but there is some part that confusing, there is a lot of detail that need to be explained, I hope they explain the details in next season."
2189,Squid Game,It's super dark and intriguing and shows the lengths different humans will go out of greed. Messed with me a lot though sheesh.
2190,Squid Game,"Honestly, this show puts a new meaning to Korean series. My boyfriend always thoughts my obsessions was in vain but come on! Even he admits this show is fire."
2191,Squid Game,"Squid game offers everything you can ask for in a guilty pleasure gore filled thriller. They also take their time to really flush out the characters even with such a diverse cast, highlighting all aspects of humanity that would expect to see in a game of life and death.With a 9 episode run for this 1st season it's a great weekend binge show."
2192,Squid Game,"I don't know what to feel about this movie series. The main protagonist questioning the morality of others, where he obviously lacked it when he cheated against the old man (pre-character reveal). And still he continues to question the morality of the game even when it just started, it is already clear that you have to surrender your morality in order to survive.I also have to fast-forward some drama moments because they are very cliché to be honest."
2193,Squid Game,"What an amazing series taking you on a roller coaster of emotions, we couldn't stop watching it. I agree with the other viewers that the VIP acting was rubbish but equally I think they are meant to represent caricatures of the most vile people who enjoy killing for sport. Wow the acting though from the Korean cast is first rate and the story line has a deeper message for all of us. Episode 6 had me wrecked!"
2194,Squid Game,"It's disturbing but all the more entertaining for it. I rarely watch series with a plot, let alone that fast (took me less than 4 days, which is super unusual for me). Read some reviews saying there was no character development but I will have to disagree. All major character change from ep 1 to their last respective scene. Some scenes were very emotional as well, ep 6 had me sobbing. The acting by the VIP's was a bit off-putting but ultimately didn't bother me as much. I loved the games too, being of Korean descent. Only the 5th game was somewhat out of order and dragged a bit. The additional storylines around the games made it even more real, somehow. There are some open ends which have me looking forward to the 2nd season."
2195,Squid Game,"I rarely write reviews but this show is bingeworthy, it gots me laughing, crying at the same times and the color of the movie, those actors' acting skills were heart-touching, spectacular I must say. I guess I was a bit confused due to the last episode but to dig deep down inside the main character, he has a really warm heart from the moment that he fed a cat to the moment that he stop the game for his friend, so I guess it has never been easy for him to use that money immidiately. And after seeing the death of 455 players, it is understandable why he didn't choose to break his daughter's new family in LA (which can be considered as paradise) but come back to Hell Joseon as a new human-being (when ppl change their hair color, it means that they want to be a new them) to maybe get revenge for his friend or change the whole system of the game ^^? Can't wait to know what will happen next so please release season 2 the sooner the better!!!!"
2196,Squid Game,"There's something about Korean shows on Netflix always hitting the gold spot. Furthermore, so excited for another season."
2197,Squid Game,"Complete garbage soap, shallow and vapid characters, interactions, dialogue, garbage cinematography and picture quality, godawful choreography and camerawork. Scenes and setting both looking like haphazard trash, while also being excessively extended and serving no purpose at all. The show simply capitalizes on vulgarity and shock factor to attract lowbrow audiences."
2198,Squid Game,"Spoilers (sort of?)The reason I gave this a star down is purely the fact that all the good hearted people dying got me so depressed. However, I should have expected that. But aside from that everything was amazing! The story line stays entertaining throughout the whole season and only gets better. I'd watched this a thousand times over."
2199,Squid Game,Very interesting movie and the game seems easy yet super tricky. My favourite part is the honeycomb game.
2200,Squid Game,"On first episode meeting the girl who stole his money was a mistake from the director because it showed how easy I could predict what happens next . Last episode has many faults
I enjoyed the series but I hoped the scenario would be smarter than what I saw 😔"
2201,Squid Game,An amazing movie I love him. I recommend it to peek it's great so I recommend take a look.
2202,Squid Game,"Seriously, you guys really didn't know who was behind it? Didn't you really figure out very early on who the Leader was? Every plot of this show was outrageously announced by the director/acting. I give it a 5 because the idea is excellent! Out of the box. But the execution was terrible. It is a very serious mistake to let the viewer know the most important plot of the show in the FIRST EPISODE!!!!!I understand the folks with grades 9, 10. I believe there is a little more repertoire missing."
2203,Squid Game,"Just a silly scenario, with a big investment, and a cheesy end. Please stop comparing it to Casa de Papel."
2204,Squid Game,"I hate movies/shows with subtitles but, I absolutely loved this show!!"
2205,Squid Game,"At some scenes, the actors are overacting. The cinematography is not too good. There is a nonsense part, where they play that rope game, why the old man's hands gotta be locked if he was the maker of this game? And yeah, they not supposed to be blame each other players in that arena! The ending is just ruined all the previous episode. Peoples need to see hunger games before they say that this is the best korean series -_-"
2206,Squid Game,"This movie is sooooo overrated, it's a blatant plagiarism from Japanese movies like ""As the Gods will"", ""Liar Game"", ""Friend Game"", and the final twist is a piece of a popular series name Saw.The director of the film even stated that As The Gods Will was created in the 2010s, after his initial idea for Squid Game, but if he had to say it, he would say he did it first.Seriously? He make a movie that has a lot of stuff copied from movies that came out years ago and say he made it first by his idea?!? You think audiences are stupid?You create something after someone else, you have to make it different otherwise you are just a copycat of other people's work and effort. You can't just copied and say ""I made it first because I had the idea in mind first."" It's ridiculous!Stealing other people's work and make it your own it's dirty and unacceptable in the modern world, a really talented, self-respecting director would definitely never do that."
2207,Squid Game,I thought it was just something to put on but I ended up watching it twice 😍
2208,Squid Game,HOW DO I START THE EPISODEEE???????!!!!!Just enibodey help me whit this plissss.
2209,Squid Game,"1. The red jumpsuit of the numbers - symbolizes they are like a colony of red ants. They work together but when one person is gone, it won't be a big deal and they can easily be replaced by another ant or in their case, another number. I think them being a red ant instead of being a black ant (apart from looking friendly or light) also insinuates that they're the more aggressive ones (they're the ones that kill off people) since red ant's bite is harsher than a black ant's.2. The masks - symbolize that the numbers work for the players but the irony is also that they don't WORK for the players. They are not controlled by the players because the players are not the ones actually in charge of the games.3. The ladders in the lobby - symbolize social hierarchy that we need to climb as we progress to the society. As the players move to the games, they climb up the ladder, meaning they're reaching a higher hierarchy because they are gaining more money through playing.4. The ribboned / present-like casket - the art director said that this symbolizes that the creator views themselves as a god that has given the players the chance to change their life. Their money was a present from them and their death is also a present from them.This show just have the perfect tone, pace, setting, and depth."
2210,Squid Game,The movie tries to show the humanity but doesn't really make sense.
2211,Squid Game,"The story is set in secret Island. It is about of a group of people who risk their lives in a mysterious game of survival with a reward of 45,6 billions won (32 million euro).My opinion about this series, I think it's one of the best serie that I have seen. It holds in suspence and we can't wait to know the end. I recommend it to you 100 %, looking forward to the second season."
2212,Squid Game,"I've watches it all in one night and it was good, but it was killing me emotionally trough all episodes so the last two I essentially just skipped trough. I'm not sure if it was worth it, it's a good psychological thriller though."
2213,Squid Game,This show is very deep and meaningful. There's life lessons you can learn from watching this. It's suspenseful and gruesome. I finished 9 episodes in 2 days and almost dislocated my jaw. Loved it and hoping for Season 2!
2214,Squid Game,The korean drama always impresse us.you just have to watch it.
2215,Squid Game,"Definitely in my Top 3 of K-Dramas. Just watch in Korean with subtitles because dubbed versions are never authentic and just so cringey (in general, please watch your shows in the original language).And yes, the VIPs were horrible but luckily they only played a small role. However, the main actors were incredible and definitely deserve an award!"
2216,Squid Game,"I feel I'm quite hard to please when it comes to to shows and movies, but this was really really great to watch. Never wanted it to end
The subtitles/dub don't match up so it's kind of take your pick what you want to translate it all as but it doesn't take anything away from the actual show."
2217,Squid Game,"Ali deserved better and that's all that needs to be said :,("
2218,Squid Game,Squid Game reflects Korean society very deeply. All characters could be found in real Korean society. Worth watching! Only minus was very bad VIPs acting.
2219,Squid Game,It was sad that your uncle died in the series. I expected your uncle not to die and win.
2220,Squid Game,"I found the beginning of the first episode to be extremely slow paced and I instantly disliked the main character I was seconds from turning it off and giving up on this show but then finally...... bam! It gets interesting and extremely bloody and thrilling and I couldn't stop watching and found myself often wondering what I would do if in their situation. The main character became less annoying and I eventually grew to enjoy him as a character and really rooting for him. I actually guessed the twist very earliest but enjoyed it none the less. Do not watch it you can't stand senseless violence, blood or are squeamish."
2221,Squid Game,"Boring and sucks.You will waste your time, it should be 1 star rating."
2222,Squid Game,"Dramatic uniform, dramatic instagrammable masks. The plot is so forced. Nothing is thrilling. Too overrated i think."
2223,Squid Game,Must Watch if you're interested in horror/dark scenes.
2224,Squid Game,Biasa aja overhype series.basic gore series. Not worth to watch. They should make it movie not series.
2225,Squid Game,"Firstly this is a great series - probably the best Korean series I have watched (and I love Korean series').HOWEVER, I had this strange feeling in the back of my mind the whole time watching Squid Game, that I had seen this somewhere before, many years earlier in a Euro movie starring Max Von Sydow.Anyone else seen INTACTO?"
2226,Squid Game,Brings nothing new to an already over saturated genre.
2227,Squid Game,The worst series ive ever watched i swear it is so bad and awful !!!Like how can you enjoy watching such thing seriously? I wasted my time watching it 🤢
2228,Squid Game,"The psychological dimension of the script is well written. Once you know the new game u can figure out what will happen next. The story is somehow acceptable Acting is good, not great. The best part for me is in Episode 5 when the game manager is speaking about the equality."
2229,Squid Game,"I have enjoyed alot of films and I find predictablity destroys a film. Now days hollywood goes so far to try and throw people that it has become predictable and frankly unbelieveable. But with this series I found myself on the edge of my seat questioning everything and genuinely and believeably caught of guard. Its not just brilliantly written and visually impressive but the ethical turmoil will make you reflect on the very foundation of human morals in a way I have never seen before. Very very good visuals, brilliantly told story and refreshing."
2230,Squid Game,"It was very predictable. I predicted death of the last girl, survival of old man and many more.."
2231,Squid Game,"This deeply dark and disturbing show dragged on for nine hours, nine damn hours - for what? To show us billionaires shouldn't exist, poverty causes desperation, and capitalism sucks? Really? We needed a poorly conceived none hour saga to show us that? No.The writer was not only a nihilist, but also constantly spelled out everything the audience is shown - leaving nothing clever, nothing subtle, and nothing original.I'm very concerned about how well rated this show is. Truly. Y'all concern me."
2232,Squid Game,"The show has a plot that focuses on multiple people who are in a financial crisis, that engage in a death game with the last person standing winning a lot of cash. The way the games are done builds up anticipation of what is to come next , leaving audiences on the edge of fear and anxiety until eventually it unfolds into shock , as they see that in these games no life is spared. As for the actors , every actor does a great job of playing each character that has their own unique character traits . Overall , in my honest opinion everything was executed wonderfully from the music , the cinematography , plot , characters , and much more. Truly , if you haven't watch the show yet I promise that if you do watch it , you will be stunned by it and will be left wanting to see more."
2233,Squid Game,"Definitely best watched in Korean with English subtitles.Incredible acting, great story line, have already watched twice and will probably watch again. Plenty of little moments that add to the story."
2234,Squid Game,Warning graphic violence Warning....when watching your favorite will addiction on tv show whole 9 episodes is great on Netflix.
2235,Squid Game,"Just an artistic rollercoaster.The idea is so simple, but the execution is masterful.It got so much depth to it, unbelievable."
2236,Squid Game,"They just suck. Everything about them is just bad, they were build up to be so cool but so disappointed."
2237,Squid Game,"SO HALAL MODE. Here a so perfect film but one problem, bad words 9/10."
2238,Squid Game,"Squid Game is one of the most popular TV series of 2021 so I decided I would try it out. The show completely captured me when it came to the drama between the characters and the intensity of the games. I recommend this show if you're interested in a fast-paced, drama series that will leave you on the edge of your seat and will make you think at the same time. This show is relentless and graphic so it's not for the faint of heart. For nine episodes, Hwang Dong-hyuk captured many facets of humanity and the world as we know it.Characters:I enjoyed many of the characters and the acting was phenomenal. At first I criticized Gi-Hun for being a gambler but as the series went on it showed his tragic downfall and the lack of job security in South Korea. I don't know much about South Korea but I imagined it to be somewhat more prosperous than America. No, everywhere is cruel, I learned, as the world showed Ali's kindness taken advantage of and the ending bet with the man in the snow. I loved Sae-Byeok and I cried when her friend gave up her life for her. I even felt some remorse for Player 218, or Sangwoo, when he was lying in the rain, completely jaded, the rain crashing down on him on the realization on what he did. Each character has their moment and I felt for each one of them.**
Themes:
The themes are what make this show beautiful. Gi-Hun and Sang-woo being foils of each others was well-executed. I kept asking myself the question, is Sang-woo wrong? He had to kill those people to survive. He had to push the man in glass hopskotch or the others wouldn't have made it. He did what he had to do to survive, and yet we critcize him because we think it's what we wouldn't have done. But we would we to survive? And then the war of poverty and tragedy with all the characters was honest but heart-breaking to see. Ali still had to break his morals and hurt a man to receive his salary for his family. 067 or Sae-Byeok pickpocketed because she had nothing else to resort to - after all, she was an illegal alien from North Korea. We don't know why Sang-woo fought (he had only his mother left) but he wanted to restore himself instead of admit he was not the pride of his hometown.**
Criticisms
Many plot threads go nowhere. Doctor sub-plot was pointless, although I was still chilled by the Front-man's lack of respect for the Player's body. Also, the Morse Code wasn't mentioned again unless it was relevant to the Doctor subplot.Jun-ho effortlessly managing to get into Squid Island. Would have been interesting if they had intentionally let him raid it and kill him afterward (after all, who can be blamed if everyone remains anon. This man broke the rules so many times but the most he got was a slap on the wrist? What is the point of the rules for the employees then if the only enforced rules are the masks?The plot twist with Jun-ho finding out the Front Man was his brother. An extreme plot hole considering the beginning (mentioned by mrloletter) when Jun-ho was paying his brother's rent for only a month. His brother wasn't missing that long. But then later we find out that he won in 2015(?), so 5 years before the show began. So I guess the brother is a bit older than him but holy crap the Front Man looks considerably older. I didn't really understand the plot twist. Maybe the Front-Man will feel bad that he killed his brother? It showed that he did feel some remorse and that he was willing to save his brother. Since we don't understand the Front Man's motivations this scene was very odd.The VIPs. The acting was horrible and ruined my immersion in the show.The Ending
Personally I really loved the ending. Many don't like how Gi-Hun turns into a strawberry but I liked the symbolism, albeit it was way too obvious. He had lost his mother, explaning why he didn't go straight to his daughter. Even though he had won he still felt like he had failed. That he was too late. The worst feeling in the world. He felt like he was a horrible person and didn't know what to say to his daughter (remember that he still hit her stepfather and never explained it to her). Even with him calling the number and saying that ""I'm a threat"" was a bit interesting since it leads on to a Season 2, and also shows he still has some fight left in him.Player One being the founder was an odd twist but I still liked it since it exposed who he was as a person and his attitudes toward the poor (being deserving). Playet One was honest at the games telling Gi-Hun, his gganbu, his reasons, his motivations, and even his greatest weaknesses. He still loved Gi-Hun in some way that I still liked his character (even though he's a horrible person).Overall I'm excited for Season 2 and what to come. Squid Game is absolutely amazing!"
2239,Squid Game,It's a good serie to watch and it has a good story if you just dont think about what's gonna happen.
2240,Squid Game,"Its a best 21st Century watch, it has technology, drama, thrill, action, dramedy, gore and what not . . . Impressive work by the Koreans."
2241,Squid Game,"Personally I found squid game a bit boring and sort of emotionless. I watched Alice in borderland soon after it came out, last year and I loved that and thought I'd probably like squid game. But I must say I much preferred Alice in borderland, the characters were far more gripping and showed much more emotion. Out of the dramas I've watched recently (I'll include Alice in borderland); Vincenzo, Sweet Home, Alice in borderland and Squid game. Squid game is definitely my least favourite.It had a lot of plot holes and it didn't really seem to go anywhere. Squid game has definitely got too much hype.If you want a really good drama to watch, go watch Vincenzo. It's absolutely amazing and has a really interesting premise which it pulls off perfectly. ""Chef's kiss""."
2242,Squid Game,"How could this becomes a hit, do people like this much of violence, this series is so cruel."
2243,Squid Game,"Wow! Loved every minute of this show. Original, gripping, and heart wrenching.Am I the only one who thought the VIP's were actually a piss take on what Koreans think of rich, arrogant and obnoxious Americans? Well, I thought it was great.This show will stay with me and it's meanings behind it (whatever you individually take out of it). It is definitely up there as one of my all-time favourites.So good."
2244,Squid Game,Good. It is a good series.esta muy bien.and It was so satisfying.
2245,Squid Game,"The setting was standard for a death game show, but the main characters' writing was splendid, and there is character growth which is rare."
2246,Squid Game,The overall show was pretty cool but the ending is such a let down. The main character seems to hate himself so much that he cares nothing for his family or his life. Such a disappointment we could have ended it with him having a wonderful life with his daughter and starting season 2 brand new..... what were the writers thinking.
2247,Squid Game,"It's good to grasp the tears and refreshing points. The pinball level did poke the tears, and then it did arouse some thoughts. Is it necessary to pay a down payment for ten years, and then carry a mortgage for thirty years until retirement."
2248,Squid Game,"I don't think it's worth the hype, the games were overall boring and dragged out far too long.I didn't find any of the characters particularly likeable, some were just outright annoying from the off.It's probably worth a watch if you've nothing else, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression like any other series of similar storyline."
2249,Squid Game,"This show draws you in and it keeps you hooked. The acting and character development is so good that you truly feel for the characters, which makes their demise that much more heart wrenching."
2250,Squid Game,The season was amazing from start to finish. I couldn't stop watching it I watched it one go. The English dubbing though it terrible doesn't fit the actors as it's all American accents so I recommend Korean with English subtitles. Hopefully they'll do a second season.
2251,Squid Game,Hoyeon's acting was amazing.VIP acting was atrocious.
2252,Squid Game,"As a director I enjoyed so much (frame by frame)
everything was complete and enough!I gave you 10 golden star for this production and waiting for the next season.Great job everyone!"
2253,Squid Game,"Meh, Despite great performances from the Korean cast, this series failed to impress... Oh, don't get me wrong, I watched every episode back to back as if binge eating a tube of Pringles but where am I after spending 9 hours of my life on this? Like a bad lay, I'm feeling a little cheated tbh - after an interesting hook, it failed to develop its theme to maturity. By the end you'll have yourself for watching for the only reason of ""who'll die next?"" I'd personally like my 9 hours back."
2254,Squid Game,Best ever and very good that the best series eve.nzjzjzjsmskzjxndnxdjjsjsjsnsbdbdhdhdhebdbdbdbdbdbd.
2255,Squid Game,Addictive season~ I doubted first but could not stop watching!
2256,Squid Game,Series full of suspense and thrill.....but subtitles were not up to the mark.
2257,Squid Game,"I saw it with English dubbing, but I don't think I connected with it at all. The build-up to the tale is fantastic, and it's always fun to watch a suspense game series. I liked it, but I wasn't as impressed with the finish as I was with the beginning."
2258,Squid Game,"For those who remember the episode of Breaking Bad with the fly. The last episodes were just like that, long dialogue without true story development and not much happening. In my opinion that killed it for me, I was really disappointed. Other then that, I recommend."
2259,Squid Game,I saw it. It wasn't all that great. I would watch it again if I was bored. There is too much hype about it. I just don't understand why people think this is such a program.
2260,Squid Game,This show is good but overhyped. What are white people so excited about this show? Asians dying? That's sick in the head if you ask me.
2261,Squid Game,I really don't know what the fuss is about? Squid games plays everything every normal person wants to see. It's amazing and well done to the producers. Squid games is living proof once you have failed never give up hope!It also shows how desperate people are to get out of debt something that society should review.
2262,Squid Game,"I did enjoy first three episodes for setting up the tone, but past those show drags on, I don't think story was fleshed out beyond there's this room and people play games in it and if they lose they die. Ending is also.lackluster, you expect it to reveal the motives for this game but the answer you get is unsatisfying to say the least.Also, from the ending episode seems like they're setting up for another season, but frankly, I don't think there's much left to tell in regards to the story, and I fear like with most decent series it will devolve into The Walking Dead.variant of the Squid Game, where they renew for the new seasons and only then start working on the story and I doubt that's enough time to write a captivating story, nonetheless, I wish them good luck. For first three episodes alone, I'd say it's worth a watch."
2263,Squid Game,"Wow, I finished the serie in a week. I loved it so much! The storyline is great, the cast is awesome everything is just great!On Netflix you can choose in which language you wanna hear it, please choose Korean cause it sounds better and it´s the original language of course. (Just a tip) :)Have fun watching it!"
2264,Squid Game,"Bad acting, bad dialog, bad plot. The only person in the whole production who knew what they were doing was the cinematographer!The acting was over the top, from all the actors, not just the English-speaking ones. Dialog was bad and mostly exposition. Tv is a visual medium, show don't tell! And last but not least the plot wich came with no surprises, even tho it tried really hard. The whole story, not just the ending, was way too easy to predict. After episode 2, all the excitement was gone, and the rest was just a snooze fest."
2265,Squid Game,"When you are watching this show, you will go through 3 stages of enjoyment.Episode 1: This is pretty good I'm excited to se what happens.Episode 6: Okay, yes. This is a good show! I, I am totally on board.Last Two Episodes: Okay you've, you've completely lost me.That's basically it. The conclusions to the plot lines in the last two episodes ruin and spoil the earlier 7 episodes, but not enough to completely destroy the show. The final episode especially. But check it out!"
2266,Squid Game,"For those of more mature years, familiar with Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), this will resonate...re: Long Walk, Running Man.Only watched episode 1 in Korean with English subtitles, but I did enjoy it. I hope that this continues."
2267,Squid Game,"This is a complete insult to the saw series. Old man with brain tumour plays sick games on vulnerable people? Remember? Acting, shocking. Everything has to be a binge series these days, but Christ, if you made it through the second episode of this wanting more, without the apprehended hype then you need a medal for perseverance. I'm done."
2268,Squid Game,"Honestly, one of the best series to watch. The most unexpected twist is the old man. I just loved this series. I would say one of the best series released this year. Worth to watch."
2269,Squid Game,A Geat series after many years!! Must Watch. Would like to see season 2.. Cant wait.
2270,Squid Game,In episode i actually cried . That the power of this series. We feel same emotions what the series want us to feel.
2271,Squid Game,I wasn't love the Korean drama but this is amazing!How did they wrote it how did they made it wow!
2272,Squid Game,"Its a nice game thought i didnt finish to watch it i think its a nice movie
you."
2273,Squid Game,"I had to create an account to announce my disdain for this, I have no idea what people think is good TV anymore, I imagine that the sort that love this probably camp out to watch each fast and furious film, you know the type, its bland its predictable and nothing new, blown out of proportion by the Facebook and tiktok crowd. Drivel, I'd sooner watch paint dry than watch this again, or have my eyeballs resurfaced. I can't express how dull this is enough, do yourself a favour and avoid it, unless you love the fast and furious then you'll be all over this."
2274,Squid Game,"Squid game it's a good show, but the marketing and hype around is overrating this serie, making some people how's gonna watch create too much expectation."
2275,Squid Game,"I am 35+ and during the last decade I see people getting obsessed about pain, kills. Really how u can find that scenario interesting? It is all about pain, physicians mentally. If people enjoy this kind of series then something is not going well in our society ..."
2276,Squid Game,"What a huge disappointment. I wanted to keep on going but had to stop watching after 6 episodes, so if there actually was a point to this series, I did not stay long enough to learn it.This show tries to be very graphic and to shock you with how little can human life be valued while at the same time desperately (10x per episode) attempts to attack your deeper emotions. Almost all of the characters are either extremely annoying or disgusting.No thanks."
2277,Squid Game,"This show was one I found on accident before all the hype. The aesthetics were so beautiful and I fell in love with all the characters. I just don't know if the ending was necessary. He could've gotten on the plane to be with his daughter!!! I really think they just set it up for a season two, which is fine but I know we won't have those loveable characters we had this time around.😭"
2278,Squid Game,Squid game is definitely a great show to binge watch. Plot is good and great characters and good ending. The best thing about Squid games is it's unpredictability. Anything can happen anytime which hooks the viewers.
2279,Squid Game,"Normally, I'm not a big fan of Korean series and music. But here I have to say well done to the director and the actors of this series. I'm not a big fan of series in general, because I never get hooked and get bored very easily. So I am someone who watches a lot of film and hardly ever a series. This time around is the first time I've ""LOVED"" a series and hooked it from start to finish. The story is original and it feels like a kind of hunger game, with characters who are in dire straits and who fight until the end to win a huge amount of money. The fact that the series is really different from all the other series is that it has its own universe, its own setting. Watching this series is like a drug. We are addicted and we want more, we want to know more things. We easily get attached to the characters because we pity them enough. And I think it's a good lesson in morale, this series certainly represents, a little exaggerated, today's society. I can only advise you. If I had to give this series a rating, it would be 19/20 because season 2. We can't wait !!"
2280,Squid Game,"Visible Korean series with almost good characterization and interesting and non-repetitive story
This series, which today has become famous and viral only with Netflix commercials, cyberspace, money, has made every person one of the most watched series just because of the words of the community and people and because of the culture shock It has become one of the most watched series But have you ever wondered how popular this series would have been if it weren't for the commercials? Just like the series because of under rated BB Being canceled after the first season or two, which in my opinion are under rated series like banshee or... are really 10 times better than this over rated series
Thank you for taking the time to read this text."
2281,Squid Game,"On the base, Squid Game appears to be a standard Korean horror/thriller we have been slowly getting more accustomed to in the west over the past few years, however beneath the surface is a very deep, complex and scarily real message that is incredibly relevent in these troubling times.Without spoiling anything, this series is certainly worth sticking with through the slower parts, as the ending and message is extremely powerful. Worryingly, I feel the complexity of the message may mean it is lost on the average viewer, but left me deep in though and reflection upon its completion.I'm sure in the years to come this series will be looked back on as the benchmark for complex and contrasted story telling, and even though it is extremely popular now, in years to come it's message may be more appreciated."
2282,Squid Game,"Plz make chapter 2.I like it.can top 1 in worldBest
Best."
2283,Squid Game,"Red light, green light is horrible and Little bit commedy scene show in instagram. Show I decide to watch this series. Sugar honeycomb is I like between all games. Upto 5 th episode everything is going well and enjoying but at 6th episode my heart goes down at that time. All liked players get eliminated. After watched 6th episode all further episode got silence. Twist of player 001 is unexpectable. I like background sounds of games. End is good like I thinking."
2284,Squid Game,"Awesome series. Episode 6 my favorite 😘
Starting to end superb bond."
2285,Squid Game,You need to add player 324 as he has an important role.
2286,Squid Game,"This show started of interesting but in the end it was a let down. The characters became annoying and predictable and the story left too many questions unanswered. There is a difference between leaving the viewer wanting to know more and simply leaving too many blanks, in my opinion Squid Game did the latter.At the end, you've spent the entire season watching a miserable guy get kidnapped, beaten, everyone close to him killed and at the very end he leaves his child hanging once again. If this was a build up to a second season, I really don't care. I regret buying into the hype of watching this."
2287,Squid Game,"Episodes 1-6 were addictive, intense, original, clever and shocking. Genuinely incredible TV.Episodes 7-9 had some good twists but overall empty and missing that something special."
2288,Squid Game,"It's full of excitement and enthusiasm, I loved it so much."
2289,Squid Game,"This is a horror story, and I'm not normally a huge fan of the genre, which could make my read on it a bit uncharitable. However, it seems to present itself early on as more than just a horror story, which in my opinion it ultimately is not.Most of the plot outside of the titular games ends up culminating in a couple of twists that somehow both are predictable and make little to no sense in the context of the rest of the story.There is a lot to like here - stunning visuals, an eerie soundtrack, and plenty of solid performances in the early going. If you're in it for the survival horror of it all, this might be an entertaining thrill ride, and that's okay. For me, outside of a few well-delivered character moments early on, it played as a sloppily constructed piece of visual storytelling which spends most of its runtime on overlong, ultra violent, empty spectacle."
2290,Squid Game,Don't waste your time on this one. Whoever created this must have a very evil twisted minded.
2291,Squid Game,"This is a pure evil masterpiece to look inside of real human nature.Especially, it was very good social experiment in the episode 6."
2292,Squid Game,"Lot of movies/series are better than this one, can't write the movie/series name here which are way better then this as it will consider as spoiler, but honestly there is nothing like spoiler in this series.Lengthy unnecessarily.Well promoted by Netflix and team to get much more attention of viewers."
2293,Squid Game,"Amaziiiiing. Séries, the cast , the end , the games , the captain really it is the best series I have watched this year. Really thanks to netflix for this amazing series, I hope another season is coming soon , Thank youuuu."
2294,Squid Game,"I was honestly excited when I started the series, primarily because it was blowing up on social media. It did sound similar to Alice in Borderland (which had turned out be one my favourite series of all time), but I wanted to find out why it took off in the first place, when Alice in Borderland didn't receive nearly as much attention.Up until the tug-of-war episode, it seemed to be going okay. I think, for me, it peaked at the tug-of-war episode. But after that the whole series turned into a snooze fest. I mean, oh my god, it turned out to be so mind numbingly boring. And some areas were so blatantly copied from Alice in Borderland that I was shocked this series did not get slapped with a copyright. Ugh, such a waste of time. Honestly, if you've seen Alice in Borderland, don't bother watching Squid Game. The comparison is inevitable and it will leave behind a bitter taste."
2295,Squid Game,"Its a good series and I enjoyed it but the V. I. P s kinda ruins it. That's why I give it a 7, it was a really good series so I feel like they could have added something else then the V. I. P s."
2296,Squid Game,"Haven't enjoyed a series like this in a while. It's different and gets you instantly looked. The design and detail in the show is incredible, can't wait for season 2."
2297,Squid Game,"Very violent and disturbing series. I hoped I would understand the hype after pushing through to the end but also the ending is disappointing. You will watch desperate people doing anything for money, showing that you cannot trust anyone and at the end there's only 1 winner who won't change his life after being rich."
2298,Squid Game,"It's obvious that the idea of the games involving the lives of humans has appeared more than once in TV shows. Although the director has confirmed that the idea was planned many years ago, it's questionable that originality is one of its strengths. However, this series has made a different approach to the category, and for that reason I can understand its impact.The mixture of show and survival makes this story special. Involving emotions in tragic games transforms fear into treason, empathy into selfishness and hate into pain. Something that is usually complex to achieve. Social context plays an essential role in the series. Knowing the personal situations of the participants creates a vital link between the game and society. Best aspects? Feelings. Everything that this series could make you feel has a purpose and a reason. Almost every action of the characters is explainable in a certain way but also leaves you room for doubts and predictions about the next move. You won't get bored with the episodes, which is a priority among thrillers.Drawbacks? As I see it, the games ended faster than I was expecting. When you are risking your life, time seems to pass really slowly and in the series it happened all the opposite. For instance, I would have tried to enlarge the game scenes in the episodes. It's true that with this improvement your are risking the total timing, and perhaps it could become tiring, but that would be the best idea to take advantage of such a great plot. It would also have given the chance to extend a bit on the story of some characters that are relevant in the development of the series, which could be seen as one of the negative aspects, the lack of depth.All in all, it's such an excellent production, and I strongly recommend it without doubts."
2299,Squid Game,"The concept and idea of the game is pretty cool, but there are too many holes in the plot to be able to enjoy it as much as I should.Why did the old man vote to end it after the first game, when he was behind it all?Where did all the prize money and money to keep staff and facilities etc come from? Did the VIP's really sponsor with this amount of cash?Who are these people working there accepting all of this?How can these competitions have lasted for over a decade without any of them getting the story out?How could the organ harvester do this, with the trap doors in special furnaces etc. Without it being known by the front man?The idea of deathly competitions with child games are quite thought out and brilliant, except that there are games that really are not child games.However when trying to create the reason and background for all of it, it just feels flat and like a quick fix.The VIP's acting/script is just as horrible and flat as the story behind it all.I can still recommend people to watch it though!It still is quite exciting at times and the relationships are pretty well thought out!"
2300,Squid Game,I love this show and binged it in 2 days just to find everyone on TikTok getting views on it from cringe videos. The show itself was amazing and is a much watch but avoid TikTok.
2301,Squid Game,"I thought the only person who did not cheat would be the one who would win.But you kind of knew who it would be based on the focus on the one character but still! Also, I thought one of the gamblers could have been a previous winner, but maybe that's too easy?Still a good show, hoping the 2nd season just as good."
2302,Squid Game,"I finished. And San Ghi Khun is annoying me. He annoyed me in the start of show and in the end. He won, yes he lost a lot of dearest people, but anyway he has his daughter and like always he didn't choose his family and maybe last person who loves him. He go around and went on a game. For the revenge idk or for something else. But i think he did wrong choice."
2303,Squid Game,"I found the excessive amount of violence and extended shooting scenes completely unnecessary
specially for a 2021 production. Was that all really necessary? I fast forwarded most of them. Surely, the message 'people will do anything for money' could have been demonstrated and communicated in a more smart and artistic way. Squid Game really made me think that movies and TV shows should be regulated on the content and duration of violent scenes, to prevent viewers from adopting violent behaviors themselves and become trigger happy. I didn't see the value at all in showing hundreds of people been shot for minutes. The violence in this production was so raw, it was just distracting until the very end and ruined a potentially good script."
2304,Squid Game,"My favourite series is squid game . This is a drama, Thriller,action Serie . It's a South Korean created and directed by Hwang dong Hyun . The original release was on September 17, 2021 . The leading characters are Jung Ho yeon (sea-byeok) , Oh young -soo (oh ii-nam) Jang deak-su (heo sung-tae) they are a player's in squid game the series have 9 episodes. The story is about 456 people indented. They playing children Game but if they lose they die . If one guy staying alive he win 45 billion wons. I think this series had a good potential . It's the only series I watched in my life and I love it."
2305,Squid Game,"It's a really deep message mixed with horror. I really loved it but it's tough to watch because it's so violent. If you're really empathetic it will mess with you. I think it's worth it tho, the message it's really important. I think it's a 10/10. Hope there's a second season. The actors are really good too, and the direction and effects."
2306,Squid Game,"So I loved it, got very addicted to it and watched it in 2 days (could of done it in a day but I'm a working adult). I was very much into it through it all until the 5th game and onwards... the 5th game was just a bit of a mess and we all knew who was going to end up getting through. Then the last 2 episodes turned into quite a confusion when 2 of the leads die and then the main characters goes off into the world with obvious PTSD and a huge bank account. Rewind a year and he goes to meet the old man who is still alive (no shock there) and then he dies... cool story. Then he has some sort of middle aged mental breakdown, dyes his hair red, managed to break the girls brother out of a kids home and adopt him to the other guys mum and then finds out squid game is still going and goes all dolally. All in all... is there a season 2?"
2307,Squid Game,"Watched the show in 2 days, i must admit, it is in fact quite bingeable. However, I'm confused as to what i saw versus the reception by the audience, as ""the most amazing and smart netflix-show ever created"". Did we watch the same show?Overall, the show is decent. It's not original, which it is (hopefully) not trying to be, the execution is solid (for the most part). Some of the games were pretty interesting, s.a. The dalgona candy game or the squid game.However, the show lacks a lot of development, considering for how long its is, and has major plot problems: the storyline about dissection of the organs suddenly discontinued, i thought that was the whole point of these games? To gather a lot of bodies in order to dissect them and sell the organs. Nope, apparently not. Apparently, it's because some old man was bored on his death bead. In fact, nothing in the show was really explained, everyone's motivation seemed unclear and illogical in regard to what they were actually doing. I couldn't care for any of the characters, couldn't care for their death or their life or dynamic, couldn't care for the story of the two brothers, couldn't care for their interactions because they were all super super shallow.Conversations were super awkward, boring, dragged on for too long paired with a lot of severe and uncomfortable overacting by the actors. Tried to be extremely melodramatic in parts where it wasn't called for.Many other details didn't make sense or were just super unrealistic.The vips took the whole cake and ruined the show for good, but then the ending itself managed to suck even more.Well...i would definitely cut this show some slack, if it wasn't so well recieved. Come on guys, it's an okay show but definitely not the best Netflix show ever. People are calling it genius for foreshadowing the character's death when i could tell you 10 other shows that did it in the same way, as it is a common storytelling technique (and not original at that)I'm starting to think, people are pushing this show just because it is a Korean production, trying to make it out to be the best movie industry.Anyways, don't expect too much from this show, it's definitely overhyped and I'm glad i watched it early on, when it wasn't too popular yet."
2308,Squid Game,It was truly are very good movie I like that you must also go and see it very very funny and very very dramatic.It contains several thrilling dramatic and Furious scenes across the full series it was just in amazing experience to watch this movie.
2309,Squid Game,"The series had my attention gripped tight from episodes 1 - 7. If I would have stopped right there I would have given it a 9/10, but then episodes 8 and 9 happen.I findd Gi-Hun being mad at Sang-Woo for sacrificing the glasses guy just a dumb way to create conflict between the characters. Gi-Hun betrays his friend because he saved his life??? Gi-Hun just doesn't work as a main character, at the very end he barely grows as a character. Imagine how great it would have been if Sang-Woo had won the squid game and then have to live with the fact that he killed his friend, it would have made for a very dark yet introspective finale.I have mixed feelings towards the old man being the host of the games, it kinda ruins the Gganbu scene, but at the same time I like how deranged and twisted was his justification for starting the games.Gi-Hun leaving the airport to stop the games instead of visiting his daughter is kinda lame. It just felt like a cheap sequel-bait ending. Season 2 will likely be the typical ""small resistance group trying to take down the opressors"", and I'm tired of stories taking the same turn over and over again.I get that I'm complaining just because thigs didn't end the way I wanted, but don't you think it would have been more interesting if we had gotten a darker and conclusive ending rather than the one we got, which I think is kinda generic?"
2310,Squid Game,After a long time i enjoy such a type of great show really good tv series 9/10. I hooked up to this tv series till the end really a great show like game of thrones.
2311,Squid Game,"Apart from other reviews, this webseries is good and we can watch it for once. They could've made it better.Because one may feel lag at some scenes while watching and the games that they play are a bit interesting. You can enjoy this once But don't keep your expectations high coz eveybody dont feel the same.Few cons apart YOU CAN GO FOR IT."
2312,Squid Game,"Superb acting! Can´t remember when a Netflix Show made me almost cry.There are always certain episodes in TV Shows which make you think: This could be a rare example of something great. Something worth investing your time in.With the Sopranos, it was the ""Isabella"" episode that got me hooked. In this case it´s ""Gganbu""."
2313,Squid Game,"It was very emotional, when someone who supports you from start to end and when you have to eliminate him to Move further is really emotional the games was awesome the direction was good expect the cop dyeing The cop is showned so seriously that like he will definitely do something but he enters the island record everything get out of the Island and died from his brothers hand didn't expected this should be something different and player 001 was the best lvl twist, That two korean girl dyeing, soung woo played mind games with Ali was really good but for viewers that was most emotional moment and also When the main character wins all the money' but no one were with him everyone leave him alone His friend's His family His mother It also teach that money can't equal to happiness."
2314,Squid Game,Every action takes too long. Not that nice as the media say. Could be so much better. I didnt like it. More worth than one star but the everage will be better now😬
2315,Squid Game,"Honestly i haven't watched anything worse than this.I'm sure I'll never watch any Korean series again,the last episode is the worst. I feel sorry for myself for spending time on this. I hope he doesn't film the second season."
2316,Squid Game,"It was really, really good you should watch it but the couple of last episodes and the ending weren't really that good. But other than that don't let this deture you from watching this amazing show."
2317,Squid Game,"I'm not sure who are those people rating this show 10. It's just a bad low budget show with stolen visual and plot ideas, missing common sense in some scenes.Go watch some quality movies folks."
2318,Squid Game,There is the hint of classic music - morning alarm. I believe that Only Koreans realize this point. The classic music has been used background music of famous scholarship quiz show. The students compete each other and the winner gets the scholarship money prize. Therefore Koreans automatically feel that rat race would begin from this music.
2319,Squid Game,"Only childlike minds could be impressed following this cohort traipsing through the gauntlet of perturbing games. The acting is appalling, the dialogue is terrible and there is no human interest. The story is ridiculous. The odd shocking moment may keep you interested enough to watch to the end... if your bored enough. I'll admit though that it leaves an impression, probably a combination of its gratuitous violence and extreme subversive fantasy genre, hence the three stars."
2320,Squid Game,Said all in my topic. I literally love the main character and he is slightly heroic. Show is dynamic and humorous. As a big lover of anime and Asian cinematography I have to admit Asia with Europe are way better than USA momentary. Also I relaxed watching this because show didn't have any social warrior or political bul***.
2321,Squid Game,"Great satanic show, embraces beast consciousness. Slaves murder each other for mind control paper while master secretly watches and enjoys.Great show about the belief in authority, moral relativism and mind control money."
2322,Squid Game,Accept first 2 episodes rest of the series is outstanding and very engaging. Kind of must watch shows. It has nice twisy in every game and the climax is also superb.
2323,Squid Game,"A lackluster, unnecessarily dramatic, pointless pile of miserable garbage that unfortunately somehow managed to squeeze its way out of the directors large intestine onto the screen."
2324,Squid Game,"The first 6 episodes are quite strong but it unfortunately gets progressively worse afterwards. The awkward acting by the VIPs introduced in episode 7 was immersion breaking but could have been overlooked given that they are not a major part of the show. Otherwise the episode is still fine and provides satisfying conclusions to the stories of a few supporting characters.Episode 8 concludes the police investigation side plot which in my opinion was the weakest part of the show. We spend a lot of time with the young detective infiltrating the facility but we never get to know him very well, never see him grapple with his emotions or share his motivations with any of the other major characters. Here his story just sort of fizzles out. In the end he has done his job as a plot device revealing some of the evil organization's secrets to the viewer but hasn't actually accomplished anything. The other main characters never even learn he was there in the first place.Episode 8 also kills off Sae-Byeok who is either the show's most prominent side character or its least important main. Unfortunately it's a weak ending for her arc. She gets established as a resourceful badass in the first three episodes smuggling in a knife and crawling through air vents, but ends up being wounded through sheer dumb luck, then killed in a way that further builds the enmity between protagonist Gi-Hun and his childhood friend Sang-Woo. Her character seemed destined for more: If not survival and a reunion with her brother then at least a death more meaningful and less contrived.The ninth episode finally is maybe the weakest of the show. Our main character wins the games as expected and somewhat understandably spends a year wallowing in depression after his traumatic experiences. In a final plot twist it is revealed that Il-Nam, the old man seemingly suffering from dementia whom he has helped throughout the games up to his death (which it turns out he has faked), actually was the big bad all along, the organizer and host of the death games hundreds of people perished in. This obviously recontextualizes every interaction with him we have previously witnessed and in my opinion diminishes his story quite a bit. The story of an old man not willing to wait around for his death may be a bit of a cliche but it was still sad and well executed. As a villain Il-Nam is just another degenerate rich guy little more interesting than any of the other VIPs.Overall the show still has some very strong moments with episode 6 probably the best it ever gets. The final third still leaves a bad taste in my mouth though and brings down what maybe could have been a masterpiece."
2325,Squid Game,"The movie does a great job in making us feel relating to the characters, even though the plot is relatively simpler the performances and characters depth is exceptional."
2326,Squid Game,Amazing story and action and it holds up to everything i've heard. Suspenseful and allegorical but not too gory or horrific. It leaves it open enough to a second season and i would absolutely watch that.
2327,Squid Game,"""Squid Game"" does a great job of showing the effect of money on an individual's life worth and kindness. Director Hwang is able to convey this theme to the viewers through a diverse cast of characters who are introduced with varying levels of morality, but all share extreme financial instability. The characters enter a game where there is a 40 million dollar cash prize for a sole winner, with a gruesome twist of players getting killed if they are eliminated. Director Hwang created this scenario to portray ""capitalist society"" and ""the extreme competition of life"". Despite this the characters insist on continuing the game, as they believe their lives in the outside world are forfeit, with no chances to earn enough money to lead a dignified life. Here ""Squid Game"" does a good job illustrating how desperate the poor can be. However the belief that a life with money will bring happiness is something that's tested throughout the series.The audience then learns very quickly what kind of character thrives the most, as those willing to sacrifice others seem to win the games with ease while the more morally inclined struggle, having to choose between their own benefit or helping other players. Even the main character, Gi-hun, who is introduced to us as affectionate for others, comes to a point in the games where he decides to take advantage of his friend, only to feel terrible guilt. This demonstrates that in such competitive circumstances, good individuals begin to compromise their morality, losing people close to them on the way. The idea that the prize will bring closure becomes even more blurrier.Gi-hun survives, and is one of the two people to make it to the final game . The other being his childhood best friend who progressed by betraying other players. In a fight to the death Gi-hun refuses to kill his friend, who ends up comminting suicide due to guilt. Gi-hun wins the 40 million, but with no sense of meaning or kindness anymore willingly spends the rest of his life in poverty refusing to spend a single cent. Squid Game makes us ask if achieving success alone in an individualistic and competitive society is worth the people we already have around us. In this regard it does a great job as a social commentary as it shows the desperation of the poor, how morality can be compromised, and the guilt that comes with taking advantage of others.Project: Gabriel extracts deeper meaning from a TV show based on winning money for a series of dangerous games such as the desperation of the poor, the tension between money and happiness, and ultimately."
2328,Squid Game,"The worst. I truly feel gaslighted by the hype around this series. It's like i question myself if somehow am lacking some kind of sense or understanding to get the hype! There is nothing i could enjoy - firstly the cultural differences are to big to fully understand if they act bad or if the wild gesturing and shouting is normal in that cultur. From my point of view it looks like bad acting. The Plot is so, so, so boring, have been told a thousand times and always was boring. Then the actual storytelling is like it's done by a student or so. So many plot holes and dead ends."
2329,Squid Game,"It was OK. Didn't find myself totally hooked. Sometimes predictable, sometimes a bit surprising.Social criticism? Sure. Social criticism on a ""wow-level""? Not really. But there's definitely a lot of things in there to discuss."
2330,Squid Game,"In terms of story, there's nothing. The last two episodes are highly disappointing. The show has lot of loop holes. The final reveal and the reasoning seems stupid."
2331,Squid Game,I have only started to watch but am I really supposed to care what happens with this trash of a person who steals from his mother to gamble? Because I don't.
2332,Squid Game,An endlessly creative story that keeps you emotionally invested until the end. I could not get over how shocking and provocative the content was. There were times I felt horrified and times I felt extremely light but mostly I just THOUGHT.
2333,Squid Game,Nothing about this series was special. Its stupid that this show got so popular. There are a million shows who followed this formula that is so much better. A lot say its a new concept well its not.
2334,Squid Game,"New favorite show! It takes a few episodes to get into but it gets so good! The characters, the plot, everything is amazing! Highly highly recommend watching it with subtitles inside of it being dubbed. Pls pls pls watcg it it is 100% worth it."
2335,Squid Game,"Adrenaline rush. Binged watched it like crazy. Definitely a must watch. I never really liked any Korean movies or series, this has changed the entire perspectives."
2336,Squid Game,It's an overhyped Series. Maybe they have got an excellent marketing team who made this possible. It's sad to see that this show broke the records of really good shows that are deserving. The concept was nothing new of you watch too many animes.
2337,Squid Game,"As I started to watch the show, in the first couple of episodes I could predict how the storyline will go. Especially the end. Acting was good, I guess. Characters are adults yet their behavior and social skills are equivalent those of a 5 years old child.Actors did good, that is why it's 2 stars.Nothing new, nothing special."
2338,Squid Game,"Off the bat, I enjoyed it a fair bit. I just don't think that the hype that was made around it was based on an ""amazing story"" or anything like that. I think it is a mixture of the intense bloody/gorey scenes and the political statements about capitalism (I believe, this is just something I have seen people talking about based on the show). It definitely has a decent story, but at times the plot armor dulls the intensity of the story down because you sort of know how something will end up."
2339,Squid Game,"I loved this series. But the one downsize is that it was obvious from episode 4 the identity of the cop's brother. I really hope season 2 focuses on him because we were left with so many unanswered questions. The vip's were horrible. Their english was bad too but hey, how many times american actors butchered italian, spanish or french?? Always. I can't even watch the goodfather cause it gives me a headache when they speak ""in italian"". It's true that americans are very ignorant but still."
2340,Squid Game,I enjoyed this Netflix series but at time found my self thinking they could have come up with better Childhood games to play during the course of the show. By time time they get geared up to play ALLEYS i was totally loosing interest.The People behind the entire charade wasn't really a surprise but it was fine.And i am happy there probably making season 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.....etc YA RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!
2341,Squid Game,"The show was really entertaining and kept me on my toes. However, I think that some episodes were inconsistent, and the ending was awful. Maybe it should have been a movie instead of a show."
2342,Squid Game,I definitely recommend this show if you like some gore and some strategy and action shows. This actually has some twists and turns that really make you rethink the previous episodes content.
2343,Squid Game,"I've watched Korean Dramas since my 17 years old and finally the world understands how powerful they are. The story, the acting... PERFECT. They have the hability to make you feel all the emotions at once."
2344,Squid Game,At first I thought it wad boring because of the first episode but after it just became really interesting. And there is on scene which us for adults so if your kids did start watching Squid Game then don't let them see this scene.
2345,Squid Game,"I think the reason why other shows are really fun is that the writers give the viewers time to understand each character and fall in love with them.Have to admit, didn't get that from this, it's so straight to the point, azin there are no past memories of any of the characters before they started playing, how there life was. Apart from showing us how they were all in need of money, you at least had to show something of the past friendship of Gi-Hun and Shang-Woo.On top of that, it really disturbing how the main point is killing one another, yet we all know the main part is money. Show more of how the money is supposed to be used than giving us all the silly ways of killing one another. Seriously a fake glass bridge come on, was this inspired by some of the jigsaw movies.The attire is simply copied from la casa de papel, you should have gone for some original and different.And don't get me started with the blood effects, come on that was too much blood. For someone to be realising all that blood after a gun shot, he must be carrying like 20 litres of blood.What happens after incenarating the bodies, do they just vanish like what of their families, you mean no one even notices that there loved ones are missing? Apart from Jun-Ho the only person who appears to be missing he's brother?Where do they even take the extra beds of the eliminated players, dump them in the waters....😅
This show is overated have seen better.Allow me ask was the movie sponsored by PlayStation 🤣
And the last fighting scene, should have hired stuntmen, it's not dynamic at all."
2346,Squid Game,"Squid Game is a south-korean series that contains 9 episodes is one series.The creator of the program is Hwang Dong-Hyeok, the genre of the serie is drama , horror. Thriller .The story is about people in financial difficulty being invited to a mysterious survival competition.Participating.in a series of children's games but with deadly twists, they risk their lives for a large sum of money.I liked this series because it is intriguing, we want to continue the episodes to know what will happen."
2347,Squid Game,"This series was one of the best series I saw. Acceptable story rhythm and great characterization make you connect with the characters. The excitement and drama of the series is also great. Of course, there are flaws in the series, but the strengths of the series make its weaknesses not visible at all."
2348,Squid Game,"I already watched squid game and it's boring
This series just cheap copy of Gods Wills and Hunger Games also plot are predictable and people dying for no reason they keep breaking their own rules and ending of this series is kinda silly."
2349,Squid Game,"All the characters are well written and you can relate with most of them, I really liked the role of Jun - ho as it gave us the perspective of the guards too and not just the players. The director and the actor who played the role of Ali did a great job in making you cry. Heo Sung - tae really made us hate his character. The actor who played Cho Sang - Woo also did a great job along with the hero. There are lots of surprises at the end which are like cherry on top. I recommend you all to watch it and I can't wait for season 2."
2350,Squid Game,"For a Korean series, this is very out of the norm. This series takes down all of the taboo which South Koreans are known for. Guns, death, gore and sexual content all rolled in this series.I've watched many K-Dramas in my life and I have to say that this is one of the best. Great story telling, great acting, awesome plot.Im glad K-Drama is getting the international recognition is deserves. Main stream America.Kudos Netflix for having more K-Drama content."
2351,Squid Game,"Squid Game is an drama and thriller series it was directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk the series stars Jung Ho-yeon and Wi Ha-joon who play the role of Kang Sae-byeok and Hwang Jun-ho. It was realeased on netflix in 2021. As of now, 1 seasons and 9 episodes are available. The lending caracter are Hwang Jun-ho. It is set in korea.It is a story of poor peapol make a game for win the money. In the game when your loose your die. During this series you follow the adventure off Hwang Jun-ho. This series is realy interresting and is one of the best success of 2021 in netflix."
2352,Squid Game,I love the climax. The story was so good. Recommendation for watch. Highly appreciate. The film setup was also good. Right now waiting for next episode.
2353,Squid Game,"This is our society.If you want to see a nice series, choose it.This film is full of meaning and concept of our current society in which we live. We are all in some kind of bad situation like this."
2354,Squid Game,"Just as the title reads. This series is an emotional ride on every single level, and I believe there is so much an actor can convey in a scene that transcends language. After finishing the series I checked out the English dubbed version and it was painful to watch; all of that powerful tone, inflection, emotion - gone and replaced by poorly-acted robotic American voices. These actors are extremely talented and you deserve to experience their performance to the fullest extent possible. Watch the Korean version - it will enrich your viewing experience greatly.The hype around this show was so intense that I went in assuming my expectations wouldn't be met - and they were far exceeded. It's difficult for me to put into words how fantastic I thought this series was, but it wow'ed me on every level. The sets are absolutely mesmerizing, the score is haunting, the acting is superb, the characters are flawed and complex, and the storyline(s) are very well thought-out. I keep finding myself returning to Netflix/YouTube to rewatch scenes from the show because they struck me so deeply. I hope for a 2nd season, I'd love to watch regardless of which direction it goes in!! Absolutely mind blowing show.I would use caution if you are sensitive to death & violence. Even if you're not terribly sensitive either, to be honest. This show doesn't hold back!"
2355,Squid Game,"It's just the opposite of ""Crazy Rich Asians"". Worth the watch if you got the time to spare. Not the best tv show of all time, but 100% worth your time if you are looking for a new show to binge watch!"
2356,Squid Game,Very addictive and entertaining! It has a great storyline. Absolutely Loved it.!! All characters have their unique identity and acts superbly well.Must Watch!!
2357,Squid Game,"Nothing extra ordinary about this Korean series, found it overhyped & overrated 😴 could have been better than this. Actors did a good job, but overall a 5 star series."
2358,Squid Game,"Darling, this series is great. I advise you in a way that I advise you to film and direct, but I did not like the deliciousness +18. I hope you did not repeat it in the second season of the series."
2359,Squid Game,"I decided to watch Squid Game under strange circumstances. I live in a small town in Eastern Europe. One day, while shopping in a local supermarket, I was approached by two young people (school-age), who asked me if I wanted to play a Squid Game. I had heard of the Netflix hit, so instantly made the association, but ultimately, my reply was: sorry, don't have time for silly games. The moment we parted ways, however, I knew *what* I was going to watch that evening..I can only guess why youngsters like Squid Game. Is it finding strength in numbers? A desire to be part of a clandestine network? Gory scenes one would find in many a video game? A prospect of ""easy"" money that challenges the traditional, education-based route to success? I don't know.For me, Squid Game is first and foremost a vivid reminder about human nature that hasn't really changed much since ancient times. Generally in life, but especially in a free-for-all, expect lots of backstabbing and underhand dealings. People will lie, change allegiances and exploit others' weaknesses, including their sense of morality, to further own interests. Not everyone is like that, of course, or not like that all the time. Squid Game illustrates this point pretty well imho, just as it does force people to think about things in life that matter the most: is it money? Family? Adrenalin? Love?"
2360,Squid Game,It's a series with action and suspense. The main actor is short of money and decides to participate in a game to earn some. The main actor is called Lee Jung-jae and of Korean origin.
2361,Squid Game,"A work of art without creativity, with the idea stolen from films such as Platform and Cube, its only beauty is the good acting of its actors. Netflix has only visited this series with false advertisements."
2362,Squid Game,It has new concept which is shown amazingly by the director. The plot twists are amazing & director ends it in a very good way. It is worth watching. Please watch every episode . Definitely worth it!!Bye!!
2363,Squid Game,"Pretty sad what the film industry has come too. Everyone praises this show but anyone with a brain can realize they copied every aspect of fall guys. Red light green light is literally just a copy of the whirlygig and the mechanics of the show copy those of fall guys. When the beans fall in fall guys that's like the people getting shot in Squid Game. The only significant change is they replaced crowns with money, but anyone could have thought of that. A cheap knockoff of fall guys."
2364,Squid Game,"How to die is more essential than how to survival in this kind of death game series!!!! I believe Ji-Young, Il-Nam, Sang-woo... are real main characters in this drama."
2365,Squid Game,"Leader in downloads and viewing. The series that overshadowed many Hollywood projects. I couldn't not watch The Squid Game! But he wasn't in any particular hurry, although a high-quality version appeared almost immediately after the release. What were the expectations? Well, I was expecting something bloody, like ""Survival Games"", or ""Hunger Games"". Of course, with Korean specifics. In general, I started watching, assuming in advance that I would see a high-quality spectacle!My expectations were justified! What pleased me the most was that the series had meaning, and not just stupid gore. Yes, yes, it is! Once again, I was convinced that there are problems in Korea too. But nevertheless... And the main of those very problems is the stratification of society. There are many very poor, and at the same time there is a snickering stratum. This is familiar, right?There are many central events in the series. It is possible, however, to single out the main point. It's Song Ki-hoon, not a particularly pretty guy who's in big trouble. By coincidence, Gi-hun observes a certain game in which there is a large cash prize and in which the same poor fellows as our hero appear. But what will be the price?It immediately became clear that this film is quite violent. Well, expended never repels. What surprised me is that the characters are exaggerated (don't forget that the series is Korean) and even more, they are all charismatic! Remember the heroes! Song Gi-hoon, grandpa, thief girl, gangster, Pakistani... Well, or almost none, because after all, many faces were purely Korean...I'm not as observant as some of the individuals who have previously viewed Squid. Therefore, I would not have guessed about some moments, honestly. But we have well-wishers, I won't watch, who spoiled almost the entire viewing for me, thereby reducing the ""tastyness"" of the spectacle. No, in any case, I liked the series and there were still surprises.What else to highlight? Perhaps I will note the games themselves, which were invented by the organizers of the show. I don't even know which one is highlighted. I liked everything!Why did the series become secret? Popular and well-known even when broadcasting Russian football matches? It's just organic in everything, there are no redundant episodes, the action is dynamic, and it's never boring to watch. The shape of employees with triangles, circles and squares on the face, in general, will soon become well distributed and really hype! There are cult films, serials less often. ""Brigade"", ""Game of Thrones"" ... Perhaps I don't remember more. ""Playing Squid"" can hardly be attributed to this category, although who knows, after a few years, let's say, maybe the point of therapeutic treatment ...I look forward to the second season, which will most likely be. Of course, there are a lot of new features in acceptable completeness. I recommend watching this high-quality Korean series!"
2366,Squid Game,"Why can't we tear ourselves away from watching this series? The series has a very correct structure - one series - one game. There are no episodes where only conversations are shown, for example. There is always some action that keeps you in suspense.The picture is colorful. Let's start with the fact that all the actors (participants of the game) are dressed in green suits. The location they are in always changes colors. In the first game - some colors, in the second - others, etc.The plot itself is quite new for Russia, I don't remember such series.Koreans are a very expressive people in themselves, and this expressiveness hyperbolizes all the emotions they experience during the series. For example, fear of death, anger, hatred. The viewer feels all this very well.I would especially like to highlight the negative character Dogsu (I think that's his name). A very cool actor who aroused the contempt of all the viewers, turned out to be white and fluffy in life (take a look at his Instagram).The ending is quite unexpected, the series claims for the second season unequivocally.In general, it's definitely worth watching! The series so far has 1 season with 9 episodes that risk being watched in 1 night."
2367,Squid Game,"An interesting plot, shows the real life of people who love to play, are ready for anything for the sake of money. The protagonist wants to earn money to provide for his daughter, whom he wants to see more often than he can at the moment."
2368,Squid Game,"Netflix has released a new Korean series about a deadly rivalry between people - ""The Squid Game"". A man in a black mask gathered 456 people in a hangar on the island. All of them are in need, someone has lost all their property, and some also owe the bank. The prize, $40 million, will go to those who make it to the end. In total, participants will have to go through six competitions, the plots of which are taken from children's games.This series seems to be exploiting the hackneyed theme of survival games again, but it has several features. For starters, The Squid Game is really exciting - the games are made very cool and on a large scale. There are many players here, however, with each round their number will fall, but nevertheless, the viewer is immediately offered a huge set of characters. To make it easier, each of them is assigned a profile that they play out: a wise old man, a ruthless bandit, a good-natured migrant from Pakistan. The heroes here resemble game avatars with sets of preset characteristics."
2369,Squid Game,"""The game of squid"" - promoted and
overrated series. He quickly picked up his
popularity thanks to social networks, but
just as quickly forgotten by the audience. He is different
unbelievable cruelty and
paintings. While watching constantly
you are under psychological stress.The ending of the movie is not clear at all.Hero's action. I do not recommend."
2370,Squid Game,"Classic battle royale, interesting to see new challenges, each of them does not give an obvious answer to the passage. The theme of harsh capitalism is raised.In general, I liked it, but interpersonal relationships are not fully disclosed."
2371,Squid Game,"I have to be honest, the first episode was not easy for me. It was terribly tedious and drawn out. At times I couldn't stand it and skipped a bit, especially during those endless dialogues about the same thing. It takes patience to keep watching the series.Plus, when the actors in leading roles are unsympathetic, the negative impression is reinforced.By the way, such tedious and drawn-out episodes occur throughout the series.Although there are moments that keep the viewer impatient."
2372,Squid Game,"Like most, I watched the series back in the fall. This is a case when you look to understand the memes around you, the entire feed was filled with them, as you remember. And I had a similar case with 'JoJo's Bizarre Adventure' and I liked that series. And 'The Squid Game', as you understand by the color of the review, is not very good.The plot is built around the fact that people who are in a difficult social situation participate in the game of survival. Tests are an imitation of children's games. As a result, one will survive and receive money for all the dead, which in the end will be about five hundred.In general, the plot of the beloved genre is the battle royale, which we know from the 'Royal Battle' (which gave the genre its name), 'Running Man', 'The Hunger Games', etc. And from the pluses, one can immediately note the non-triviality of the authors in their approach to staging and testing: the costumes of the organizers are bright and memorable, the games are creative and, in general, yes, it turned out very memetic. No wonder the series became so viral and it was watched by those who are not interested in either Korean cinema or battle royale. Another plus, the series has a straightforward morality and the goal in this regard, he intelligibly fulfills with criticism of modern society. Despite the fact that he is a South Korean, the problems are clear to any inhabitant of the world. And I will additionally highlight that no matter how unpleasant the series was to me in the end, he managed to lure and hold, the scenes of the games look as intense as possible and hold.Now to the cons, and they are mostly plot, and therefore I will try to be as veiled as possible so as not to spoil the potential viewing experience. There is an unexpected twist in the last episode, and the meaning of any unexpected twist is that you not only be surprised, but also look at the picture differently, that is, when you review it, you see hints that this is not a twist for the sake of a twist, but a conscious idea. 'The Squid Game' didn't work out because it didn't happen in the course of the series, and therefore when an unexpected turn occurs, it doesn't look like a reason to rethink what happened, but as a reason to ask the creators the question: 'Are you delusional or what?'. It looks so stupid in the last episode. And although the games are fascinating, the fact that between them on the 4th series is already of little interest, and therefore you begin to notice stupidity, sort of why they raised the alarm when shooting; why the undercover cop didn't call for help when he could; why, when there was a connection, the cop did not throw off evidence, etc. Plus, although I praised the series for its intelligible and straightforward thought with criticism of modern society, but the series has a secret society and it is so caricatured that instead of fear, which should have been, judging by the music, it causes only a smile and this is not the best way for the atmosphere working.In general, the reasons why the series became so popular are understandable, and here the high expectation played a cruel joke with me personally, because when you see that something is so popular, you to a certain extent expect that the work will be something above the level than everything else. And as a result, my feelings from the series were as follows: at first they waved a candy in front of my nose, I swallowed it, by the middle I feel that it is spoiled, and by the end I understand that they fed me waste products, not candy, and it's a shame. I recommend it to those who have not watched any movie from the battle royale genre, the rest, if you have more baggage of watched films than most viewers and you know and have seen a similar genre, then 'The Squid Game' will be boring at best, disappointing at worst ."
2373,Squid Game,"I don't like Korean TV series, but this is the first one that just won me over! Although it is a drama, but during the viewing it is not felt at all, the theme of the tragedy here is not what the director clings to. By the way, an interesting fact, the director wrote the script for about 10 years, in fact, this is his whole life's work. I also received a lot of rejections from film studios. The film is interesting, the acting is also at the highest level, I highly recommend watching it!"
2374,Squid Game,"Recently watched the series ""The Squid Game"". At first, he was skeptical when people talked about him from every angle. Then my wife persuaded and we decided. Watched it in one breath in two nights. I agree, a lot of blood and meat, but the idea is very exciting, the ending is generally unpredictable. The actors are chosen and performed brilliantly. Special respect to the 001st."
2375,Squid Game,"I watched the series in one breath! How many plot twists and turns, interesting references.The cast is great, the script is very interesting. It's impossible to stop at one episode! In addition to the dynamics, the series raises important social issues, for example, poverty and wealth. The ending was unexpected for me."
2376,Squid Game,"The Squid Game rooted us in our own truth: we, too, enjoy watching this cruel and uncomfortable act. What will be the next game? Who will survive? We also choose our favorite and hope that it will go as far as possible. But that's not all, in the drama, for once, naked female breasts appear. Not that it's really necessary, but it's long past time for South Korea to finally dare to show off anything other than hundreds of well-built male torsos. And what a rarity to see a non-Korean actor in a Korean series. Anupam Tripathi, an Indian, asserts himself with touching and benevolent naivete, denouncing Korean society for distrust of foreigners, as well as precarization and discrimination against immigrant workers. It would seem that these are insignificant trifles, but it is precisely from such radical decisions that the success of this puzzle is formed."
2377,Squid Game,"When watching the series, you wonder: would you agree to the game if you were as desperate and mired in debt as the main characters? The harsh reality pushes people to participate in the game. The managers list their huge debts, the viewers are constantly shown poor apartment interiors, meager food, the general tightness in which the heroes of the series live, goosebumps run from this picture. And you are looking forward to how the chronology of the plot will develop furtherIt is also possible to note the excellent overall style of the series. The game in the series is visually thought out to the smallest detail. Players, supervisors and even unexpected guests wear special uniforms, all interiors are minimalistic and sterile, without a single superfluous item. The authors observe the unity of style. For this respect to them.Each character in the series has its own personality. During the game, the characters show themselves from the real side. And it's very interesting to watch. In parallel, you think, what would you do in their place? Would you do everything for your own benefit or would you help your friends?Even fairly predictable plot twists are executed perfectly in the series. From the survival game, it is logical to expect non-standard, dishonest behavior of the heroes - betrayal, deception, even murder for the sake of victory. But for these plot twists, the most unexpected characters are used. At the same time, not a single plot move raises questions about the logic and plausibility of what is happening.I recommend watching the ""Squid Game"", first of all, to fans of the genre. It's a solid thriller. In conclusion, I would like to say that the series has become popular all over the world for a reason, has earned awards and high critical acclaim. There's a lot to see here."
2378,Squid Game,"A few months have passed since the Squid Game hype. I still can't forget the intensity and the stories in the Squid Game.It depicts the dark side of society and the misery of common people's lives, so real and yet dramatic at the same time. I think every viewer finds one's self in the show that he/ she feels most attached to."
2379,Squid Game,"Beautifully directed, the cinematography is stunning. No spoilers here, but the drama and character development is sensitivity done, and there are some great reveals. You'll love it."
2380,Squid Game,"Hwang Dong-hyuk, a Korean writer-director, created a horrific series out of greed, terror, gambling impulse, and social disparities. This is the series Squid Game. It is a South Korean TV series released in 2021 and has 1 season. Squid Game has turned out to be Netflix's biggest hit.This series is about playing real-life children's games where horrific punishments could be carried out for the slightest mistake. It takes place in South Korea where a mysterious organization invites 456 players who are in some form of debt to play a game. Winning this game would grant them a huge amount of money. The main character is Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a divorced chauffeur and gambling addict who still lives at home with his mother. He is one of the 456 misfits who plays the game in order to solve his life problems.One of the great things about this series is that you feel connected to the series. Most of us have played some sort of children's game before which helps us feel that this might be real. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the game begins. You can't help but be impressed at the shocking moment of first game. As the series progresses, the background of some of these characters is slowly revealed. The suspense builds up as new games are introduced, each with their own rules. The characters use wits, weapons, power and other means necessary in order to advance through the game.Squid Game was one of the most intricately exciting shows that I have watched until now. As the series was released during Covid, its popularity skyrocketed. Due to Covid we hear about death all the time and we feel restricted due to lockdown which is familiar to the series. The plot is detailed and mysterious while also being annoyingly predictable. The beyond phenomenal acting, coupled with captivating set design is enough to evoke emotions of excitement and thrill in viewers. This show has something for everyone; it's dramatic, emotional, comedic, and mysterious. This series vividly showcased the fear, greed and gambling instinct in humans to a great extent. It's sheer outrageousness and aesthetic awe are enough to make an impression. There were multiple cases of people reenacting some of the 'games' portrayed in this series. My one complaint was the main character who was painfully annoying throughout the series.I am impressed by the novelty of this series. When all of the mysterious and well-thought-out aspects are combined, this series becomes so intriguing that you can't help but binge-watch the entire season. Some may believe that some content is confusing since it has been translated from Korean to English. However due to the excellent work of the people behind the scenes all of the details are preserved. I must say that this is a must watch series. If you have free time and nothing to do you must watch Squid Game."
2381,Squid Game,"This felt like yet another Korean remake of a popular Japanese TV show and/or movie (which itself was originally a manga) -- The movie in question is, ""As The Gods Will"" which came out in Japan back in 2014. Sure, they changed just enough so as to avoid any messy legal IP/copyright issues, but let's not pretend this movie is an original idea.I personally don't mind remakes, especially with foreign films being localized for a different audience (& culture). I just don't like it when try to pass off the remake as their original idea.As far as the show itself goes, it wasn't bad. I rather liked it, and liked the fact it was a TV show instead of a movie -- with a TV show you get more time to explore the world & characters. Acting was OK, cinematography was excellent and the writing wasn't bad either. I'd definitely recommend this movie to friends."
2382,Squid Game,"Enjoyable show, the games were cool, marble episode is superior. Stuff leading up to the ending was nice but the actual ending was a letdown. Regardless it was a fun ride, however the vip people were god awful."
2383,Squid Game,Awesome series.jsuusisissiissiisishdggdgdgsggwhwhahbsbsbsvvsvdgsgsggsgsjqjajjwjshshshjejejjejehhshshsggdgsnennenebenejejwjjwjwujwbdbxbbxvxvxvxvbxbxbehwhywuwhqbwbbwbebebebvdgduhshshsu.
2384,Squid Game,Definitely gives viewers a good look at what people who are struggling financially with major problems are willing to do for money as well as what people with too much money are willing to do for entertainment. Planned on writing how absolutely nauseating the VIP's were in their acting abilities but SO many people beat me to it. Seriously the dialogue was so awful I was actually getting irritated whenever they were on screen and the delivery would have sounded more human if it had been robotic voices. They manage to grate on your nerves while completely taking you out of the story.
2385,Squid Game,"I don't understand why all the hype, it's just a poor story with a lot of cold blooded killing, our society has become so cruel. And It's just The Platform revamped."
2386,Squid Game,"Another series were it keeps you on your toes, but then the ending has you scratching your head. Why?????"
2387,Squid Game,"-The attraction of the series is to play with the morbidity of the viewer.-Why the bad guys are always the strongest, or the richest, or the most something; and the good ones are the weakest, etc, etc?-The argument of perverted rich men who pay for strange things, is already very used.-Just lives who was supposed to survive?-Who put the stretcher in such a strange place? There are no nurses, no doctors, no bathroom?-And if the poor guy wasn't there, then what would they get together? To listen to the radio?-Finally, the rules of the squid game are not even easy to understand.**Entertaining, and raises the moral question of whether or not one breaks his principles to survive, but gives 5 points .. Many defects and some successes."
2388,Squid Game,"The title about sums it up. The games/horror were the only thing that kept me intrigued and watch till the end, but the outcome of the series was very predictable. The rest was overrated to say the least.The acting in general, but especially the curly haired lady was so awful it made me think i was watching amateur theathre for kids. If you look up the definition over ""overacting"" it'll have her picture on it. It actually muted the parts with her, to try and keep the show somewhat credible.Another example of terrible typecasting = the american VIP's... I cringed myself through these scenes..."
2389,Squid Game,"1. Too many plot holes
2. No character development
3. Might be visually entertaining
4. A potentially good stroy
5. An absolutely weak scenario
6. Mediocre acting
7. Predictable
8. One of the worst endings ever
9. Too cliché
10. Mostly too rediculous."
2390,Squid Game,"Squid Games main concept has been done before: The Hunger Games, the Running Man, Surviving the Game, to name a few. That in itself isn't a fatal flaw, T2 was a great movie, and I loved True Grit 2010 for instance. This series, however, seemingly makes a point out of presenting tired tropes. It manages to pack not one, but two predictable ""shocking"" character reveals in the same season (the first season at that!).Possibly even more annoying is that the production consistently chooses effect over composition. It goes out of it way to do the aforementioned character reveals, which are neither warranted by nor very consequential to the the story. And it is littered with quirky details or poorly explained elements. It's fixation on memeable elements reminded me of some of the work of Zack Snyder, and not in a good way. Pulp Fiction isn't a fantastic movie because Jules has a wallet that says ""Bad Mother"". Pulp Fiction is a great story that seamlessly fits in Jules' absurd wallet, and looks cool doing it.Perhaps most fatal of all, it fell short of making me root for anyone. Most of the characters are one dimensional or complete stereotypes. Even though the main protagonist was sort of relatable, and I did appreciate Song-Woo's development.That being said, it is full of action and packed to the brim with quirky trinkets. Unless you are a big fan of say Jesse Eisensbergs Lex Luthor, I'd say, save yourself 6 to 7 hours and go watch Battle Royale (again)."
2391,Squid Game,"Slow developing and boring story, boring actors that over-react. Squid Game is just over-hyped. Would not recommend wasting your time."
2392,Squid Game,"It was very good and thrilling at the beginning, but on episode 6 I noticed how long the dialogues and things were taking and I actually fell asleep because it was tedious. For some reason I didn't even get emotional on that episode, just felt like some things didn't even make sense.From that on, I was more interested on the police officer's plot than actually the games. And this is another thing that didn't even get closure. If you're not certain there'll be another season, you can't just let things unfinished.The ending didn't get me and somethings didn't make sense (like that hair?). It was obvious his mother would be dead by the time he got home, I knew it since episode 2.There are some CLEAR nods (maybe even copy?) to The Hunger Games movies, such as the song that is played to the characters (even though it's a classic song, it was very clearly copying the Panem Anthem idea), the score soundtrack of the series while the game is going on (very similar to the movies), even some camera shots and the VIPS watching the games and betting on players. Even the ending was similar, only it wasn't a Peeta the second contestant.It was an ok show, it would be more fun to watch if the dialogues were more direct and things happened faster."
2393,Squid Game,"I like the series but feel so disappointed with the ending. He earned so much money and instead of helping his family and daughter, he wants to become Batman and save the world. I am super disappointed."
2394,Squid Game,Acting 3/10. Story 1/10. Visuals 6/10. Feels like a B rated holywood movie from the 80s. Is it reddit or 4chan behind the hype again?
2395,Squid Game,"If you can get past the dubbing, this is a brilliant nail biter...unlike anything I have seen before...I would HIGHLY recommend."
2396,Squid Game,"Slow-paced. Tedious. Has story lines that don't forward the narrative and story lines that simply do not belong and could be cut entirely. If you've seen a Tarantino movie, you've seen more ""blood and gore."" There's not much suspense. It's a commentary on capitalism and human nature that could have been told in 3 hours. If you are watching the first episode or two thinking the story will pick up -- it won't."
2397,Squid Game,"Starting off ok, but when the game itself starts it turns into a sadistic slo-mo splatter fest. Cheap. Sadly enough this show is probably captivating for a large audience who prefers graphic violence and simple mind games before good storytelling. This could have been so much better..."
2398,Squid Game,Watch Anime like Kaiji or Gambling Emperor Zero and you find way smartes mindgames. Those squid games are just cheap and easy with no real solution behind it.Just a ripoff.
2399,Squid Game,"This show was pretty cool in terms of the players and the games, but that only accounted for maybe 30% of the show in its entirety. I absolutely could not have cared less about all the behind the scenes storylines."
2400,Squid Game,"Couldn't think of a better show, I didn't sleep once through the whole thing, didn't even leave my seat!!!"
2401,Squid Game,Why is this cast list so effed up? Second billing Gi-hun is NOT Gi-hun and that for sure is not Ali.
2402,Squid Game,"I didn't like the series. It doesn't make any sense. I would rather see a series with 20 or 30 seasons about the life of José Castelo Branco. Too ridiculous series, I don't understand how people like this dump!"
2403,Squid Game,"Parasite, Saw, Hunter X Hunter, Cube, Black Mirror, The Platform, Oldboy... Takeshi's Castle?An unexpected mix of all my favourite things - Squid Game is the best thing I've watched this year.An intriguing premise that actually delivers. I went in with no expectations and was blown away!"
2404,Squid Game,"I loved it. Right up to the vips, which were pathetic, however didn't ruin the show too much.Well worth the binge on a Saturday night."
2405,Squid Game,"The dark side of Humanity comes to life within games from our childhood, with a twist...You get inside the head and Origin of each character and what bright they to this incredible moment.An excellent show from start to finish."
2406,Squid Game,"This show is a masterpiece, very deep in many aspects, the only negative aspect are the VIP's."
2407,Squid Game,"The first episode was gripping and then it just plods along with predictable characters, bad or over acting and a waiver thin, seen it all before plot line. I gave up at ep 3..and seriously doubt it would be as popular without the mass shootings. Enough."
2408,Squid Game,"So much is lost in translation any time a film/show is translated into another language. Some productions do a better job than others to remedy this, Squid Game however, doesn't. Let's not even bother with the English Dub of the show, it is absolutely TERRIBLE voice acting and is evident that these the English actors for this show do not specialize in voice acting. Little to no character context, paired with a basic storyline(if you can call it that), senseless killing, and poor acting made these 8 episodes extremely difficult to make it through. There was nothing to keep me ""on the edge of my seat"" or remotely in my seat for that matter.If you've been contemplating watching it, don't. Don't waste ~6 hours of your life, there are much better shows out there to watch."
2409,Squid Game,"One of the very few TV series which I watched in one go. Fantastic concept, great acting and superb screen play makes it one of the classic TV show of all times."
2410,Squid Game,This was a really predictable and another boring way of showing evil of greed and what things people can do for money. Unnecessary suspense. Wasted my time watching this.
2411,Squid Game,"You get into in at first but then it gets very slow, too many conversations, and it moves so slow you get tired of watching. Fast forwarded half of season. Could've been much better."
2412,Squid Game,Ending is poring. To much bloody and violent.Ending is poring. To much bloody and violent.Ending is poring. To much bloody and violent.Ending is poring. To much bloody and violent.
2413,Squid Game,Really great show. Loved it but found it strange like so many others that the VIP actors are so horrible bad in delivering their lines. It's almost if Tommy Wiseau and the cast from The Room hid behind the VIP masks. Anyway I can live with the bad acting in that episode because everything else is just fantastic.
2414,Squid Game,"If I had not read the 2 books from the 1960' and 1970' by Stephen King, I would have watched the serie with different eyes.But I have read both novels. . So, it's a good serie, that shows what people are willing to do for money. If their life sucks. It shows how the rich people take advantage of the misery of the poor."
2415,Squid Game,"I did not understand the hype. Maybe it's a cultural thing lost in translation. It was poorly dubbed. Dialogue was over acted and juvenile , left me shaking my head. Black mask character must have been related to Kylo Ren. Whole thing over acted. Does anybody remember ""The hunger games""? Ive seen this story before.Gratuitous violence too gimmicky. I wanted to like it but it was just found not plausible. Too many flaws in the small details. It was ok at best. Worth watching but but not worth all the hype and praise. Thats just my opinion."
2416,Squid Game,"This series is just another average one. Nothing less nothing more!And I am explaining:1) NOT original at all. Several movies had as the main idea a game of life and death. Also a recent Japanese series (Alice in borderland) has almost the exact same idea.2) totally predictable even for a six years old.3) Overdramatic without any reason using of course too much of the respective music.4) The acting was almost ridiculous and almost making you laugh instead of feeling what the creator thought you should feel.AND PEOPLE for god sake don't fall for marketing tricks, promotions and trendy stuff.There are so many more (countless) shows and series way much better than this that deserve your time. STOP being sheep and just doing something just because is viral.And i am saying all these after i have watched about 200-300 TV shows and Series and countless movies and not only that trendy ones!Thank you for your attention.(Sorry for my possibly bad English)"
2417,Squid Game,Everything about this was great except for the VIPs. The writing and acting is so atrocious. We could have have done with them speaking at all.
2418,Squid Game,"What about the first 200+ casualities on the first game who didn't know they were going to die if they participate? I think the old man was kind of an ass and wasn't really a chaotic neutral character they tried to portray him to be at the end.Overall, good show."
2419,Squid Game,This serie was mindblowing but the vips actwork was so terrible i cant give it a 10. Thankfully vips were not a major part of the serie.
2420,Squid Game,"I don't see what everyone is going so mad about, just reminded me of things like battle royale but boring. It's as if we live in a world now where just because something is popular everyone loves it, I mean if u genuinely enjoyed it then fair play to u I am happy for you but honestly please don't make more."
2421,Squid Game,The show is great with strong acting from everyone except the VIPs. Gosh!... I don't know if the english actors they get are wannabe actors who live in Korea or what but for all the Korean dramas I've seen the english actors are the worst. The Pakistani actor was top notch. Give him a few more roles in Korea please. The emotion was right there and his limited Korean was realistic for the role.
2422,Squid Game,I give 1 star for the idea. The rest is media hype. Very superficial and easily predictable. You can spend your time better.
2423,Squid Game,"This series is by no means a ""must watch"". All characters except for the main protagonist fall flat. I must say that the acting of Hoyen Jung is not good. All she does is staring grimly into the void.Up until the third game, the series was interesting to watch, if you like the survival/battle royal genre. However, don't expect any unpredictable events. Everything after that just felt trashy with artificial emotions. Even the story around the games, with the cop and the frontman could have been sooo much deeper. Why did the winner of the 2015 games become the frontman? Why was there a bomb introduced? How did the organ trafficking have any impact on the story? Why did noone notice the murals in the sleeping room showed all the games? The list goes on...The worst thing by far was the cringeworthy acting by the VIPs. I have to say, it is actually an achievement to be acting so bad, even though you wear a mask and all you have to do is sit on a couch. I mean, a sixty-nine joke, really? Come on.Any theorycrafting which is done now is because of the bad writing. I can totally understand why the script was rejected before so many times."
2424,Squid Game,"I have to say after watching the trailer, I immediately saved this series to my watch list and could not wait until it is out.However, maybe due to my high expectation I was quite disappointed after finishing the 1st season on one run. Believe me, I'm a sucker for this kind of genre so I'm looking for interesting plot, great games and unpredictable twists. If you're the same as me, the series will not deliver these. I found some parts are redundant with unnecessary overacting, I had to skip plenty times. The plot is quite boring for me compared to other survival-game series. But, I cannot deny the cinematography is great.If you have some time to kill, it still brings you some entertainment. Keep your expectation lower to enjoy it more if possible."
2425,Squid Game,"I liked it , but it was boring sometimes and the actores whose spoke English was bad
It should be more suspense."
2426,Squid Game,"*potential spoilers*There is a lot to like about the early episodes. Good character development, nice pace and some interesting questions about human motivations. Beautiful cinematography and great sound track.Unfortunately towards the end this all unravels and it just boils down to rich men wanting to feel alive and exploiting the poor and desperate to do it. The last episode is a massive disappointment. It could have ended well but chose to be commercial and seek a reason for a sequel.This has certainly been overhyped. If you haven't got to the end yet then watch it through to the penultimate episode and pretend it is the last one. You will be a lot more satisfied."
2427,Squid Game,Squid game is a conventional drama which is dipicted on living experience of human being addicted to capitality. The various games in the drama is showing a testimony that people are living for.People.
2428,Squid Game,"+ brilliant storyline, keeps you gripped until the end
+ great acting from the main actors
+ dubbed in English was fine and easy to follow, subtitles well done too
+ really got attached to the characters, got a bit emotional in parts!left me with a lot of questions at the end of the seriesfound the ending a little frustrating, maybe I didn't understand it?!"
2429,Squid Game,You love characters who are good and you actually hate those who are bad. It's that good. Ignore the VIP!!!!
2430,Squid Game,"Curiosity got me and I started watching it. I found it thoughtful, it gave me another perspective of nowadays society. It's absolutely worth watching it, better than many other series now on Netflix. If you watched ""The Platform"" (Netflix), you will find it amazing for you."
2431,Squid Game,"Didn't we already have hunger games?!? Why do so many dramas have to be filled with violence, yes, that may reflect what's going on in the outside world and that again it is a male dominated series -so I guess another one for the guys and girls who like to look at those guys."
2432,Squid Game,"At some first episodes, I was deeply immersed in the movie and sadly that's all. The main character has nothing but lucky which tried to be a hero but not brave enough. At first the movie focus on games but later just drama and drama which tried to get viewers' tears. What a particular Korean movie!"
2433,Squid Game,"Nice Korean TV show intense, funny and likeable characters."
2434,Squid Game,"Those people at Netflix who thought and approved that promoting this movie is good should at least be ashamed of themselves and maybe put through an experience similar to the ones having in the movie. Just think about this for a sec! Would you have ever heard of this series coming from Korea with the bad acting, the clichee story with the numerous holes, the predictability...etc. Honestly? Never! Only because they create the hype! And they try to sell you a view on humans which is far from real, appealing on your instinctive side and kill all your hopes and wishes. Well, don't fall for this sh't anymore, wake up and see the beauty around you, enjoy this journey whatever it holds for you. Remember that you always have a choice to rise up even if you are at the deepest point of your life."
2435,Squid Game,It's a very good show. The first 6 episodes are the best then it went downhill after that. The English subtitle and the English dub do not match at all. It's better to have English dub without subtitle. Or it is way better to just watch it with the original language with English sub.
2436,Squid Game,This is a well written story. I'm not english and not even korean but the english voice acting is killing me. It's a pain. In my country voice acting is a serious business but this is the cheapest thing i've ever heard. Even the lines are simplified too much.
2437,Squid Game,The show wasreally nice and did not expect the vilan and last episode was unexpectedly awesome.
2438,Squid Game,"Violent, brutal, death and you call this entertainment? Since when did humanity need this in order to have fun watching TV? I am shocked at the number of people claiming this was a great series."
2439,Squid Game,"Squid Game feels like a weird hybrid of Saw and Battle royale franchises with some references to Kubrick's work. Themes and plot twists seem familiar and already seen. It might surprise a novice, but for veterans it offers barely nothing new.You'll understand the title by the end of episode 7. You'll witness maybe the worst English writing and acting of Your life. You have been warned."
2440,Squid Game,"I watched the movie because I heard from my friend this movie was good. When I watched this movie for the first time, I really liked the story line. It makes me curious. I watched episode 1 - 9 in one night."
2441,Squid Game,"I dont understand hype abot this. Pretty average show. Only thing fun are the games, and that is 10% of the show."
2442,Squid Game,"I have now finished squid game (SG). It started off watching episode one that tried to push me away making me not like and understand the protagonist, then it game to the part they were in the game and i was hooked, it was fun, different, and violent. After the first episode i was stoked, i went on watched episode 2 which was terrible. Incredibly boring and trying to build something up to use in the last episode that in the was unecessary. From here on it went downhill.Some police-guy comes in finds out that his brother had the same card as everybody else. Nothing happens with this plotline.SPOILER HERE!!!The old guy, why did he join in it, like i don't need a old man to tell me he started it just to die off. Who is the person that you are going to hunt in season 2? Why not try and build up with some illuminati bull**** as all other series does (would have worked better in SG).The protagonist never had respect for his mother but really wanted in the life of his daughter. Now that the mother is dead it was all he needed to sacrifice his life for the cause to close down squid game?All of these plotholes in the story just shows us that maybe they needed some more people to look at the storyline before it got produced.The acting in the series is often good. I'm not gonna act like i understand a word. But i get the vibe that in some series you can over do the acting and i will work fine. But the acting in the series goes from 0-100 from person to person there is no deeper understanding of what type of acting you are doing, the protagonist in episode 1 overdoes it, in the other epidsodes he is good and relatable and behaves ""normal"". Then you have ""Han Mi-nyeo"" she complete overdoes it, she tries to be a new Hannibal Lecter, but doesn't have the skill to do it in a beliable way.In the end, it doesn't really matter. This review is just not gonna be read because i am on of the 130 something that died in episode 1.I don't hate the series and i'm happy for Korea to be such a big thing on the scene. But damn this is wasted potential.It's not 1/10 it a ""meh out of 10"""
2443,Squid Game,In our present day there is reality shows like survivor looks like the squid game but not killing but I'm surr soon we will see the real squid game in our live.The serie is very good and attractive. I like it.
2444,Squid Game,"The show is so bland! I don't even know where to start. The acting is bad, and the characters do not make sense at the time. There is no depth whatsoever, there is nothing between the lines and the story doesn't add up. I really hope the rating would fall below 7/10 since this doesn't make any sense."
2445,Squid Game,Awesome show couldn't stop watching it. The way everyone gets scared loves the lady and the gangster always arguing. Sad part when the marbles were replaced with stones.
2446,Squid Game,"I am absolutely blown away by this show - thankfully not in the red light, green light sense. I wish I could wipe it from my mind just to experience it all over again.The writing is impeccable from start to finish, the characters, the pace, the TENSION that the writers create make for a rollercoaster viewing. I screamed, I cried, I cringed, I covered my face but still watched through my hands because honestly you can not look away while watching this show. It is so clever yet so simplistic in it's storytelling. You will adore some characters and sympathise with some of the darker characters once you learn more about them.I cannot fault it. Even the VIPs that everyone is talking about did not take away from the action for me. They were vile but the stakes in the episode are so high you won't really care.Honestly I haven't been this enthralled and excited about a show since I was a teenager going to watch Catching Fire in the cinema.If gory things aren't your cup of tea then be warned, but I wouldn't miss out on this show because of that."
2447,Squid Game,"It's the twist no one wanted. But I still thought it was a very interesting season. I watched most of it on planes and would not recommend that, I felt bad for the passengers all around me."
2448,Squid Game,"After the 1st episode you can skip minutes or even episodes yet get the whole idea of the series.. Its a big fault! You can guess the end..
Another way i judge that amount of depth and complexity at the end is to low..."
2449,Squid Game,"This was a disappointment, coming with high hopes from all the buzz about it and previous experience with Korean drama with greats like Parasite...
The ideas are great and promising, yet the bad script brought it really down, the script describes everything and doesn't really leave room for you to figure it out on your own; as well as being full of badly written cliches. I don't mind a cliche but at least make an effort to not make it seem like one.The newly introduced characters in episode 7 were the most atrocious addition, their acting and lines were beyond horrible that I thought I was watching a high school production.An overall meh..."
2450,Squid Game,"The VIP's were, as many said before, horrible actors."
2451,Squid Game,Don't know if there will be a second season. The end for the first one does not have the same value as the rest of the series.
2452,Squid Game,"The show started off strongly, made me bingewatch up to the end of the games. From there onwards, it seemed like the loose ends were just patched together to make sense before the show wrapped up - the tying together of the families of the lost ones, player001's whole mystery... Won't even mention the forced acting of the VIPs and lack of purpose and engagement with the main plot. Apart from the games which kept you on the edge, the side plots were rather weak and dragging."
2453,Squid Game,All the tv makers should benchmark their creativity with this. We are hungry for new out of the box script with good acting.
2454,Squid Game,"This series hooked me in fast. My husband and I binged the series in two days. It showed the dark side of human desperation all while somehow being relatable regardless of your status in this world. Everyone makes it a point to mention the VIP's, which yes the acting was poor, but it didn't tarnish the rest of the show. I won't say too much more other than the fact I'm pissed I cried the way I did over that old man lmao bamboozled."
2455,Squid Game,Acting style might not be for everyone but the story and tension just delivers awesomely.Also the character's backgrounds are very well introduced and furthermore some twists are served.
2456,Squid Game,Awesome and I like you. Best Series I have been right now.
2457,Squid Game,"Terrible acting, terrible scenario. I couldn't finish the first episode. Simply waste of money and time."
2458,Squid Game,Simply i enjoyed every single minute in the magnificent series.
2459,Squid Game,"This series is gripping and enjoyable, the story is compelling and the characters envoke emotional connections be them positive or negative. The only real failing is the atrocious voice acting, they are extremely poor, unbelievable and cartoon like for many of the characters."
2460,Squid Game,"Loved the first few episodes. I slept late on a working night just to watch it in a single go.The plotholes though were definitely trying to sink this Titanic in the end.1. The Cop story -
I can't digest that he could so easily swoop the whole facility and got caught on a distant island instead.The morse code thing, what was is about?He had sent proofs about the games to the police via his super long-lasting iphone but still nobody does anything for an year?So basically his character development goes in vain. Gets killed by his own brother and couldn't do anything about the game.2. At the end, the three finalists had been given one knife each. What if 2 people would have got killed? If yes, there would have been a winner without even playing the last game. What's the point of such scheduling, planning and discipline. It doesn't make sense.3. The glass shattering scene at the end of the game was totally unnecessary and senseless. What if they killed all their participants unknowingly? There would be no games at all, no winner?4. VIPs were totally unnecessary. They didn't even show their betting properly. After all, at the end it turns it was all for fun but we never saw that enthusiastic gambling from the vips.There are more but I guess I can remember this much only as of now."
2461,Squid Game,"Thank god for the 15 second skip button, I found this show utterly predictable, the over acting is atrocious, I love Asian Kung fu films this is just terrible acting, the only part I didn't pick was 001, I'll never watch another Korean film again."
2462,Squid Game,"The show was OK, but the storyline about the detective was just too much. I mean, He just happened to be passing by when the main character was reporting the games to the police. He was JUST following the main character the day he returned to the games. He curiously had a disappeared brother that won a few games before this one. He should have been caught like a thousand times for being sloppy. And finally the brother being the leader was just ridiculous."
2463,Squid Game,"Spoiler alert.The American guests were the most annoying part of the show imo. They were like the ultimate parody of ""americans"" and it was a litlle cringe tbh (and I'm not even American). Besides that great unique show."
2464,Squid Game,"One of the best korean show i had ever seen,i hope there' second season of it , love it.."
2465,Squid Game,Real suspense thriller. Great show. Exciting from start to finish. An international hit. Perhaps a season 2 ??? Would be awesome. South Korea has produced a tremendous television show.
2466,Squid Game,"This show was truly one-of-a-kind. I adore everything about it. One of my current favourite series, and I'm looking forward to the second season."
2467,Squid Game,"My kids on my back to watch it, so watched first episode, bit over the top for me and didn't think much of the first episode, but then watched the second and I got hooked, watched the whole series, this not perfect but bloody close, it got me in and I enjoyed the first season allot so much I'm watching it again. I can see why it is so popular and now I have to wait for second season. Really worth watching but warning allot of blood and gore."
2468,Squid Game,"The first half-hour of Netflix's new top-ranked show, Squid Game, introduces Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a middle-aged gambler so down on his luck that he steals money from his elderly mom and gives his young daughter a gun-shaped cigarette lighter for her birthday, because it was the only thing he could get out of the claw machine where he inserted his last coins. After meeting a well-dressed recruiter in a train station, Gi-hun agrees to a money-making opportunity. He gets in a van, is knocked out by gas, and wakes up in a dorm with more than 400 others. A voice from a loudspeaker tells them that they will compete for a lot of cash-how much, they don't find out quite yet, but it turns out to be 45.6 billion South Korean won, or about 38 million American dollars-by playing children's games.Here starts the bloody part. The group is herded into another huge room, painted incongruously with a bright preschool color scheme, to play a game of Red Light, Green Light. They find out quickly that the price of remaining in motion after the creepy pigtailed robot in charge says ""Red Light!"" isn't just disqualification-it's a bullet. Before the end of the game, about half of the participants are straight-up murdered. This is not a show for viewers who dislike seeing people shot at close range (or stabbed, or killed by falling from a height, and so on). There are literally hundreds of such deaths in the show's nine episodes, with a bonus dissection scene, if what you really crave is to see some intestines. And almost everybody on the show is afraid, all the time-the actors are constantly trembling, crying, and shaking, under the most extreme forms of duress.If you can stand all that, you should watch this show. In some ways, Squid Game, directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, is another familiar entry in the ""Deadly Game"" genre. It's like the movie Cube (1997), in that the players wear jumpsuits that strip them of their individuality, are trapped in a hermetic environment that looks computer-generated, and try to solve puzzles before they're horribly murdered-but in Squid Game the staff running the game are visible, and there are many more contestants. It's like Battle Royale (2000), though the players are adults, not teenagers. It's like The Hunger Games, though the larger society outside the game is not a fictionalized dystopia, like Suzanne Collins' Panem, just everyday South Korea. It's like the movie Gamer (2009), though the players are not controlled from afar by rich people who want to experience peril without personal risk-they're just watched, up close, by rich people who want to experience peril without personal risk.Squid Game is different from its genre cousins in one major way, and it's the one that gives the show its emotional punch. The players must decide that they want to be part of the game. After the opening massacre, the group takes advantage of a clause in the contract they signed, and votes, by simple majority, to end the game and go home, without anyone getting the money. They are home for a short while, before they all end up back in the van, submitting to the sleeping gas, on the way back to try for the prize.They are simply too desperate-indebted, like Gi-hun; refugees, like Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon, a mesmerizing presence on screen, and a fan favorite), a defector who needs money to bring her family from North Korea; undocumented immigrants, like Abdul Ali (Tripathi Anupam), a big-hearted Pakistani father whose employer is stealing his wages. They would rather try for a big payoff, see a lot of people die, and possibly die themselves, than waste away slowly in the real world, trying to achieve something that seems impossible.They're not all ""good"" people. The primary villain among the players, Jang Deok-su (Heo Sung-tae), is a gangster who owes money to other gangsters. Deok-su is comically evil, resorting to outright murder of fellow players when he realizes that every death gets him closer to the prize money and that the staff will do nothing if he kills outside of the context of the games. And there's another villain, whose identity I won't spoil, who does something unforgivable to a fellow player that will absolutely break your heart. The fate of the more sympathetic characters among them is where the drama lies.The ins and outs of the games are thrilling. When the team of scrappy protagonists-male and female, young and old-tugs and tugs at a rope, trying to drag a much stronger, all-male team over a precipice, I cheered for every step back they took, even though them winning would mean a bunch of other people would get crushed to death. When Ji-yeong (Lee Yoo-mi), a woman who killed her abusive father and has just left prison with no money or friends to her name, sacrifices herself for Sae-byeok, I wept. When the contestants get to the eponymous Squid Game-a contest of offense and defense, so named because the grid that kids play it on is drawn to look like a squid-the drama had me looking at my phone to escape the tension. That's what watching a good game will do to you.Yes, I know, there's some irony in the fact that a show that's partly a moral commentary on the evils of spectatorship is No. 1 on Netflix. Few people are immune to the draw of watching others play hard and crafty, when the stakes are high. But, as the snippet of news about rising rates of household indebtedness in South Korea that plays in a hair salon in the last episode makes clear, the other big idea of the show is financial desperation, and what it does to people when they get on the wrong side of a bad system. As Gi-hun, who turns out to have a much richer backstory than I'd thought, says defiantly at one point: ""I'm not a horse. I'm a person."" I can't wait for Season 2, to find out how they play it."
2469,Squid Game,"But the VIPs were CRINGE!Great acting, great story, great twists!"
2470,Squid Game,"I really really enjoyed this. The acting from the Korean actors was incredible, all of them were brilliant and so believable. All the interactions between the players in the early games were so great, especially Gi-Hun, Ming-Wae and Sang-Woo. Yes the English actors were crap but it didn't really detract from it, if anything it made them more creepy and added to the atmosphere that they saw themselves as Gods.Don't want to spoil it but honestly it's so worth a watch. As awful as it is, it highlights the terrible things that possibly happen in the world."
2471,Squid Game,"It's just like a mix of trending Netflix shows. To be honest I didn't find any original on this. I recommend you to watch Alice in Borderline, it's so much better than this overrated show."
2472,Squid Game,Good series. Making up some words so this review is posted ok then here qe go ill try now.Making up some words so this review is posted ok then here qe go ill try now.
2473,Squid Game,"This is everything you want from a TV-Series. Drama, Thriller, Entertainment, good acting for a TV series and of course very good storyline.The Koreans never seem to disappoint when it comes to Drama/Thrillers. There's always something you don't expect that happens at some time in the movie/series that you just are left speechless.If Wes Anderson would have made a Thriller Tv Series, I think it would've pretty much looked like this one, haha. I liked the cameras, the scenes where it looks like an animation movie (e.g. The stairs), and most of all the symmetry.The actors who play the VIPs are extremely bad at acting. I mean, what the hell? A show this great, ruined by only 4-5 bad secondary actors.All in all, I would give 9 out of 10 to this amazing production. Would recommend to anyone."
2474,Squid Game,"I don't know why the show gets so much praise internationally. I mean overall it's a really bingeable show, but there's really nothing much aside from that. In my country, the show receives so many polarized comments, with people either loving it badly or hating it with passion.The game master said that the game is created so that those mistreated in the outside world will be treated equally in the game, and yet the master himself did not get shot when he lost the game (voluntarily or not). In the ""walking on glass"" game, when one candidate knew how to tell tempered glass from normal glass, the front man turned off all the lights just to make the game more entertaining to the VIPs, effectively rendering the poor man unable to use his skills. I guess it's still much advantageous to be rich and powerful even in the so-called equal game, hah?The main character is horrible. He's a loser with no character development throughout the movie. He's described as a person that has so much compassion and empathy with others, yet in the end he didn't even bother visiting his daughter in the US - all because of some nonsense triggering comments from the front man. And gosh he wouldn't even have kept his promise to the North Korean defecting girl to take care of her brother had it not been for the call from the organizer. Such a f*cked-up man who I have no sympathy for.There are so many other flaws in the movie that I don't have time to bother mentioning. All in all, a movie with good intentions and palatable cinematography, but horrendous execution. If you like death-game shows, better watch Alice in Borderland, Jinrou Game, the Incite Mill, Liar Game, or many that actually make you use your brain to figure out how to escape your ill-fated situation and don't annoy you with hypocritical mouthings."
2475,Squid Game,"Dont know where to start, I simply cant understand the hype concerning this Show. Okay, sometimes emotions hast been awaken, but compared ro nearly wvwry other serie, this was just annoying, boring and really bad actors."
2476,Squid Game,"The show is fun to watch and serves its purpose, entertain you.As for the plot there are several wholes and mistakes, and even things that do not get anywhere. But it's interesting and the character development is good.Now the worst part, the VIPs. Worst actors ever. Poorly executed and maybe poorly written? I can't imagine directing and seeing that performance and allowing it to make the cut."
2477,Squid Game,"Squid game is an excellent show that piques your interest from the get-go. They slowly build up the story and once you understand what happens with the people who lose the game; you're hooked.If you have the eye of a detective (like me), then you'll know from the first game that the old man is involved in some way and is not just a player.The 4th game has a lot of twists and is a rollercoaster of emotions. This episode will make even the toughest people cry.I definitely recommend this show."
2478,Squid Game,"I watched the series in german sync. I cannot understand the bad reviews about the VIPs. In the german sync version they speak english to underline the international connection to the ""Squid game"". Of course some of them are not native speakers and the fact, that they all wear masks makes it even harder to act, but keep in mind that this is a korean production and the budget was definitely litmited for these charakters."
2479,Squid Game,"I would highly recommend to someone looking for something to watch, if they take it in the spirit intended.Squid Game was a show that I unavoidably watched late. The hype and everyone talking about it (either loving or hating it) meant I just had to give it a go. I had a feeling I would be disappointed and left with a forgettable drama which draws its viewers from its bizarreness.I couldn't have been more wrong. I found the story to be, besides a few stretches, reasonably grounded in reality. The focus for me was the characters, which were well written and well acted. The story gripped me and I thought the games themselves were tense and kept me hooked. I thought it remained consistent throughout and finished off with a strong ending that does justice to the series. Overall, I was really impressed with all aspects of it, and is something I'd more than happily watch again and I'm glad I watched it.One last point i'll put is I watched it with subtitles, if you can read I don't understand why anyone would pick otherwise. It adds to the authenticity and viewing experience.In conclusion, good story, good acting and good show all around;9/10."
2480,Squid Game,This is honestly the best series i have ever watched i finished it in one night and now i cant stop thinking about it everything about it is perfect the storyline the events are not exepcted a lot of plot twists i have every single emotion watching this stress anxiety anger happy and i mean it i will never regret watching it good job.
2481,Squid Game,"Good show starts strong but last two episodes are a struggle to get through. The story is great both in the game and the underlying meanings of society but at some points incredibly slow and very, very predictable throughout. Main character shines."
2482,Squid Game,So fas so good but please Netflix there is no need to season 2 you will ruined it.
2483,Squid Game,IT IS VERY BIG AND IS FROM KOREA.... FANTASTIC.... ONE BIG BANG AT YOUR STOMACH...
2484,Squid Game,"I really didn't expect that much when I started to watch this serie. I finaly binged it and loved it. Got sticked in front of the screen. I really liked the scenario and the acting. A very surprising serie that I suggest you to watch. Be aware however, this is brutal visualy and emotionaly."
2485,Squid Game,"Criticize the VIPs all you want, but don't ding the show for the VIP's bad acting, poor scripts, and being terribly out of place altogether. I believe all of that is intentional. We, as viewers of the show, are just like the VIPs. We are paying for our Netflix subscriptions to fund the show's production, and watching this ""game"" fold out for our entertainment. It's no wonder these VIPs purposefully speak English.If you're disgusted by the VIPs (and hopefully most of us are), then you should be disgusted by ourselves and our roles in society."
2486,Squid Game,"It is hard to explain my thought without spoilers but I have to do this, cause rating of Squid Game is so good. You won't see any drama in here. Main characters will do things just because the script writer wanted to do so but you won't understand motivation of them. Especially motivation of main hero. Director, operators, editors, costume guys and other people involved in Squid Game production did a pretty good job but script writer ruined everything. Watch this ably as pop-corn movie because there's no character design in it, no interesting twists, no drama - nothing."
2487,Squid Game,"I was so enthusiastic about this show since the whole world went crazy about it, and memes everywhere around. I think the idea and production are great, but overall execution was so bad, it was almost painful to finish it. I generally love stuff that comes from Korea, this is the first one that was disappointing."
2488,Squid Game,There is no need to spend time on such a predictable series.
2489,Squid Game,"I think the general idea and scenario were really good. The characters and actors had done great work but I think there was too much violence and blood in the episodes.Besides that, there were some unrealistic events during the episodes like for example:
when the policeman went to the island hiding under the van. Like common how's that even possible?! Which part under the car he was holding to it ?!please tell me also how did the phone Battery hold for more than 5 days ?!And there are more and more of that unrealistic events.In general, it's was a great serious and it deserves watching but the blood, violence and the unrealistic events might ruin it a little bit."
2490,Squid Game,"A really good series its only need better writing, think carefully about the quotes, for the next season it will be epic if it was in Spain with Spanish actors."
2491,Squid Game,"Humans vs humans is a no brainer for writers. Be it Hunger Games, 13, The Hunt, or Surviving the Game, I as well as others, for what ever reason, are going to watch...in spite of the quality.My first concern was the acting, not the actors ability, but them acting like Koreans. Are Koreans usually this giddy and overly reactive in certain situations? The main character at the horserace or with his daughter was uncomfortable to watch, but it could be it didnt translate well. As for the VIP, a lot of criticism has been on their acting, but does it matter since the Korean version would have translated there words for them? If so, they could have been spouting gibberish and the subtitles for the Korean audience would have remedied that easily.As with the aforementioned films, this one lacks a punch ending. Writers just dont seem to find a ending that is as strong as the beginning. The last game had none of the emotional power and cleverness of the prior ones. The 5th left something to be desired also, except to resolve an issue between two characters.I suffered through all of my criticisms, and you should as well. It is just such a strong idea, wish someone could deliver an ending."
2492,Squid Game,Would give it 10 if it ended with an ending.Please don't ruin this with a second season.
2493,Squid Game,"I don't know why people hype this up so much. Story is boring and predictable.The VIPs were bad actors, and the other characters were mostly annoying.As said in my first sentence I can't seem to understand why people like this so much and that it is rated an 8.3.."
2494,Squid Game,"Very good. Worth watching, can't wait for season 2."
2495,Squid Game,"Dub was good. Awesome show, give it a watch it was a lot of fun."
2496,Squid Game,There is no need for an actual review. Just watch this piece of art.
2497,Squid Game,"Strong start that set up false expectations. Elements from.survival game movies, Star wars, Hostel, etc thrown together. Flat characters and dialogue. Overdramatized, drawn out, increasingly predictable scenes. Episodes in descending order of creativity. Stilted emotions as if the audience is shown cue cards to feel sympathy or sadness. There are a few interesting moments to warrant a few stars. In other words, a Netflix production."
2498,Squid Game,"Plot, visuals, acts, scale... every elements were so well prepared and harmonized. The characters have distinct personalities and are very interesting.According to the characteristics of each stage of the survival game, the appearances of the characters collide and gather whenever they encounter in extreme situations. All those factors fit each other amazingly well. Each character also represents an aspect of society issue or shape of human beings.This movie is not only giving you entertainment, but also throw questions about matter of humanity, morals, strategy, social issues, family and the weight of life & death.There is no scene to skip."
2499,Squid Game,I thought this tv show is very overrated!! Main story is nothing new and interested. I'm very disappointed in korean tv show. Since episode 1 is very boring.
2500,Squid Game,"Very slow, I expected it to catch me from chapter one and in the middle I stopped it to finish it another day. The idea is not bad but in general it is not what I expected."
2501,Squid Game,"It's not worth watching it. It was weird in the beginning, then it gets too predictable, it's definitely not that brutal and that good. The actors on the other side are very good, admirations. We only watched the whole series so we can understand the memes about it."
2502,Squid Game,"Everything becomes boring after a point""The goal is not to make lot of money but after making lots n lots is not to get bore while enjoying the material thingsWhat a series man The bestest series everI so wanted Sae byeok to win the prize money."
2503,Squid Game,Unbelievably good. A must watch. One of the best things to come out of Netflix.
2504,Squid Game,I was talking to Cahir about it lastnight. Concept is decent and can see why it's popular but the dialog in the show is so stupid! It's like they're forcing lines to cover up the Korean lip sync.
2505,Squid Game,"I really wish at the end, the frontman was just Mr Beast. Seems like something he would do just to mix it up a bit.All seriousness aside, this is a real thrill ride with some absolutely brutal moments and really shows the lengths people go to stay alive. Greed, guilt, remorse, relief and anger are just a handful of the emotions shown by the cast.Very thought provoking and would highly recommend to anyone."
2506,Squid Game,"Despite its many, many flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed this.Needs a lot of fine tuning, every so often I'd spot something that would need polishing; an editing choice would seem amateurish or a shot composition would feel flat. A lot of the characters make some questionable decisions that go beyond the realm of reason.The biggest issue by a long shot is the VIP characters. Awful dialogue, awful performances. In Bong Joon-ho's The Host, the American characters give similarly poor performances so maybe it's just a translation thing. Maybe it works both ways, and Korean people think that Korean speaking roles in English movies are bad too?The set design is insane. They kinda went above and beyond with this aspect because each set was immensely detailed, and yet they never felt fake.I liked how all the characters were written (except the VIPs). Each one had a distinctive trait that allowed them to stand out. Players 456, 067 and 199 were the easiest to sympathise with, since they were victims of circumstance. Player 218 has some unexpected growth that adds an interesting dynamic to the story. I liked the relationship between 101 and 212, it was like they were both bloodsucking parasites that had latched themselves onto each other.With such compelling characters, the story is elevated even more when the games enforce the idea that death is very real possibility for them. Features plenty of nerve-wracking moments. The 4th game is by far my favourite, as soon as they explained the rules, I was wrought with anxiety. Blue Danube was used to signify the beginning of a new game, so I was Pavlovian conditioned into associating the song with a sense of dread.I feel like the Dystopian Death Sport story is a concept that has never reached its fullest potential, but this is probably the best the subgenre has to offer. By no means a perfect series, but it has interesting characters, unique death-games and doesn't shy away from violence. This is probably the most exciting watch I've had this year."
2507,Squid Game,"Started out abit weird but thats just me being an
European not so used to Asian movies/series.How ever, could not stop watching and binge watched the series :pOnly complaint is in the final episodes where some new characters enter the series and the use of these actors or how they make them act, is just sad.... They don't feel authentic at all and i really mean NOT AT ALL.Better actors for this last group or better use of the actors they had, would have given this series a 9/10 instead of 7/10.Still worth the watch tho =)"
2508,Squid Game,"It's rare I get into tv shows but gave this a try as a lot of people had recommended it. It's absolutely superb, gripping from start to finish."
2509,Squid Game,"I find the logic/reason behind the death games is very weak. Otherwise the thrills, exitment, acting desighn all are quete good. But for the ending and the logic i give the rating 6 in overall. If their a strong logic behind this games i wpuld give it to 9."
2510,Squid Game,"I found it pretty sleepy. Even had to go back and rewatch a few episodes due to having fallen asleep.I felt there was nothing all that new in it, knew who would win from the start (well duh!), And generally I thought the acting was pretty bad for the most part.Hype is hype... And this was hype."
2511,Squid Game,"Before 4th game there are 39 players. The madwoman can't find anyone to play with and they stay to play 38.They are divided into pairs and so there are 19 dead and 19 comeback and continue in game 5.Then those 19+ crazy woman witch is waiting for them, they had to be 20, not 17 as they showed is episode 7 at the beginning.3 players are lost !!!?"
2512,Squid Game,"Finally Netflix has created a masterpiece. No doubt about that. If you are a lover of the purge series,and can withstand a bit of violence and blood,mixed with human emotions and hard truths,this series is tailor made for you. You wont be able to stop after watching the first episode,you can bet on that. Excellent thriller!"
2513,Squid Game,"It's the worst show I have seen till date on Netflix. I don't know why the hype around is so much it's just garbage. No reason or clue , characters are repeating the same dialogue in a different way twice !! Don't watch it if u want to save 9 hrs of your life , I have wasted mine don't waste yours."
2514,Squid Game,"As a Korean-American who is a fan of cinema, Korean film and television still has a long way to go overall. There are a few standout directors (Bong Joon Ho and. Park Chan Wook immediately come to mind), but in general-as demonstrated in Squid Game-Korean cinema is prone to over-dramatization, reducing character to two dimensional caricatures, very obvious and amateur plot holes among other glaring faults that take away from the effect and value of the film. The plot is engaging to be sure, but the execution prevents me from feeling fully invested in the emotional turmoil of the characters.Decent series overall but not at all deserving of whatever hype it's received."
2515,Squid Game,"I never reviewed a movei or show before on IMDB, but this show made me wanna do it, because its this show is just beautifull, the actors are sooo great at acting, the show is just a perfection
go and watch it goddammit."
2516,Squid Game,Was expecting a typical graphic Korean movie... Turned out the movie was engaging with a nice twist to the ending. Highly recommended!
2517,Squid Game,"Like other BR related movie/series, it's not so different from them, just some extra plots to build the emotions to attract audiences, but overall was moderate."
2518,Squid Game,Too slow for my taste. 4 episodes would have been enough. I guess it is a cultural thing. Will there be a European version or an American? Or maybe a new Korean version?
2519,Squid Game,"The show's moral is ""the poor and rich are similar"". The poor being the good guys and the rich being the bad guys. As reasonable as the trope is, this one is executed terribly. Let's call is this a ""Game of Thrones"" ending: I was enthralled until the 7th episode and then it was garbage."
2520,Squid Game,"The series definitely has its pros and cons. They have an interesting story, but it is not completely credible. I was definitely expecting an explanation for why the game was made and I got it, but it was pretty lukewarm and not convincing. Some of the characters are also quite poorly portrayed and processed. The acting at times seemed artificial to me. The series it is not bad, but it is definitely a overrated."
2521,Squid Game,"I never watched a Korean series but I loved this one. It was original, surprising and suspenseful. Just get through the first episode and you'll be hooked."
2522,Squid Game,"Yes, Westworld. Really. Westworld? Yes, that American show. Westworld. Yes, Westworld!? !!? It started like a Western? Yes. Then kinda got like The Matrix? Yes. Sort of. Ah, WESTWORLD!!!!!ButBetter."
2523,Squid Game,"The thing I love about this series is the game was designed or held by a normal people. That what makes the games has flaws, so when some of the contestants cheated, it makes sense for the pink guard didn't noticed since they're also normal people."
2524,Squid Game,"I was forced into watching this by my family. If you've seen Saw and Hunger Games, you can skip this show. It's nowhere near as good.Many of the characters are worse than annoying. The only two tolerable players are the old man, and the man from Pakistan.There doesn't seem to be a point to the game. It demoralizes the players, all of whom are pretty demoralized to begin with anyway.I would never recommend anyone watching this unless you have read every book you own, and watched all other movies and shows you wanted to watch first.If they make a sequel I will not be watching. I do not care what happens beyond this travesty."
2525,Squid Game,"Really nice idea, but I think it would've worked better as a movie. Maybe even a movie series? Even in 9 episodes I didn't get that bond with the characters, so I would've just leave some out. I think there was a lot of unnecessary scenes for such a short season. I didn't really see the policeman finding his brother very necessary for example. The old man was really a key for this one, he really saved the whole series at the end. All in all this movie still gets 6/10 because of the great casting, visuals, set and the idea."
2526,Squid Game,"The show has a lot going for it, most of is positive until the VIPs come in to play. Their acting and script are horrible. To me, they came across as Skyrim NPCs. Apart from this the series is super solid and one of the best to watch at the moment. Great work!"
2527,Squid Game,"The acting of all characters for me is the core of the movie. They spent so much effort in props and decor... Really nice and yeah the games are exiting to watch but the ridiculous way of acting is so painful. Why is there only a list wich camera you may use to maintain the quality??? ""You're tearing me apart Lisa!!!"""
2528,Squid Game,I don't have a lot to say about it.. Acting 1/10 and story 2/10. So overrated series. Not really good actors and slow movie. I was waiting to see if it was going to be some twist but the way they directed this series was so wrong.
2529,Squid Game,"Great Korean actors, the main ones performance impeccable. Couldn't stop watching. Watched the nine hours series in one weekend. Yeah the VIP performance sucks but i guess they have stored it for the next seasons. Korean horror movies, train to busan, parasite, squid game rocks!"
2530,Squid Game,I'm going to keep this short but this show was going amazing right up until the vip episode where it began to crumble to pieces. The plot and the high school theater level acting of the vips made me want to turn off the episode. I still don't think that was worse than the last episode though the ending was way too predictable and I hated what they did with the old man. Overall a good show but they definitely could've wrapped it up better.
2531,Squid Game,One of the best asian series. The subject is interesting but i cannot see a good continuity.
2532,Squid Game,"The premise sounds cool at first but when you get into the show first thing you realize is how unoriginal and dull it really is. I was basically done with the show after the staff member dropped his gun for some reason to finish off the doctor with his knife up-close and he got shot last second by the 10 man fire-squad that entered the room making no noise whatsoever, which has one entrance, that neither of the people in the room noticed. You will notice all kinds of things like these if you watch movies and shows regularly. They could at least try to make the deaths interesting but not gonna happen in a Netflix show i suppose. It's the good old bullet to the head or fall of from some high ground in any of the games and nothing else.The characters don't act like real people do, why would that girl sacrifice herself for the other girl she met a day ago, why would the head of the game not make his goons search his room after he realises the intruder is literally in his room, instead of going after him by himself while announcing he knows the intruder in his room...I wouldn't recommend watching this show unless you have time to kill and you don't really care what you are watching is good or not. I really felt like I wasted my time by the end of the show."
2533,Squid Game,Do yourself a big favor and listen to the Korean audio with subtitles. The voice over dialog does t do the show any justice. Very enjoyable. Has a Parasite meet Maze Runner type of feel.
2534,Squid Game,"Slow at times, but intense and engaging throughout. Acting was on point and I loved how they mixed different elements of society and human behavior.The only issue was the VIPs. Quite the buzz kill in terms of acting and overall performance. They didn't fit in there they way they should. Casting failGive it a watch peeps!"
2535,Squid Game,"Interesting premise. Characters are flawed however they are not people you would get behind. I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy who just stole from his elderly mother to gamble? And feel bad for him when he is mugged?Also watching in English with subtitles. The dubbed voices are laughable. Netflix should've put an usher behind the voice actors for the English Dub.Not as gory as everyone is saying it is. And not many characters to get behind. It's well shot and the acting is good however the story and characters make it generic like things before it Saw, Escape room, Hostel etc."
2536,Squid Game,"Firstly, I want to address the VIP criticism. I honestly hated the VIPs too, but considering how breathtakingly good the acting was by EVERYONE involved, I think their over the top, cringe inducing acting was purposeful. You're SUPPOSED to loathe them, and they are meant to be insufferable and cold.With that out of the way, without spoiling anything, I think that the intentionality behind every shot, every line, and the beautiful sets was unfathomably great. I felt every emotion along this ride of a show and have never ""ugly cried"" during any movie or show in my life like I did with Squid Game. In my opinion, this is the best show or movie I have ever seen and I've been recommending it to everyone. This is the first review I've ever submitted to IMDB; I went out of my way to write it because I was so moved by this series.I'm hoping for another season and am dying to learn more about so many things going on at the end. Luckily, the rewatchability of this show is of the highest degree due to the many Easter eggs and intentionally placed foreshadowing throughout. This show deserves every bit of recognition it's received and then some. If you're on the fence about watching this show, WATCH IT!"
2537,Squid Game,"This series is highly overrated. The acting is amateur like, too much drama, drags for way too long, and the story has many plot holes that are difficult to overlook. I don't understand how this series got so popular... I understand that a lot may be lost in translation but really this is a cheap try to make something that keeps you hooked but has no substance at all."
2538,Squid Game,"This series really does not add anything new for us who've seen it all. Yes, it's addictive, but a disappointing end of the season, and while I can imagine how the next and hopefully final season is going to look like, I'm not going to invest more time in it.I don't know about how the Korean script is like, but the American parts is below par.If you've watched the movies I've listed in the title, don't bother to watch this series."
2539,Squid Game,"..and bad acting 😫 never have i seen a serie as bad as this one.. like i sad: ridiculous!I dont know why people are so exsided, its a really stupid story.."
2540,Squid Game,"The ending disappointed me when it was revealed that the old man was the mastermind of the games. Other than that, the show was riveting and addicting."
2541,Squid Game,"The show started good gor the couole of episodes but began to downgrade at the endings. The VIPs were awfully bad and full of cringe dialogue of 9 year olds. As for the main lead actor of the show, he was not good in any aspect. The Pakistani guy was more likable than him. Except for one episode I don't think there is any scene in which the main lead actor is useful."
2542,Squid Game,"Great plot, great acting, and all around great show. One of the best series I've seen on netflix in a very long time. Korean cinema is absolutely the best with their story telling. 10/10!!"
2543,Squid Game,That was mind blowing Xtreme performances blow my head love it. I think this is the new beginning of great xtreme show. Waiting for next seasons. Hats off🙏🙏🙏
2544,Squid Game,The worst series I have ever watched. Very naive action and desperate acting.
2545,Squid Game,"Since I've recently finished the current season of the show, i thought I'd share my views here. I'd like to start off by saying that the show started off on a good note. I started watching it like pretty much everyone else, it created a lot of buzz on the Internet, so I thought it must be worth checking out. The concept of the show was itself good and for the most part, well executed. It took me back, since when I first started watching the show, I didn't know what to expect. I felt like the show did generally well with the character development and the plot, despite the little time it had. My primary criticism is aimed towards the aftermath from episode 6 of the show. The show was really a hell of a rollercoaster ride till that point. Like many others, I also disliked the portrayal of the VIPs. Their portrayal was more of an annoyance and a disturbance than anything else. They had weird accents and pronunciation, cheesy lines and way of talking. They served more to distract than add something to the plot. The final boss fight between Gi-hun and Sang-woo could also have been performed better. Sang-woo went down too easily. The detective's (presuming he survived) and his brother's storylines were left on a cliffhanger. Then the ending is the current and trending problem of the show. It left too many unanswered questions and it'd be disappointing for the show to end on such a note. If there are plans for a 2nd season, then it will have a lot of explaining to do: the organization, how Gi-hun was able to stay under the radar despite being filthy rich, the role of In-ho and etc."
2546,Squid Game,It's simply one of the best thriller series I've ever seen. I'm starting to dig in the Korean TV series to find sth similar.
2547,Squid Game,"I personally don't like this type of shows, where people get locked in something , and they all die except one person. But, i liked it here because this time, it was different. It showed exactly why those people are in there, and i really like the choice they gave them, so everybody was in there because of their own will. They really did awesome description of every single main character, and why they choose to play the game. That is what kept me into the series, and why it is different from all the other shows like that.BUT, after episode 6, everything went downside in my opinion... Ending is just horrible, it has no meaning to why they did all of this ( i mean, that plot twist at the end was nothing special ), but fun... Common really.. . I feel like it is not that well described, it was fast explained , and put into half of episode, done really fast... That is just my opinion, otherwise great show , coming from person who does not like this types of show at all !"
2548,Squid Game,I just wish that they could find voice actors doing the English Audio that don't sound so dorky and that have some sort of acting training. The show was great and the idea was spectacular but the voice actors really made it hard to wanna keep watching. It's like they were trying to sound cheesy and Netflix was totally okay with that.
2549,Squid Game,"Just watch it
I watch a million TV shows & movies
And I shoud say this is one of my best experiences."
2550,Squid Game,"The voice actors are incredibly cringe in this show, it wasn't until episode 4 where I discovered I could change the audio to Korean within the Netflix settings. Makes it so much better."
2551,Squid Game,One of the best making and a simple storyline but the message of human kind behaviour makes the story more interesting.
2552,Squid Game,"The plot is great, the acting is superb & the soundtrack is very neatly placed! Squid Game manages to shock, excite & pull your heart strings right from the get go. A must watch if you're up for some good time & aren't easily disturbed by some gore."
2553,Squid Game,"Disturbing, graphic and full of suspense. Worth a watch, quite a few twists and turns. The ending was not at all what I expected, and it did keep me on the edge of my seat throughout.Dubbed in English, and it came across really well."
2554,Squid Game,"All the hype on social media made me sit and watch the serie - and yes, I expected something really gooood!I saw some comments online about the ""message"" of the serie and how good and educational it is and how this serie make us understand our mistakes and blah blah and I was expecting to see that - but let's be honest, the serie is b u l l s h i t!(Don't let me start on the bad acting :S).----
From episode 1 to episode 10: The main character is some weak ass idiot that after all he went through he couldnt just get his shit together and get his daughther back! End of the movie :)I hope you dont waste 10 hours of tour life just like I did and I am so sorry about it!"
2555,Squid Game,"All the thumbs down. It's an inane, trite, heavy-handed slog that repeatedly insults the viewer's intelligence by having a character awkwardly explain scenes that just happened to nobody in particular."
2556,Squid Game,"This series has made me cry twice, a 33-year old male. I can't but give it a 10. Please go explore the capacity of human soul to feel more. After all, American cinema has failed at that a long time ago."
2557,Squid Game,Most rubbish thing i have ever watched in my life till date. Censorship on OTT platform is required to weed out such content.
2558,Squid Game,"Predictable and melodramatic to a fault. The treatment of the female characters was botched, the whole production felt unbelievably forced... And don't even get me started on the VIPs."
2559,Squid Game,The challenge is to get the end without the need to shoot yourself in the head! Acting pretty cringeworthy and drawn out far too long! Nice cinema photography though!
2560,Squid Game,Plot is predictable. Nothing new to offer. Better movies are there in this genre.
2561,Squid Game,Best evee but in SEASON 2 I HOPE SUNBYOUK CAN BE BACK WHAT EVER HAPPEN I DON'T CARE BECAUSE SHE WON ALL FANS HEART AND ALI NO.199 TOO.
2562,Squid Game,You must be happy in current movement which you have cause u don't know tomorrow u will be alive or not so enjoy every bit of life every breath is the matter of happiness if u know.
2563,Squid Game,"The English script was pretty dire and ruined what had been a pretty good series. The American actors were pretty bad too. Loved the rest. I was also a little put off by the ads on netflix, it looked scarier than it actually is."
2564,Squid Game,"Nutshell gripping, easy to binge watch, Not suitable for kids. Very dark and enjoyable A tad predictable. But the games were fantastic to watch. Agree with many on here the last 2 episodes were a bit rushed . Overall brilliant 👏"
2565,Squid Game,"Wow, I cannot believe this show! Ending was a bit
????? But overall excellent great work Netflix."
2566,Squid Game,I really enjoyed it and suggest this series to everyone I know! Perfect.
2567,Squid Game,"The story, the motif is great, but the conversation, the acting between characters are so lame.It could be a cultural things that Koreans speak that way.Just my opinion. Take it or leave it."
2568,Squid Game,"Surly it's overrated...credit goes to Netflix marketing team. They created so much hype for an average show. Play 6 games, who ever loses is dead that's it that's the story. Oh yeah and the lead character wins the prize money (as usual)."
2569,Squid Game,Squid games is a must watch series! It'll make you wanna binge all episodes in one go. It's full of surprises. It's a thriller as well and the Acting's great too!
2570,Squid Game,"One of the best series ive ever watched,i hope it gets renewed for second season."
2571,Squid Game,I'm not really into films with dubbing but this was done well so you don't even notice. Probably up there with my favourite every series.
2572,Squid Game,It's not a mind blowing series just a ok type series.the issue of this series is it's a boring series.starting was very slow and all those games are not interesting to watch.
2573,Squid Game,"With all the hype about this series, I thought this would be a fantastic series to watch.How disappointing it was, I stuck with it just waiting for something exciting to happen and to finally see why it was no. 1 on Netflix but that excitement never came. I was not sat on the edge of my seat nor did I long for the next episode to start.In fact, I must agree with the 10 producers and directors that refused to take this series on.And that woman's voice! It just shrieks through your head and rips your ears out until you have no eardrum left!!! The best part of this series was th titles at the end of the whole series. Thank god it finished, but I really regret starting it and being told it was something it's really not.My advice, give it a miss, You will just waste hours of your life for no good reason at all!"
2574,Squid Game,"It is a series of no's
1. No logic
2. No charecterisation
3. No thrilling games at all (Just some childish garbage)
4. No story (It moves to a stage where story is build to kill a charecter for nothing)
5. Finally, No need to see this !!!!!"
2575,Squid Game,I really enjoy every second of this TV show it's so perfect and amazing it deserves 10 out of 10.
2576,Squid Game,I like it so so much ... It was the first to end in first day ... But i think there will be season 2 bcs its not completed ... I hope its near bcs i can't wait.
2577,Squid Game,"This series is beautifully produced and directed. So many stories with in itself and has drama, action, suspence. I couldn't stop watching it. I hope they do a second season, or add more episodes.Beware parents not for children, lots of death, gore, blood, simulated dead bodies, violence."
2578,Squid Game,"With this amount of violence in this movie from every kind of people, from criminals to religious people this movie was just trying to show there is no humanity in this world. People are just killing each other and They show a bad face of them selves. Brother killing brother, best friend killing best friend and . . .This hole movie was just so pessimistic with just sad ending...And by the way some episodes were just wasting of time and they were no content in them, just made movie longer ."

"
5158,All of Us Are Dead,"When I heard of this Korean high school zombie series I was interested, despite the subject matter being done to death over the years. Then I saw the trailer and thought it looked amazing. Having just finished up the show, I can confirm that this is one of the most entertaining shows out there, and far surpasses the likes of THE WALKING DEAD. The small scale works a treat and somehow they manage to eke out the momentum over the whole 12-episode arc. It never feels too small and it never feels dull, packed as it is with expertly directed action and tense mayhem. The Koreans excel in this one and I loved every minute of it."
5159,All of Us Are Dead,I can't begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.The show doesn't fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn't very famous and that's good since you don't associate them with other roles that much.The 12 episodes just sped by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Hellbound and Squid Game.
5160,All of Us Are Dead,"So I decided to give the live action a go because I saw it's No 4 in Ireland on Netflix right now and I found out that it is based off a Webtoon. Yeah it's not a great art so definitely this was the better version personally! I may not be a fan of zombie themed stuff because they are always obvious and you know wtf was going to happen. I mean, this series isn't any different from every zombie flick out there but at least it puts some twists and turns to make you interested. I honestly was interested with how the character Na-ra was able to look less zombish and able to jump from the roof like a ninja?! Yeah I am assuming that cliffhanger would be left to s2 or just giving us poor audience a tease to make out what really happened in our heads. Even if the ending was pretty much a very questionable one, the characters, the music and the storyline in a way were entertaining enough. Yes it is clique in some parts with,using recycled horror tropes but again, I really enjoyed it and glad I didn't bother with the Webtoon..."
5161,All of Us Are Dead,"The show started gripping, quite interesting and super awesome in more than one instances with a stellar second episode (the best out of the lot in my opinion), but quickly got mixed in drama, melodrama and selfless / guilt-ridden sacrificial behavior and ended in a semi-dramatic and mutationally mysterious way.Infection, brutality, devilish evilness and gore gave way to cute friendship, proposals, long talks, chitchats, dramatic and melodramatic behavior with some sacrificial intensity here and there and in-between.I'm not against a second season and in fact i would love to see one coming to reality; it's just that the sort of drastic turn of events as depicted happily and mysteriously were sort of weakening and a more brutal, shocking variant and finale would have been more of service to the soul of the show."
5162,All of Us Are Dead,"The action of the zombies in this show is very realistic. It is interesting to watch the relationship between friends. Well executed until the middle of the series. From the ridiculous lines, to the moronic ""decisions"" to the horrible way they treated some characters. The typical Netflix-style ending was a bit disappointing, but I really enjoyed this show."
5163,All of Us Are Dead,"All of Us Are Dead: Zombie outbreak at a high school in Hyosan. South Korea. Most of characters are meant to be 16-17 but this is really an adult drama, when the students turn Zombie they bite out throats, take chunks out of people. Victims and Zombies alike jump and fall out of windows, frantic boys and girls barricade themselves in classrooms, battle against the Zombies. Fast moving action just like the Zombies who sprint about. Subplots about bullying and teen romance help the narrative along while the school principal wants to pretend everything is ok. A horror series which shocks but the terror is leavened by the teen love stories. The outbreak spreads. Zombie hordes charging at lines of riot police, even 3 deep they struggle to hold them back. Zombies munching on intestines. The dranas between the still human students becoming more intense. Refugees fleeing Hyosan are ""othered"", feared, even attacked. As so ften happens the authorities abandon the inhabitants of Hyosan while pretending to help them. It's an old trope but is given new life (or death) here due to the editing, acting and direction. How the Zombie virus was created is gradually revealed, it's root cause tied in with events which transpired at the school, you'll have to watch the series to put everything together, no spoilers here! Really convincing acting and effects. Directed by Lee Jae-kyoo and Kim Nam-su. Written by Chun Sung-il. 12 episodes on Netflix. 9/10."
5164,All of Us Are Dead,Zombie series with a very classic atmosphere and a very banal but still valid plot. In general the series is entertaining and at times has some very interesting twists and manages well to keep the tension. Many points are tragic and pay off. Too bad that after a while the series becomes a bit too monotonous because the protagonists run away and get stuck in a different point every time until the next episode and this thing in the long run a little tired.
5165,All of Us Are Dead,"Review By Kamal KSeason 1 - 6/10""All of us are dead"" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama's story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.Postive -EntertainmentEmotionsNegative -Plot HolesIllogical Things."
5166,All of Us Are Dead,"This is one off the charts crazy ride through hell. Wow!!If you enjoyed Train to Busan, you will love this. Insanely intense action and amazing character development and sub plots. Honestly, I could not stop binge watching.I can't praise this series enough. What an incredible ride!!!Well done, Netflix!"
5167,All of Us Are Dead,"On-jo: Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead.Probably the most infuriating show of this year so far. When I looked through this show, I was surprised that there's 12 episodes with 1 hour average runtime per episode. How can you make such a long show about zombies, one of the most saturated horror genres?Just as my suspicion, the first 4 episodes were utter rubbish. It added nothing new, just the zombies pandemic breaking out. At this point I was thinking: let's rewatch Kingdom or Busan rather than this. The only thing kept me forward was the unique way of how the pandemic started.Then episode 5 started, and the show picked up quickly with a new twist. It was very intense, chaotic, and unexpectedly funny. The characters were all hormonal kids, so they are bound to make stupid decisions amid a zombie attack. The twist was pretty good, and I think that it did enough to justify the existence of this show.Character-wise, some were just straight-up wasteful. The two most notable were Na Yeon and On-Jo's dad. Some characters were incredibly infuriating like Nam-ra. The rest were pretty straightforward.One thing that I have to point out. This show referenced Train to Busan, and made it clear that zombies movies exist in this universe. I think that it's supposed to be funny, but this really made the character decisions baffling. One kid pointed out this fact, but no one else seemed to be aware of this fact. The zombies acted pretty much exactly like in Busan and Peninsula. Couple of characters at one point killed zombies by stabbing the neck or head, but at another point had no clue how to kill a zombie. Like why don't they learn? It's an urgent situation, but they can't be that stupid.Overall, this show is filled with problems, but it still added something new and made most of the runtime intense and fun. 6.5/10."
5168,All of Us Are Dead,"I really liked this show and left reviews on a couple of episodes...but here Im going to talk about major plot holes that for some reason are not being discussed over the internet.So the high school science teacher must have actually created a cure that is neither shown nor does he talk about it. The problem is the cure was only temporary. He cured his son and his son went back to school. But he died or became angry and turned into a halfbie or something else. He could still talk, after fully transforming. But he never talked in any of the videos.Zombies are attracted to thunder and cannot see is thwarted by the flaresThe military does not save the kids saying they could be infected and not know it...By that logic so could everyone back at camp. Making the decision not to save the children completely flawed.Also maybe its a Korean or Asian thing, but why does the military commander kill himself after blowing up the zombies.And lastly i think...The half zombie girl jumps off the roof of the school...We were just shown that they still get hurt even if they can slowly recover...so she just broke both her legs on that landing.All the zombies are dead now so will season 2 be a vampire show?"
5169,All of Us Are Dead,"Having seen shows and movies like ""Goblin,"" ""Squid Game,"" ""Miracle in Cell Number 7,"" ""Train to Busan,"" ""The Flu,"" ""Love in the Moonlight,"" ""Kingdom"" and the Philippine made ""Block Z,"" I can definitely say that ""All of Us Are Dead"" is one of the most okay yet overhyped Korean series and Zombie flick on social media. Featuring storylines and premises done better in the movies and shows I have mentioned - like drama, romance and Zombies in a campus - the series is predictable and only adds one thing new: the ""Halfbies."""
5170,All of Us Are Dead,"I don't know if extreme bullying, to death, is what Netflix should be pushing on kids right now.I mean, who doesn't like a bunch of pointless hyper-violence, but that's all this otherwise cringey generic zombie movie has going for it. It's annoying, the characters are annoying, the lack of context is annoying... the random attempts at slapstick comedy out of nowhere are ridiculous...Insufferable female characters, super goofy doormat beta male characters... so you know Netflix made this, except unlike white shows, they don't seem to force any ""diversity"" on their Korean and Japanese productions, eh? Everyone's a black-haired Korean with a bowl cut. Now that's not an issue, but if everyone's a blond-haired white person suddenly Netlfix goes out of its way to replace most of 'em with (( black female and/or another woke-approved default race and gender )).Also I'm not happy that Lee Yoo-mi, who played one of the sweetest characters in Squid Game is now playing the pointlessly worst character ever. She's been turned into one of those insufferable female characters that the males are too simpy to throw off a roof. In fact all the female characters get to kick, punch and yell at the males, while they just take it like absolute betas. And if you're okay with this as a male - you're pretty much the same doormat. Welp anyways... PSA over.Watch #Alive instead, it's a much better zombie movie, and yes, it's a movie, meaning it'll take less of your time than binge-watching this trash.I gotta admit though, the cinematography and choreography are amazing, and so is the acting -- at least in the first few episodes. Most of the action-packed shots look like they've been done in one take, which is incredible. If only the writing was actually good, and the whole ""zombie bites someone and they get a veiny rash, then they're a zombie"" concept wasn't so grossly overdone. And all of this praise, again, is just for the first few episodes, because everything quickly goes downhill in terms of production quality and general effort after episode 3."
5171,All of Us Are Dead,"Korean Industry has set high expectations about Zombie movies and dramas. So,if I compare this with these than this is nothing infront of those masterpieces. It is an avarage Zombie drama about how the school students survives from Zombie Apocalypse. I find the reflection of ''High School of dead '' anime somehow. It is because both occurred at school and they kind of have similarities too. However,I enjoyed it without thinking more. For me maybe, 5/6 episodes would be enough. It seemed to be dragged a lot. As there were no survival techniques were shown, all are about running or climbing the floors again and again. There weren't much character development and plenty of plot holes. Most funny thing is some zombies don't even die after killing multiple times. What they are trying to convey? They are immortal??The ending is awful. I don't think there is any season needed, it was already dragged too much but they ended it this way."
5172,All of Us Are Dead,"The show started in a brilliant way and I thought this would be some unique in the zombie genre. As things were shown in a very realistic way. But, the way the episodes moved forward I started to lose interest. As I felt some middle episodes were so repetitive & lengthy. The show didn't deserve 12 hrs runtime. After finishing the season I can say the story would've been completed within 8 - 9 hrs max. One thing I can't deny is that this show was technically brilliant.Each character had its own story, it's not a problem for a series. But, in a Zombie apocalypse it has been shown in a very stretchy way. In the other hand, some characters didn't end up the way they should've been. As an audience we get to know so many things but the character didn't, that's the reason it was very disturbing to watch some scenes. Last 4 episodes were too much interesting and were the best episodes of the show. Good thing is that we get to know some good survival techniques.Finally, it's not the best in zombie genre but of course A Very Good Watch.Available on Netflix.© Zombieddict."
5173,All of Us Are Dead,"Meski sesekali melepaskan pijakan dari ruang lingkup sekolah demi menyentil aspek sosial-politik, series Korea ini tak pernah berhenti 'menggigit' lewat segala momen ketegangan dan emosi kehilangan di antara siswa-siswi dengan ragam karakteristik yang amat relevan.Kita sebagai penonton seakan ada di tengah mereka untuk turut merasakan takut, sedih, bingung, putus asa sambil menjaga asa bertahan hidup. Perlahan tapi pasti fokus dan keberpihakan diarahkan pada tokoh Lomon, Ji-hu, Chan-young, Yi-hyun lewat konflik percintaan/perundungan ala remaja.Lee JQ & Kim Nam-soo piawai memanfaatkan sisi geografis SMU Hyosan sebagai panggung teror berlapis sehingga tidak terkesan repetitif. Pergerakan kamera dinamis serta tata rias/kostum dan efek khusus yang terbilang di atas rata-rata berhasil menjaga ritme show secara keseluruhan.Zombie outbreak yang terjadi memang menyisakan banyak pertanyaan dengan simplifikasi logika yang cenderung masih dapat diterima nalar. Pola infeksi tunggal yang menyebar cepat bagai efek domino sukses membuat kita binge-watching atau mungkin repeat-viewing sambil menanti season 2 nya.(Hopefully soon and better, finger crossed)."
5174,All of Us Are Dead,"All of Us Are Dead is South Korea's latest entry into its esscalating body of undead mayhem (Train to Busan, #Alive, Happiness).All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who've managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse. With 12 episodes running 1 hr long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence, yet it sticks to the basics and delivers a positive outcome, although there's nothing new.All of Us Are Dead's zombie action is never not impressive. Whether it's giant chaotic crowd shots, massive ensemble brawls, or tricky ""oners,"" this is massively kinetic storytelling that will drain you as emotionally as it drains our heroes physically. Likewise, there are dozens of instances involving astounding body acting.All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.My Rating : 7.5/10."
5175,All of Us Are Dead,A Korean high school is the epicentre for a virus which turns the students into flesh eating zombies. The story centres around a small group of students and their attempt to survive as they are continually hunted. It is well acted and it tells the stories of the good and bad pupils which the zombies do not differentiate from when they mindlessly attack. It has plenty of individual introspection as friends and family fall victim and although not the best storyline each episode does enough to hold your interest for the whole series to discover the outcome.
5176,All of Us Are Dead,"I enjoy K-Drama with Train to Busan going down as a top 5 zombie movie of all time. In it, you saw the motivations for why people acted the way that they did.In this series, I think the mistake was having 12 episodes, meaning they had to stretch out the story using manufactured drama, lots of it, in every single show. There was no reasoning or explanation on people's actions and reactions(Episode 3 will make you toss something at your TV). Also, having a very weak protagonist who causes the death of other people is never a good idea. This series is more closely related to dreadful Army of Dead than Train to Busan. Most of the decisions are just plot devices for failure. At one point you stop caring who lives or who dies.The people who like this will be the same people that say Real Housewives is good reality TV or really liked Twilight. The rest of us is a no."
5177,All of Us Are Dead,"Although this is a Teenage horror. It is probably rated 19+ for the gore. The horror, as in other Kdramas ike Squid Game, Hellbound, is something other than the obvious. It is also about the people around you and bullying - even when you turned into a zombie.That's the clever part. But there are inconsistencies (like unnecessary sacrifices, stupid moves, and turning up the sentiments - parents dying ), some continuity issues in the beginning and maybe suffers a bit from a large cast. The chaos breaks out at end of episode 1 before all the characters were introduced just to grab your attention. And that is a bit hasty. We want entertainment, but we are not starved.At first there were multiple groups, including the cop that was interviewing the science teacher, the first aid x military dad, the arrow group and the main group in the music studio. This is needed to connect and elaborate the story but you know who is the main character group is. It would be too perfect for bullied girl to get even with the annoying bullying guy. There are some good plot points with mutation, rain/ thunder and toilet making.There are also well done set pieces like the intentional infection, rooftop scenarios and the dispair turning into some hope last episode. Technically well done but some holes like martial law can order such a strike without Parliament/heads of state approval? The assembly person seems to be a setup for next season? The rain gave them water, but no food for like 4-5days???"
5178,All of Us Are Dead,"This is what good television is but you should absolutely NOT compare it to other zombie series'. Anyway! Korean zombies are far more terrifying in their look than western TV and film zombies!The Zombies are just as terrifying as the ones in the other South Korean Zombie series'; like the excellent ""KINGDOM"" or the brilliant South Korean film ""RAMPAGE""! I love it and its good fun watchable television; better than any reality series trash!The only time that the series is/was calm and plodding along was in the first episode - before anyone turned Zombie - but after that it was a case of Shock, jump out of skin and a continuous Holy Crap viewing time :) Its come along just in time seeing that ""The WALKING DEAD"" will be no more each week...it had a good run though and was highly enjoyable viewing.Don't sit next to your girlfriend, sister or wife when watching this; unless you are wearing some kind of, good thick anti nails digging into your arm, protection! You will then be safe to watch some great acting and a lot of scary scenes!"
5179,All of Us Are Dead,"The unique thing about this series is, I think the first time ever happen since I watched the first zombie movie is it happen in the world where everyone know about zombie from movie. Its not like The Walking Dead where they dont call them zombie because in their world, zombie never exist, not even in movie. But, in this korean series, they call them ""zombie"" from the beginning. Sacrifice and responsibility plays a big role in this series, when people live in desperation, they never left their side of humanity. That's what make this series fun. Its a fun zombie movie with a lot of action and cliche from all zombie movie in history. Have fun."
5180,All of Us Are Dead,"There's a lot to unpack here, but the core problem is that there are maybe 6 great episodes worth of content in this 12 episode series.When it gets it right, it gets it very right. Love, loss, longing, poignancy, savagery and pathos, it's all there. The writing, acting and production are strong enough to get you engaged, so as the cast get chowed on, you'll feel it.However, it suffers from uneven tone, with too many cliched tropes and characters. Big-awkward guy, punky-girl, straight-laced nerd hottie, alpha and beta heroes, coward, and generic thug villain. You've seen them all before, many times.Some scenes eschew peril for jarring slapstick, which breaks you right out of immersion. There's far, far too much shrieking, repetition, indecision, repetition, pointless sacrifice, and repetition.Still, the effects, both practical, makeup and subtle CGI are top notch, the overall story arc is well conceived, and there are a few touching character developments.It's not amazing, but it's solid, and it ends strongly and credibly without pushing the To Be Continued too hard. Just about worth your time."
5181,All of Us Are Dead,"George Romero, the movie god who invented the modern zombie, always cast ordinary people as the characters in his films. He wanted zombies to represent us in a world of problems so relentless, so savage and so violent that they threaten to literally eat us alive. He wanted a world without death, with no end to our suffering, where we become the monsters when we die. He wanted the brutality to be banal, familiar and up close, where a world isn't saved by handsome Brad Pitt in three hours of pointless CGI.Everyone has problems, and that is why every country has zombie movies. In Romero's US, the zombies represent a population so self absorbed that they have lost track of what is important to them. Both the surviving humans and the zombies themselves seek refuge in a shopping center because consumerism has replaced idealism in this country, In Venezuela, the zombies represent the rapid disintegration after the madman who ruled the country dies. The Venezuelans who try to escape are killed by their own friends and neighbors. In Africa, the zombies are what happens when nature takes the land back from the humans who are trying to change it. In the UK, zombies make England's island isolation into a prison where escape seems impossible.You all know the movies. If you are reading this review, you like zombies.In Korea, zombies are about young people. Train to Busan is the story of a young girl who survives, but to what end? #Alive is about a young gamer. The Wailing is about the disintegration of a village.Korea is rapidly changing. It becomes more Westernized and industrial every day. The generation that lives through the Korean War is dying, and the ancient culture that sustained the country for centuries is being replaced by a First World country with cutting edge technology. However, Korea still sits between China and Japan, and the threat of annihilation from the crazy man in North Korea is ever present.To that end, this series is both the same old zombie by virus plot, but embedded in the daily horror of high school everyone faces. The bullies are nearly as awful as the zombies, the principal is an idiot, the teachers are a mix of caring and stupid, and the pressure to succeed is painful.Zombies invade a high school through the idiocy of a teacher. There are massive casualties as the kids fight for their lives, Only when it is obvious to everyone that all hope is lost does a teacher admit what has happened and tell the kids to leave. Then it is still every person trying to save himself. The virus that causes the zombie infection is stronger than human connection.Young Koreans face a world in which, no matter how hard they work or how much they care, they are not safe from monsters. Teachers don't care if they are bullied. Friends turn against them. And, everyday, they face oblivion.But they are teenagers, and they try.Romero would like this series."

5183,All of Us Are Dead,I love zombie flicks! From low budget to no budget to good budget productions. And I couldn't wait after seeing the 'This will blow you away' postings on social media. I decided to set aside the evening and binge watch it. But it was just disappointing. Are people so starved for anything zombie related these days that mediocre passes for mind blowing? I'm not sure. But I only made it a few episodes in before tuning out.
5184,All of Us Are Dead,"Very, very interesting, especially the last episodes of the series. The element of surprise is present in a way that makes the viewer stunned. Advice that is not related to any character."
5185,All of Us Are Dead,I really wanted to like this series. Interesting start. Lovable and hateable characters. Wayyyyyyyy overdrawn and annoying at times. They jumped the shark so many times.The plot holes are cavernous.It's so cheesy it's disgusting.It's pretty much anime in live action. Not in a good way.
5186,All of Us Are Dead,"This series started as weak for me, but it gradually became better. I thought some episodes could've been better if they were shorter--so much unnecessary scenes.There's some unpredictability in who survives and who does not, I love that. The zombies are definitely terrifying. I also like the fact that they threw some drama in it and made the characters have personality so that you'll at least care for some of them.Anyway I can't wait for season 2. I don't know how it will start because supposedly almost all of the zombies are already gone by the finale. But I'm interested in Nam-ra."
5187,All of Us Are Dead,"The first episodes of this series are wonderful, turning the Hollywood cliché of ill-mannered teens fighting zombies into an almost cartoonish depiction of zombie invasions. Fun. The action is well filmed, the acting adequate and the pacing for the first seven episodes tight and disciplined.Of course, the show is not without major faults, the biggest being characters just standing there as zombies attack, reacting only at the last second. I laughed every time because it plays into the MacGruber joke and does it too many times.Too bad ep 8 is so boring, The series tries to get back on track but loses its way with too much repetition (a sense of deju vu abounds throughout as the series progresses)."
5188,All of Us Are Dead,"Breaking from tradition, ""All Of Us Are Dead"" Season 1 on Netflix did not hold on to its core suspense until later. In fact, they dragged me into the thick of things right from episode 1. This Korean Horror series had what it took to become yet another jewel in the gilded crown of productions hailing out of South Korea.Directors J. Q. Lee and Kim Nam-Soo did great work distributing their talents across twelve outstanding episodes. Seong-il Cheon's screenplay was neat and did not fuss or bother with unnecessary drama. Hillary Huong Vu's VFX was remarkable. Together, their work cut to the chase and conveyed the show's chilling plot in a pace that can best be described as enviable.The story tracked a zombie virus outbreak that occurred in such a realistic, sinister, and unpredictable manner that I found myself smack in the middle of bloody chaos, just like the main characters were in ""All Of Us Are Dead"".Lee Na Yeon (played by Lee Yoo-mi) was exceptional. Lee Su Hyuk (played by Park Solomon) was captivating. Choi Nam Ra (played by Yi-Hyun Cho) was great. Lee Byeong Chan (played by Byeong-cheol Kim) was engaging. Nam So Ju (played by Jeon Bae-soo) was superb. Song Jae Ik (played by Kyoo-hyung Lee) was amazing. Lee Chung San (played by Chan-Young Yoon) was interesting. Park Mijin (played by Lee Eun-saem) was great.Nam Ohn Jo (played by Ji-hu Park) was good. On-jo (played by Victoria Grace) was compelling. Chang Hoon (played by Shin Jae Hwi) was good. Kim Ji-min (played by Kim Jin Young) was noteworthy. Son Myung-hwan (played by Oh Hee-joon) was superb. Han Gyeong-su (played by Ham Sung-min) was exceptional. Jang Ha-Ri (played by Ha Seung-Ri) was captivating. Jang Woo-jin (played by Son Sang-yeon) was good. Park Young-hwan (played by Dong Hyun-bae) was outstanding.All other cast and crew brought excellence to their roles and positions in the Netflix production ""All Of Us Are Dead"" Season 1. I wish IMDB gathered more crew credits for the show's page - sound effects, musical scoring, set decoration, art direction, hair-makeup, and costume design all did amazing work for this series.The tale took place at a high school, which literally became ground-zero for a zombie outbreak. As with most undead fare, one bite from the infected had the potential to infect a normal person and turn them into a monster as well.The unsuspecting students were soon scrambling for ways to escape the nightmare as more and more of them succumbed to the disease after being attacked. Chances for the remaining survivors to make it out in one piece grew slimmer by the second.It all began when Lee Byeong Chan tested something on a lab hamster. The rodent bit Kim Ji-min (a student) and passed the strange aggressive zombie virus to her. It was all 'hell broke loose' from there on, with the disease spreading into the city as well.Added suspicion lay with Lee Byeong, whose son had mysteriously disappeared a while before the day Kim Ji-min fell 'ill'. He blamed the school for his son being bullied, which allegedly led to the boy's suicide.What was the science teacher up to? What sorts of bizarre experiments was he attempting, and why? His reasons were revealed in the second episode, and they were quite convincing. Also, Lee Byeong's talk of the 'survivalist mentality' of a virus was intriguing.I was surprised when Kim exposed Lee to another teacher, and the rest of her class, in episode one itself. She apparently found a way to escape her plastic-ties, which Lee Byeong Chan had used to hold her captive in his lab. The policeman who was later involved in Kim's kidnapping case had ties to Lee (involving the Science teacher's missing son).""All Of Us Are Dead"" was 'zombie survivalist' gold. The show was interspersed with human elements and high school romance, and balanced with zombie-horror flourishes. They left mini-cliffhangers at the end of each episode, which was more than admirable. Watch the show in the original Korean language (use subtitles). Such soulful and compelling performances all round.""All Of Us Are Dead"" Season 1 on Netflix was a thoroughly entertaining deep-dive into zombie outbreak storytelling. There was a surprisingly strong emotional element to the series, especially in the finale. It only proved how masterful Korean filmmakers are at weaving a balanced story, no matter the genre's expected theme."
5189,All of Us Are Dead,"Impossible to believe the rating I tried but cant go beyond three episodes, do not waste your time. No matter how hard you try to ignore the characters stupidity, you will get annoyed. The script , acting, direction is so bad and poor as if either maker is without brain or he assumes the viewers are. Students attacking each other's but the principle is instructing the teachers to call them in class room, a girl is so dumb that she is trying to save her friend who is turned into zombie, a guy is so irritating instead of holding the door he leaves it open to argue with his classmate, the principle is hiding under the table and eating biscuits whole zombies are attacking in front of him etc etc.It's irritating annoying, feel like to throw the maker in front of zombies if given a chance."
5190,All of Us Are Dead,"Of all the books on the shelves and objects around, he takes a bible and smashes zombies with a bible, which is extremely offensive to any Catholic who cares at least a little about his religion. I do not recommend this to anyone of the Catholic religion. And now the review of the rest, I watched sync in English (netflix), the sync is extremely poorly done, so it's one iritating disaster of the sync. This series promotes violence and abuse (doh so of course zombies are involved, but not that, it actually promotes peer bullying and abuse). The scenes are sometimes too stretched it's really monotonous. It's too bloody and bizarre for some more serious impression. This is just another failed zombie screenplay, this series is a nightmare, no future there! Not recommend!"
5191,All of Us Are Dead,"This follows the well-known and highly successful Korean zombie movie formula that viewers have come to love. We mention here movies like Train to Busan, Peninsula, Kingdom and #Alive. Except for Kingdom, which is a series, all of these are feature films. In the case of Kingdom, the series succeeded in sustaining viewer interest all throughout.All of Us are Dead starts in an exciting way with its fast-paced and taut script. But by the time you reach episode 5, the viewer loses interest. While the lull moments are opportune time for drama, dramatic scenes gradually become a distraction. The surprise ending of that episode involving Gwi-nam tries to put back the story on track, but it appears belated.The young actors (Ji-hi Park, Yi-Hyun Cho, Park Solomon, Chang-young Yoon and In-soo Yoo) are competent. But a meandering story is the problem. At 12 episodes, the series is a bit too long."
5192,All of Us Are Dead,"A lot of zombie stuff has been done and there's only so much creativity you can come up with if it's already been done. So, when someone comes up with a new show, it's intriguing because I'm curious to see what's different about this one. This show is your typical Zombie but story set in a high school. It's got something for everyone.The zombie parts of the show were done REALLY WELL. Acting, action choreography, sound design, cinematography - everything was top-notch. Then there's your typical high school story that was a hit/miss. There's commentary on the society & family values - this added depth to the plot.Overall - it's a decent show with a lot of thrills but with minor pacing issues here and there, think Marvel trying to insert random jokes just because they can. They work, but seem out of place. The show has 12 eps, so this is a decent commitment. Could have been 8 eps, maybe 9.If you go down this road, you'll leave satisfied/non-disappointed by the end. If you'll be mind blown or not, is up to your taste."
5193,All of Us Are Dead,"This is the type of show you put on when there's nothing else to watch, or if you don't want something too complicated. Some really great acting in this one, I even found myself getting annoyed by some of the characters. Amazing CGI and special effects, definitely feels like it had a big budget. There were some plot holes of course, and some things were just left unexplained until the end but it doesn't really affect the viewing experience."
5194,All of Us Are Dead,"The Good: I could go on and on about everything I love about All of Us Are Dead, but if I had to point out a few ""killer apps"" that makes this show special, it would be:1) The Characters: I find this show fascinating for its characters. Most of them are well worn Korean TV tropes (the dashing hero, the quiet good girl, the selfish jerk) and none particularly stand out. What is fleshed out and what I observe to be a major cultural difference between Korean and American content, are the RELATIONSHIPS. Ultimately, what makes these characters great is how willing and capable they are in putting themselves on the line to save the group. The interpersonal dynamics, not unique or fleshed out personal characteristics, is what makes them super interesting to watch.2) The Writing: This show REALLY surprised me with the incredibly nuanced take it had on government and the military. The teens, immersed in hell with no one to come and save them, become naturally cynical of the ""adults"" who promise to protect them. The show could have played on the (frankly, lazy) idea of a ruthless, evil government turning its back on vulnerable people. Yet, we get to see the ""state"" perspective on these events as well, and the show forces us to consider the typical Hollywood version of events.If you were on the other side of the quarantine zone, would you not want your government and military to do ANYTHING possible from stopping the spread of a zombie virus? If your answer is no, you're lying.Even the leaders - political and military - depicted are given sympathy and we come to see that they're not purely motivated by personal desire, but a real sense of duty. When the Councillor gives a genuinely intelligent explanation as to why abandoning your post to save your family - as an emergency worker - is the wrong thing to do...my jaw hit the floor. I love a show that acknowledges that the world isn't black and white. It's refreshing.3) The Zombies & Action: Zombies are kind of overplayed. We get them, we've seen them. Half of the population thinks they could ""easily"" survive a zombie apocalypse. Yet, the zombies in All of Us Are Dead bring the horror back. These contorting, inhumane, unstoppable killing machines are legitimately terrifying and lead to some of the most intense and kinetic zombie action scenes I've seen in a long time. I think it's safe to say at this point that Korean zombies are objectively the most terrifying. It's with these scenes that the creators had the most fun with the camerawork and editing.Oh, and lest I forget, there's some AMAZING martial artistry at play in this show. Environmental action on par with some of the best kung fu...god I love this freakin' thing.4) The Narrative: There's a lot of fun to be had with this plot; we have multiple intersecting characters, half zombies, a Terminator style villain, government intrigue, a mad scientist. It's just a barrel of fun that keeps things going. Yet, this show is completely uncompromising as well; it is sad, depressing, and totally willing to off any character. The tension generated is insane and frankly exhausting at times.But, the ending - which again bucks the tropes - is surprisingly heartfelt and ultimately quite hopeful. It's almost reaffirming in how much faith it has in humanity and wonderful after 12 - often very intense - episodes.The Bad: I have basically two gripes with the show. One, it could've been cut down a bit and towards the end gets a bit repetitive. But, honestly, I came to love the story and characters so much that I didn't mind. However, I would suggest breaking the show up in chunks and not powering through it.The other issue the inconsistency with the virus itself. I guess some people are naturally immune, but it's a little confusing and sometimes comes off as a plot convenience.The Ugly: This show is super interesting for those (like myself) who love observing cultural differences (which is perhaps my biggest argument for steadily consuming foreign film and TV). Unlike Parasite, something that clearly came from a person who is a fan of Hollywood (and as such, it kind of feels less Korean, more international), All of Us Are Dead feels more grounded in South Korean culture.As such, there were countless moments when I thought to myself...""an American show or character would do X,"" in contrast to these characters. There's a much greater emphasis on duty (as a parent, as a first responder, as a teacher), saving face, hierarchy (upper classmen are to be respected regardless of whether they ""deserve it""), group interests over individual interests (all the villains are people who put their own goals ahead of the group) and so on. I found this aspect of the show to really put it over the top for me, as it felt very refreshing and different."
5195,All of Us Are Dead,"First of all, when zombie attacks started, I thought same thing like other comments ;'welcome to train to Busan', till now it ok for me I am on second episode. A little slow and too long but still ok. Some scenes are really good as a cinematography, Korean people knows how to make tension.I will not say this is a disturbing zombie series."
5196,All of Us Are Dead,"This show had me from the very first frame, the cinematography is what drew me in first, then the story and the actors all are excellent in their roles. There is so much going on in each episode and each episode is an hour or so Long. I'm on episode 7 and can't wait for my boyfriend to get off of work so we can watch the rest Tonight. This is a crazy good show."
5197,All of Us Are Dead,"Pretty standard overly dramatic k zombie, the way the characters written are pretty dumb, but then again they are high school students so i guess they were supposed to be dumb? The ever so often comedic bits are pretty much what gets me through watching the while thing. In conclusion, scientist oppar is hot af."
5198,All of Us Are Dead,"The idea of this show is fantastic. Feels new and fresh. Zombie outbreak starting in a South Korean school. I'm intrigued.The dubbing isn't great though which is a shame and some of the writing/acting is a little cliche/corny/cringe. Some decision making is unnecessary. (On-jo's dad basically giving himself up!)But I do like the show. Anything which a zombie apocalypse I'll give a go.Su-hyeok, nam-ra, dae-su, ha-ri, Chong-san are all brilliant characters, and I'm glad that there is some sort of happy ending."
5199,All of Us Are Dead,"It was pretty decent alot of stuff though did make me mad like why is nobody, throwing anyone turning out the window? What was the whole point of that girl being pregnant, why did nobody do as they saw others do and stab each zombie in the face or neck. Why did the girl in pink just die and become a full zombie if she was bitten by the bully kid and same for the kid on white with the bowl cut and naamra whose a super zombie? They did all this running around but there was food and sodas in the closet and nobody touched on that just the candy bar and doing abunch of work to escape a room where they had food and water or sodas. Where was the brains to find a way into the room. Is Chaesun the one who liked Onjo actually dead? Too many plot holes while watching this.But this was a great zombie series and was executed right and had me wanting to watch more and more and i loved the thriller aspect of this and how many people actually died and only a few made it out."
5200,All of Us Are Dead,"The problem with Korean actors is that you can't measure them by our standards. They act in a way that often looks like pure overacting, and maybe it is. In any case, it gets on my nerves so much that I can hardly endure a film or series from Korea for more than 30 minutes. On top of that, the quality of the content often leaves so much to be desired that out of desperation one begins to read something into it that is not there (Squid Game, Parasite). Hopefully the hype will soon come to an end. And this series here is nothing more than an appeal to the baser instincts of an undemanding young, predominantly probably male audience that feasts on disgusting scenes and is on its way to becoming a generation of jaded psychopaths."
5201,All of Us Are Dead,"After watching TWD FWD , Kingdom and then this and to be frank this had a vague origin story compared to others but what it did right was not waste time on dragging the story based on each cast for a recap which TWD does for a long long time. All of us are dead adds one important thing the evolution of virus and adding to varieties types of zombies which may or may not happen in the next season but they made the hype happen.So 10/10 watch it."
5202,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm a sucker for these zombie movies and shows. They always manage to pull me into watching it. Korea somehow manages to make zombies more interesting compared to western movies and shows. For example, Train to Busan was absolutely stellar. My hope was that this show was on the level of that movie. The premise is ""Set in the South Korean city of Hyosan, things go berserk one day when a girl in the Hyosan High School is bitten by a rat infected by a deadly virus that turns happy humans into devastatingly ugly and ever-hungry human eating machines"". So does Korea deliver another excellent zombie action or is it a big miss?Let's get the obvious out of the way first, the zombie action is indeed exciting to watch. There are some exciting and creative sequences in this show such as the dining hall sequence which is filmed like one shot. There are some other creative sequences such as one involving a fight between two individuals on top of bookcases while zombies are underneath. Another is where the characters build a giant wall to hold off zombies while they escape the other way. Another is where they create a circular wall while getting from point A to B. All these sequences feel very original and I certainly enjoyed watching them. I also have to give a lot of praise to the makeup artist as the zombies look frighteningly good. The zombie actors also do a good job as well in making them feel inhuman and unnatural. The zombies here are definitely quite scary and that is quite a feat considering how oversaturated zombies are in media.The actors all do a phenomenal job in their portrayal. They all manage to give their characters distinct personalities even if they are just minor characters. The actors who die and become zombies also do a great job as zombies. The story is also quite engaging despite just being mostly about surviving. The story focuses on the dynamic and relationship of the surviving school students. We see them work together but also argue and fight but it never feels over the top or anything. What the story does the best is in delivering on the emotions and there is definitely some emotional stuff. We also got a more interesting origin for the virus that is also quite sympathetic and we got some special zombies that give the situation more spice to it. They also spend a fair amount of time with the military in the series to give the audience an understanding of their response to the virus. There is also quite a bit of romance in this and it surprisingly works well despite the situation not being the exact best for this.However, there is a lot of characters in this show and honestly maybe too many. The show doesn't just focus on one group of survivors and instead multiple groups which lead to a lot of characters to pay attention to. What can be annoying is that a fair amount of these characters have nothing interesting to them but the series still spends a fair amount of time on them. If a character doesn't have an interesting backstory or personality then they are probably going to die which results in predictable deaths. There are also some characters that are just in the series for no reason such as a streamer that I felt added nothing to the plot apart from taking screen time away from actual interesting characters. Additionally, there are so many moments in this series where a character makes a really stupid decision that is frustrating to watch. Also, the characters not going for the head is a big annoyance. It also gets annoying when some characters stand around instead of helping their friend who is being attacked.The series is also a bit too long and can feel a bit exhausting to watch. It is 12 episodes but after watching, it definitely felt like the series could at least be cut down by 2 episodes. There is a lot of sequences where it does just feel like they are padding for time. For example, we will have scenes where we watch characters stand around or just building and not talking or a scene where they share chocolate and it all feels too long and pointless. There is a ""villain"" in the show and that person is WAY too overused and gets defeated in the same way like 4 times, to the point that it is kind of laughable. There are also some potentially interesting plot lines that they could've explored but it is never utilized or explored. There are also some characters that just die for shock value which sucks as it feels like the show would be more interesting if they were kept alive.Overall, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling and exciting zombie show that unfortunately stumbles on all the subplots created. I did come out a little disappointed that they didn't utilize everything the show introduced effectively but it was still a really good time. It does end with a potential tease for season 2 and it might resolve some of the remaining plot threads from season 1. The ending is also quite interesting and it does make me wonder what direction they could go in. Thus I am hopeful for a season 2 despite the show's shortcomings."
5203,All of Us Are Dead,I would rate this close to TWD in writing and special effects - the story came up a little short and the Direction was a little slow at times but on balance a surprise to be sure. It took a couple of episodes to get into the characters but the inter stories were compelling - the show runner my have made a mistake in killing off too many of the characters but the primary ones survived and might give Netflix enough to go with another season - the ending was intriguing and left the door open for a second season with a whole new direction - I will watch it if it does and recommend it for those that are into Zombie movies - my wife isn't but she has other really good qualities.
5204,All of Us Are Dead,"Although there were some minor illogic scenes but overall its good. Its not a waste even its a paid drama. Its too short though, should be 16 or 20 episodes.The ending reveals that there will be a sequel which I can't wait."
5205,All of Us Are Dead,"It's a really interesting series, and I'm enjoying it a lot. I am a big fan of Korean media in general. I really love how it explores the characters, and their relationship of the people in the situation, because I think it really gives good character development and you really root for them. They're more than clichés and stereotypes.The situations and story are very character driven. I also love the concept for the beginning of the whole thing.I really love how ridiculously heroic and dramatic some of the action scenes are. You think that character should definitely be dead, but they'll heroically kung fu kick, and parkour their way out. It's also not affaid to kill anyone off and it's a really good mix of that."
5206,All of Us Are Dead,"In the recent years Korean producers have been making good movies in the zombie sub-genre. Train to Busan, Netflix's Kingdom series etc and now: All of Us Are Dead. There are 2 points that I wanna raise here.First things first, the zombie-actors are simply marvellous! Look at those kids!!! I think some are really recruited from kindergartens and they have excellent performances comparable to many adult actors/actresses. Pound for pound these kids can overshadow kids in Walking Dead series. No bias, but Koreans are catching up.And secondly, it's the new concept. Precisely it's not exactly new or original, but it's rare in zom subgenre. Namely the ""asymptomatic"" zom. We've seen werewolves or vams or Hulk that can change form deliberately or casually or emotionally. But not always seen in zombies, yeah? I like this concept. Cool babe. It's makes the story much more intriguing. U never know the one sitting next to u is a norm or a zom.What's not that good then? Well, the mad science teacher. Yeah I know he has a very special background but, hey, look at him. He's not convincing at all. I don't mean he's a bad actor, but he's not that ""crazy scientist"" in all aspects. When I come to my senses I don't even believe he has sufficient resources to make any significant accomplishment in cellular biology projects. No no no, not even an compelling argument.As a conclusion, I love this series very much. Guys pls give it a shot. If u r a zom fan like me, ask your gal/guy to sleep first and then binge-watch it overnight. Worth your every minute ;)"
5207,All of Us Are Dead,"I felt compelled to write a review just because someone compared this to High School of the Dead. This wasn't similar in any way.I actually think the zombies in this show were quite horrifying. I liked the depressing tone, the scary visuals, and the gore. I liked that anyone could die at any time. There were a lot of terrible decisions by the main cast, but overall I found this to be enjoyable."
5208,All of Us Are Dead,"I like watching a good zombie movie or show from time to time. So I gave this show a chance after seeing the trailer. Overall I'd say it's decent but has various problems as well.I think the acting overall is fine but I'll say that I watched it in Korean with English subtitles. As always you may want to be careful with English dubs.Something I've noticed with Korean shows is that kids/students seem to be pretty nasty and unlikable overall. Is that a common thing in South Korea? You got bullies that actually are pretty nasty criminals and other kids that basically just go along with the bullies where no one speaks out. In addition you have a school where teachers and the principal are more focused on appearances than actually teaching the students. Well, maybe it really is reflecting real life...In this you then have a zombie outbreak scenario where to be honest I thought a lot of those characters deserved to die. The one good thing I want to mention is that the students call these things as what they are => zombies. I always get annoyed when shows try to be fancy by inventing new names for what clearly is a zombie (""walkers"" for example). The police, soldiers and other officials never call them zombies though.The zombies overall are really inconsistent. Characters are either dying right away or will have a thick plot armor. The students in their capabilities are also very inconsistent. For the most part they will not really fight but run away. Then in some situation they seemingly suddenly mutate to combat and strategic experts just to then forget about that a few minutes later.There is focus on some characters which makes it appear they will play a bigger role later on and then they are just killed off with no real impact. Also the way the whole situation is resolved towards the end of the first season is a bit of a letdown. I guess they were trying to create a complete story in case they will not be renewed for a second season while still keeping the door open. The result is leaving me a bit unsatisfied."
5209,All of Us Are Dead,"This series has it all:
ActionGoreSurpriseThe unexpectedand addressing the mundane questions we often mutter, but are not normally addressed - i.e. 'how do we go to the bathroom?'I really enjoyed this series. Each episode is quite long but giving enough time to learn about each character and the situation they are in.Just as you think you have guessed what will happen a curve ball is thrown and it takes a different route to the one you were expecting. In summary this is a series about zombie survival - a story which is way over played - but there is something about the series which tackles the subject in a different way.Characters are killed off you wouldn't expect to be killed off... gore happens when you don't expect it to happen... and the overall surprise of it all makes 'All of Us Are Dead' compelling viewing.If you enjoy zombie survival films then give this a try. 8 out of 10!"
5210,All of Us Are Dead,"I have nothing really negative at all to say about this show it's pretty perfect! Just enough episodes and character arch stories and build, each episode wanting you to keep going. Lots of drama, thrills and omg moments, I cried a lot because this was making me an emotional wreck. I just love it! The cast, the pace of the show! I really hope they continue as there is still more to unfold with it's ending and the hambie's!"
5211,All of Us Are Dead,"This is a big budget, large cast, tightly-scripted zombie (near) apocalypse TV series written as a miniseries. I'm saddened to think that there might not be a season 2 since there was complete closure at series end.Very bingeable, great character depth and development as the series progresses. I had one problem with the series that keeps it from getting a higher rating (it's an 8 rating, a 10 rating for overall entertainment):There were too many scenes where the core group of students just stood there like deers caught in headlights, while a single member of the group did most of the battling. Also little prep, no weapons.It happened too often and it wasn't until a second older group of students emerged (senior class, the archers) that appeared more suited to surviving and behaved more like expected. They also understood the importance of arming themselves.I understand the paralyzing fear and their younger ages (+/- 16 years) being a factor. I understand that this is how any younger group might react (so it was well-written in this regard) but it was still frustrating to see this as an adult.Side note: This is the fifth South Korean TV series I've watched in the last few months. All (except 1) have been really good TV.Recommended (in no specific order):-- Hellbound / JioK-- Squid Game / Ojing-eo geim-- All of Us Are Dead / Jigeum Uri Hakgyoneun-- Sweet Home / Seuwiteuhomxx The Silent Sea (Failed for me)On my watch list:-- Glitch / Geullichi."
5212,All of Us Are Dead,"""All of Us Are Dead"" marks the latest high-budget Korean release from Netflix, fighting for room in a genre already groaning from the weight of the likes of ""Kingdom,"" ""Squid Game"" and ""Hellbound.""Posh Hyosan High School and its affluent pupils think it's going to be just another day of working towards tests and surviving the bullies, deadlines and awfulness of puberty that high school crams daily into 7 hours. But then one student comes stumbling in, claiming a teacher abducted her, and before lunch is over, the entire school, save for a handful of stragglers, will either be dead or dying.Netflix's show sets up its premise well. The premier, having to do a hell of a lot of world building, manages to establish key characters and relationships without too much exposition, and finds some potential drama and tension it can explode apart later. Then the promise is fulfilled in episode 2, which begins with an absolute massacre in the school cafeteria as the confusion and fear of what is happening mixes with more blood than a Wes Craven film. Beautifully shot and well executed, it never lets the gas off the pedal.Sadly, the show then begins to fall under the weight of what it wants to do, and what it needs to do. We get four main threads to follow involving politicians and rescue services, a good natured police officer, and two main groups at the school. That's not including the parents, other surviving school students or faculty, or secret services that need paid attention to, also. By episode 5, there's so much going on (and so many barriers to any progress) that the momentum stalls and the show, despite the numerous chase scenes, resembles a dog chasing its tail.Further, the characters are just horrible. Not badly written, no, but evil, inconsiderate monsters. One may forgive them on account that they're young, privileged and facing a fantastical problem, but even resident bully, Gwi-Nam, is just one of many monsters wearing people faces. It gets tiring to see the students sabotage and ruin one anothers' chances over and over again. Redemption is a banned word in this universe, and Neitzche would likely baulk at the pessimism on display.Lastly, the zombie virus is just too complicate to understand. In this world, some people don't fully turn, allowing them to develop super powers while maintaining their identities. I don't understand how a virus can increase strength and speed without boosting muscle mass, but here we've got kids going at each other like a Rita Repulsa monster smacking down the Power Rangers. Who gets this mutated virus is also arbitrary, with only three people getting this lucky dose (and obviously each is integral to the story).Still, when all is said and done, there's some great fun to be had here. The first four episodes alone are worth catching, and as the kids' relationships take center stage in the middle, the cast prove proficient at being good dramatic actors. Even as it lags, there's no denying it's a treat to watch, with scenes of destruction exploding into zombie herds chasing down unlucky survivors. The tension, as threads are cut, snaps in a very satisying way. But, in the end, it's five episodes too long, and plays the same cards too often to be as successful as, say ""Kingdom."""
5213,All of Us Are Dead,"My boy said about this, so I sat down and started the first episode, what rubbish.I only got half way through it and it had to be turned off.How the hell can this been rated at 7.6 god only knows.It is terrible, do not waste your time....!"
5214,All of Us Are Dead,Koreans really know how to make a zombie flick!Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.Two episodes in and it's mayhen and chaos all over the school!As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.Freaky zombie outbreak like I've never seen before (only in Train to Busan).I can't wait to see how it all plays out.
5215,All of Us Are Dead,"The serie is quite fun to watch but it doesn't bring anything new or special, unfortunately because sometimes these kind of movies from South Korean production companies can be a hidden gem (i.e. Train to Busan). However, it is really a South Korean zombie production so if you don't like that, don't bother to watch it. However, it doesn't meet the level of TWD but it definitely is much better than FTWD.For those who love South Korean zombie production, All of Us are Dead is worth to watch. Sometimes it is a bit annoying and slow that you start to wonder whether you are watching a highschool serie. However, I binged it in a weekend and I kinda got into the main characters of the serie. I just hope that Netflix won't kill this serie and that it will order a 2nd season as the story got potential for another interesting zombie season."
5216,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm not giving this a rating because I've only lasted two episodes. The action scenes are very well done -- high school kids make wonderfully enthusiastic, energetic extras, whether they're twisting and twitching as man-eating zombies or frantically fleeing the same man-eating zombies.But the scenes without zombie action are ridiculously amateurish: stiff, slow, and lethargic. I began to lose patience when a bunch of high school students, having narrowly escaped the zombies that have overrun their school, feebly barricade themselves inside a classroom and stand around calmly musing how best to phone the police.The scene drags on like a slow dinner party. Two girls stare out the window and literally chat about their teenage relationships (one of them grinning impishly), while just a few feet away, separated by thin panes of glass, a mob of red-eyed students-turned-zombies wave and growl and hungrily gnash their teeth.Zombie movies are by definition silly. Still, if they're to work, the human characters in them should behave with at least some semblance of reality."
5217,All of Us Are Dead,"After squid game, Korea did they it again! Don't watch the trailer, it will spoil so much. This one is highly recommended, it's wild, entertaining and engaging. There is no nudity,sex and this show feels so real. It's super awesome starting from the 3rd episode. Also a cliffhanger at the end of every episode. Ending is satisfactory. Hoping for the 2nd season."
5218,All of Us Are Dead,"Since I love the zombie genre and South Korean zombie shows (i.e. Train to Busan, Kingdom, etc) I knew I was gonna give this one a try. If you love guts, blood, and gore I can say this show has plenty of it! If you like whiny teens that make absurd decisions, well, unfortunately this show has plenty of that too! The premise is not unlike other types of zombie shows. A virus gets out and there starts the zombie outbreak. At least with this series, you know pretty much from the beginning how it started and then the why it started develops as things move along. I will say things get tedious when episodes end up with the same scenarios and stuff, so in my opinion, this series could have easily been 9 or 10 episodes instead of 12. Luckily, when the tedious parts occur or the whinny teens start up, the fast forward button comes in handy! The teens, and even adults, make the dumbest decisions in many cases. But, I guess that comes with the territory in all zombie shows and movies. The ending leaves the door wide open for a second season, but I don't know how far they can take the idea of the ""different"" zombies (don't wanna give anything away, but it's a premise we have seen before.) All in all, mostly entertaining with a few down time moments. If you like this genre and like Korean movies/tv shows, give this one a try. And please use the original language and subtitles. Way better that way!"
5219,All of Us Are Dead,"Some pf the places in the scnerio there was problems but its still a very good Zombie scnerio. First of all they dont know how to seperate human/zombie mix.. but it is easy. They are very sensitive with sound, they dont eat normal food, they heal in couple of hours.Some of the bite scenes easily can stop but others were just waithing around. Korean's did again very good job. I love the show. I finished all the episodes in one breath. Reactions were very real, their human needs were very real. Very nice details. Perfect."
5220,All of Us Are Dead,"All of Us Are Dead doesn't disappoint if you (like me) like a zombie film/series. There's plenty of zombie action and lots of gore, it's a fun show.Just don't expect too much from it, it's a zombie series after all, it's not meant to be taken that seriously. I found it to be an entertaining watch - good cinematography, effects, acting and direction.It has its flaws, the biggest one for me being that there isn't really much of a narrative there, it's just a lot of ""oh no, there are zombies trying to get us, we must escape"" kind of thing, but I still liked it for what it was.If you like the genre then you'll probably enjoy it, if not, don't watch it."
5221,All of Us Are Dead,"Solid zombie high school K-drama. Beautiful and memorable precious things about High schools and friends are shown inside this show. Suspenseful, heartbreaking and very interesting! Legit acting. This tv series deserves recognition. Overall, very promising and recommend to watch."
5222,All of Us Are Dead,"..if the zombies in Train To Busan arent enough for u, then this Kdrama will satisfy your needs! I love every episodes! Literally the best Kdrama of the year!"
5223,All of Us Are Dead,"This is a good zombie series, well scripted and does not get boring. I don't know if they are going to make a season 2, but it seams open to it. Wanted the ending to be more happy, but it still seems sad."
5224,All of Us Are Dead,"This show has been pretty good thus far as I feel they have stepped it up a notch from the last Korean Zombie series called ""Kingdom"".The special effects look more realistic of the blood spewin from the zombies necks compared to previous korean zombie series and movies also.I dont like watching anything Korean but I do love their zombie stuff cause its always got superb acting. Out of all Asian zombie movies/shows i would say Koreans ranks the top as I have seen some very terrible ones from I believe Thai Or filipino and also Indian zombie series that were trash.Western Zombie stuff is different then the Korean ones from the way they look too how they transform into zombies.What western shows like The Walking Dead lacked was that it became to easy too kill zombies that their was no immediate danger. As well as the zombies all walk slow vs in the korean series they run and move fast and every encounter becomes a very close escape.I seen some bad reviews on here but i feel these people are not giving it a fair judgement. Some complained about how its repetitive like other zombie shows but when u rate a show/movie u should be rating it for itself and not comparing it to other movies/shows.Thats where Bias mindsets always kick in cause they always keep having expectations set already of comparing it to previous zombie shows or even worse is when people compare how an actor acts in other movies vs current ones.So give this show a chance and dont rate it against other shows, thats not giving it a fair chance at all.Just rate it as it is and how it is presented and you will find you will enjoy tv series n movies more then always having a closed mindset with full on expectations of how it shouldnt be or should be directed n written n acted."
5225,All of Us Are Dead,"This is a decent zombie flick. High school students tried to survive a zombie outbreak at their school. Of course, it would not be a young adult flick without love stories, friendship stories, bromance and .... bullying. You would expect that, wouldn't you?!One thing I would like to add for future zombie script writers. Zombie movies have been around since 1978, so the terms zombie outbreak and its symptoms are not an unknown thing to people nowadays. But every zombie movies always begin with an outbreak that looks like nobody know what it is or what to do. Please, next time write a zombie flick which the protagonists are aware of it and know what to do about it. It would be a refreshing story.Worth watching 8/10."
5226,All of Us Are Dead,"I have to admit, the first 15 minutes didn't grab me. However, I stuck with it and it's turned out to be one of my best series I have ever watched. The young actors and actresses were amazing. The storyline played out every sort of emotion. Even though each episode lasted around an hour, we ended up watching four episodes back-to-back as we were SO hooked. Utterly brilliant and a great ending."
5227,All of Us Are Dead,"Absolutely. Totally unexpected, but such charismatic characters played with finesse in a story line I never expected would hold my interest. Every once in awhile, Korea presents an amazing series with fascinating characters masterfully portrayed. This was a beautiful series with a background of enigma and moral ambiguity."
5228,All of Us Are Dead,Let the bullies be the heroes. Let everyones reactions be strange. Let's not establish any character development. Well that pretty much sums this series up.
5229,All of Us Are Dead,"I liked the series. Especially viewing how Korean kids typically behave in their normal environment.As to the zombies, they are pretty standard and the kids make the same moves as in most zombie flicks. Ex: staring for seconds too long before reacting, then jumping in to sacrifice themselves, etc Basically, what kids would likely NOT do.But I still enjoyed it immensely. It's a fast paced energy thrill ride."
5230,All of Us Are Dead,"First, I want to point out that I've never seen a series of any sort that has this level of action choreography. I mean from EVERYONE, even the zombies and extras. I've also never seen a series take such advantage of a set before. The verticality is impressive. Everything is over/under/through, and it makes for an incredibly refreshing experience. This is claustrophobia done right!I watched the English dub, so I can't comment so much on original dialog, but the dub was acceptable, and the actors certainly emote well.I have to knock off a couple points for some of the character choices/motivations that just don't make a lot of sense. We have a young lady infect/murder a kid because he's poor (I think?). We have a military leader that kills himself out of shame after bombing the hot zone? Other weirdness might be chalked up to my ignorance of Korean culture, but I don't really understand a girl beating a kid who professes his love to her, or the girl who wants to die because of some risque pictures being sent to classmates that are all already dead, and don't have access to their phones anyway?Finally, I think most of the 12th episode really just existed to leave things open for another season. I don't think it should been included.Hiccups aside, I had fun watching this series. It was exciting, visually gripping, and despite its flaws it kept me binge-watching to the end."
5231,All of Us Are Dead,"Not sure what to make about the people giving this rave reviews. My guess is they're really young or just paid accounts. This series was very disappointing (as usual with Netflix). Poorly written, acted and execution. If you're looking for the next Squid Game this ain't it. Not by a wide mile. Trust me on this, skip this low budget trash."
5232,All of Us Are Dead,"Guess what this Gen Z said ""This show is so violent "" lol what ? This is zombie apocalypse not romance, do you think this is Hollywood when there's kisses and nudity and cringy criticism? No this is korean they work so hard , they have incredible actors and all the crews behind camera , this is not WARM BODIES OR WORLD WAR Z , if you want no violent shows go somewhere in Netflix you will find bunch of garbage, btw I loved this series and I hope to see more of this story in future because we all now that netflix doesn't care if you liked or not ,they care about views numbers if this is successful so 100% there's s2 and 3 ."
5233,All of Us Are Dead,"This is gonna be one of the best show I've watched this year. The production, directing, characters, performances & everything else is truly superb. I have not binged watch many shows (except Daredevil & Squid Game) because they just don't hook me into them but i was hooked to my screen from the first 5 minutes of this show & binged watched it till the end.Now the performances of every actor was great. I genuinely loved all of the friends, supporting cast & bad guys too. It also reminded me of my school days with some good memories in the first episode. I think this one got it all from being funny to make us emotional & yeah the zombies too that were great!You know this one's underated when extremely below average & dumb Netflix shows like Money heist, Lupin etc., or the other Marvel's Disney+ Hotstar shows got above 90% on rotten tomatoes & shows like this got below 80%.Overall a highly recommend show to binge watch with your friends or family (No unnecessary sex scenes or nudity) . Waiting for the next season."
5234,All of Us Are Dead,It's another wild ride from the Koreans definitely worth watching. Will keep you entertained for a weekend. There are some annoying things about characters I wish they could fix then they really would be superb. The lack of emotions and chemistry between the actors. They are great actors but we need to see a range of different emotions and expressions conveyed. For example you rarely see smiles just dead pan expressions.
5235,All of Us Are Dead,I like how the characters are facing zombies without using guns and instead use everything they can as a weapon. In most of the zombie media I've seen characters often use weapons to defend themselves instead of coming up with clever ways to kill them.
5236,All of Us Are Dead,"As a zombie series its decent. What is groaningly bad is the dialog and situations. ""She likes you, are you going to date her?"" A girl worried about embarrassing photos. Students bickering about juniors verse seniors. Really? During a zombie outbreak? Drags it down with a campy feel like a low budget teen flick. And, too often, when things go bad everyone stands and stares instead of doing something or running away."
5237,All of Us Are Dead,"Its a good zombie show, was slow at parts but i overall enjoyed the show. Best thing about korean dramas on netflix is i don't have to watch force diversity or identity politics that are plaguing the U. S t.v shows."
5238,All of Us Are Dead,"I am a fan of zombies and Korean movie industry has built some good reputation in this matter. BUT this series may have pulled down the reputation because this series is so bad such that I wonder if it was directed by teenagers.Bad acting!Good thing is that the mystery got explained very soon in the second episode (if you can go that far).Those creepy/zombie scenes are totally predictable and common in a zombie-themed series/move so they can't be constituted as a reason to give applause to this series.Too many scenes are not logical at all. For instance when Onju was pressed against the floor by a infected male student, what should be expected is she simply can be bitten. But no, apparently she holds the fight and get away with the zombie. But wait! One second ago she is too terrified to move and next second she fights back the zombie.And the extinguisher can also defeat zombies?It just a tip of iceberg showing how bad this series."
5239,All of Us Are Dead,"Despite some flaws, this show is a pretty good zombie series and I was rather surprised at how binge-able this was.It did a very decent job of presenting gore, mystery, thrill, drama and--of course--romance. The overall effect of the plot is captivating that you find yourself drawn in. The makeup on the zombies is extremely disgusting, which superbly serves its purpose. The mystery and thrill of the story does a good job to keep you glued to the screen, wanting to know what happens next. Although a lot of characters remain flat, I'm glad they aren't all so one-sided.My biggest gripes of this series are 1) how quickly they get rid of characters without giving them a chance to really make an impact or finish their stories 2) the frustrating decisions some characters make leading to dumb consequences (seems like a theme for a lot of horror/thriller movies, which could be fixed). 3) The color of blood on the costumes at times feel a bit too pink, but that's coming from someone who works in film. 4) The CGI feels very unrealistic at times, which takes you out of the film. If these elements were done better, I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more.If you're into zombie shows, this deserves a shot. It has a lot of gore, endless action sequences, mixed with different character relationships and thrilling nailbiting moments."
5240,All of Us Are Dead,"I wanted to watch this series for a very long time but resisted myself because I know that South Korean thriller series' are generally hideous, hopeless and hollow. However, these kind of series are a kind of guilty sorrow for me. I had to watch it.I am quite impressed, I should say. It is like an anime. 2D characters, all stuck in this unbelievable action flick, everyone wanting to survive but most die. Start watching it with less expectations, you will really get to like it.As I said before, it is an anime kind of film cent percent. So, expect things to go berserk and OP. If you love such kind of films/series, go watch it now. You won't regret!"
5241,All of Us Are Dead,"All of us are deadBursting with well executed zombie action scenes and a plot that's as emotional as it is dire and dreadful. It is also teeming with an array of characters that you would love and hate. It starts and ends well, in a way that accommodates a second season if approved.It was also overly long and drawled, leaving room for so much redundancy. A lesser number of episodes with shorter runtime would have worked better."
5242,All of Us Are Dead,"I had little expectation when I began streaming this show but am very pleased with it. It's about teenagers and there's campiness involved along with the drama. Very tongue in cheek which makes it a nice reprieve from all the over-the-top zombie action. Good character development, excellent dubbing, good storyline. Although the scene of the Captain's escape and swimming away amidst a crazy barrage of bullets with only one bullet barely grazing him made me laugh... that's why you can't take this so seriously. I also love the references to Train to Busan (which is one of the best zombie movies out there). This is very entertaining and worthwhile if you like this genre."
5243,All of Us Are Dead,"Korean shows tend to be really hit or miss for me. Sweet Home, My Name, and Squid Game are all great shows with well-developed characters who act in a believable way given their situations. This show is definitely a miss for me though. The writing seems to focus only on making things dramatic; characters do terrible and dumb things for no discernible reason, since in many cases they haven't been developed enough. The kid on the roof who we barely know screws everyone over because... reasons? The Military commander is ruthlessly evil in some scenes and then in other scenes tries to take the high ground and and lament what they have to do, and it just doesn't feel coherent. The writers also forgot that humans need water to survive, even though one of the students says in one of the earlier episodes that they are already dehydrated. It even starts raining at one point and NOT ONE PERSON thinks to get a bucket or something and collect some drinking water. The EMS father finds a stockpile of guns and only brings one because ...? And then he gives his only gun away before he even gets to the school? Soooo much stupidity in this show. I could go on and on but you get the point. If all you want is drama and you don't care about character decisions making sense, then by all means give this show a go. But if you are the type who gets annoyed when characters behave in dumb or unbelievable ways, stay far, farrr away."
5244,All of Us Are Dead,"The series is great but considering 12 episodes are still a little bit too much 10 episodes are good to go. You'll get hooked up in the whole series every episode gives a thrilling sensation but there are still many flaws in this series that should've been better and many people should've been alive if it is not because of the selfishness of some students. The series is lacking common sense that made you go mad for some reason just by watching how they deal with such an incident. I don't know if the scriptwriter/director is dumb or this is all part of the plan that they're supposed to look stupid and act stupid. Overall nice series but not favorite as Kingdom, Train to Busan, #Alive, etc. Still it can be done better, definitely worth to watch but not worth to watch for the infinity."
5245,All of Us Are Dead,"First things first, this series has insane amount of gore. So it's a warning, anyone who is sensitive or cannot tolerate gore should stay away from this series.When I finished 2 episodes of this series I thought, ""what is new? It's that usual zombie survival series that Korea produces every year"". I felt it was like ALIVE but set in a school rather than apartment. Moving further into the series I realized, it is not usual.Zombie survival series are always interesting no matter how old they become. Having watched so many zombie based films/series, I now find those snarling open mouthed zombies absolutely hilarious. Either they look disgusting or they look hilarious.However, what makes this series so different from the other zombie ones are these:-1. The fact that it deals with the mental state of the bullied school kids who get no help or comfort, like how Eu-Jin wishes the school burns down and everyone gets killed after her being bullied. This results in grave consequences later in this series watch out for that.2. The fact that the zombie virus is justified this time. Most of the time we get only a faint detail of the infection but this time, through the videos of the professor, we get to witness a lot of details about the virus.3. The fact that the makers have decided to introduce a new kind of zombie into the series which later turns into a grave danger for all.There are many more new elements in this series and that's a huge plus point for a genre that normally doesn't get much different treatment.Loopholes, quite a lot including some really illogical scenes that I could not help but scratch my head at those points and the fact that the series is unnecessarily stretched. Each episode is about more than an hour long (honestly, it is just 1 hr on average considering credits start playing with 5 mins left at end) and there are 12 episodes. You really feel the drag when the student gang talk and share their feelings amongst themselves on a rooftop and these were some parts I genuinely skipped.Overall, I think the makers did a good job by introducing new unique elements into this zombie series otherwise I was ready to bash up this series left and right had it been that usual zombie survival series that are available in millions on Netflix."
5246,All of Us Are Dead,I actually find it quite slow and boring. I am on episode 4 now but going to skip a few. Maybe something will happen instead of every episode the same.
5247,All of Us Are Dead,Who greenlit this to be a 12 episode series? It's so dragged. No story just talking talking and more talking for 12+ hrs. It should have been just 6 or 8 episodes. Wasted potential.
5248,All of Us Are Dead,"One can easily relate with the characters with lots of emotions,humour&spine chilling moments that will carry u along the series.....with the major supportcoming from the make-up and vfx dept and as usual koreans are known for their screenplay perfection this series is a must watch."
5249,All of Us Are Dead,"I looked forward to this kdrama and the trailer was quite good as well. So, I had expectations for it. I even completed reading the Web toon to get ready for the watch.But, it was kind of disappointing. I directly compared this drama to ""Happiness"", which is another Zombie centric drama that was aired just mere months ago. While ""Happiness"" had a lot of things right and had found a right balance between the Zombie action and human interactions, ""All of Us Are Dead"" was just mindless actions in most of the episodes. Sometimes quite repetitive to the point that we can easily predict the outcome.I liked the four leads, but other than the characters of Lee Cheongsan and Nam Ohjo which were built well, Lee Suhyeok and Choi Namra's characters could have given much depth. Especially Namra's who had the most interesting character arc. But hers was not explored till the last episode.Likewise there were so many things that fell short of expectations. Including the final explanation that the Webtoon carried. Anyhow, the drama is still enjoyable and the action is good. The settings and choreography are well done as well.Good effort. But overall, the drama is just okay."
5250,All of Us Are Dead,"I was quite excited when I first heard about another zombie Korean thriller. I didn't particularly have high expectations for this one but I did hope it would be memorable. It's way too long with many unnecessary plotlines. I think it could have been perfectly wrapped up in 8 episodes if properly executed. The main characters were dull to me and I couldn't relate to any of them,especially Nam Ra.There were way too many foolish decisions that were only introduced for shock value and character development. I don't see myself revisiting this show unlike the others I've watched of its kind."
5251,All of Us Are Dead,"I totally love these South Korean series. They are inventive, beautifully made and fun. And there is always a subtle, gentle and tender message. Yes it's a zombie serie but it is somehow sweet. Actors are great and very likeable and direction is brilliant full of inventive touches.BUT..please,please,please find some decent English speaking dubbing actors and translators. These are absolutely painful."
5252,All of Us Are Dead,"Loved this! I don't think there was a single episode that didn't keep me on the edge of my seat!It had a little of everything, plenty of violence, funny moments and some really touching moments which won't be everyone's cup of tea if they just want a run of the mill zombie movie!I thought it was fantastic, ended on a cliff hanger so already looking forward to the next season!"
5253,All of Us Are Dead,"It's not as bad and it's not as good as people are saying.Some of the contrivances in this are just insane. Your suspension of disbelief has to be at an all-time high to excuse some of the characters ridiculous/poor decisions. Now, that doesn't make it a bad show. BUT, it does mean you'll be sat there yelling things like:""Omg close the door behind you!""""Would you run, run, like seriously! RUN! You have so much time!""""Just tell her! Omg just tell him! Talk to each other!... OMG!""Why are you still standing there? DO SOMETHING!""""Can no one see that? It's right there, are these people blind?""""Wait at the end of the last episode he was about to... How is he... what?""""How do you kill these things? He shot it in its... but wait she shot it in the... wait what? Do you need to destroy the brain or not!? TELL ME!""Now, if you can ignore all the times you'll feel this way, WHICH WILL BE A LOT, it's an okay zombie show. Initially I was worried about teen angst, I don't like teen drama, it's usually boring and revolves around people not saying things that could easily solve 90% of any and all problems. Luckily the show splits its focus from time to time, and we get to see some different groups of people dealing with very different situations. It's a good break from the Teen angst and let's us see glimpses of how the world is reacting to this situation. With that said, there is a lot of teen rubbish in here. I think if this were written a bit better, with less contrivances, and characters I actually cared about, I could've given it a higher score.I think if people are overly positive about this it's probably due to the whole K-pop vibe people are on... Essentially, anything Korean gets a pass due to pop culture favouritism. Whereas, if people are overly negative, it's potentially due to the cliched teen drama, contrivance filled writing and dumb character decisions that they can't overlook for the sake of entertainment.Look, it's no Kingdom. It's no Train to Busan (THE 1ST ONE OMG that second movie was baaaad). But it's an okay watch.Oh, the ending was kinda bad and the final episode dragged. Definitely could've been less episodes.If you're already a zombie fan, you'll find this okay, heck, you may even like it. There's a lot of fake reviews on here, but I think any review scored between a 7 and a 4 can be trusted as coming from an OBJECTIVE reviewer."
5254,All of Us Are Dead,"I've read webtoon ""All of us are dead (Now at our school)"" right after watching the trailer of this show. It wasn't a lengthy comic with a heavy conversation, so it was easy to turn to the next chapters. I'm not a fan of the style of the comic, but it was still fun and intense. I'm in the 5th episode right now, and so far I've felt the show adapted the original webtoon quiet well which is why I wanted to write a review about it. However, I get to see these assumptions of promoting High school of the dead from the comments which is not okay seriously. I also watched High school of the Dead long time ago. All I can remember is that the anime was more about female body images rather than zombies and stuff. Plots and characters in both shows, there's no any similarity between the two. The only similar aspect is they both use high school students as main characters. Honestly, Is there anime that doesn't use high school students as main characters? Seriously, google High school of the dead anime, and watch it on youtube, you'll get the idea within 2 minutes. I would not recommend to watch it with female companions or friends though. Back to the show, All of us are dead, it's well made, and it adopted the original story very well.Update: I ended up watching the whole series for 2 days. It's worth it just as other positive reviewers say. It's well paced, and mixed with good actions. Also it created a different type of zombie."
5255,All of Us Are Dead,"I put off watching this and eventually started the first episode and binged it and finished it as fast I could. I binged squid game in a day but couldn't with this for various reasons, none of it being my lack of interest.It definitely gets some things from train of busan but that isn't bad because that's a great movie itself. I thought 12 episodes was going to be too long but would have liked another episode rather than a subtle hint that could lead to another season. It should end with the last episode.The thing that intrigued me the most is the zombie and the sets and how hard it must have been to put makeup on all of them and dress them accordingly and the effort of rehearsal to get some of these scenes done right. This absolutely deserves many awards. The acting from the kids is meh but everything else is top notch."
5256,All of Us Are Dead,"I enjoy the zombie premise but the characters talk way too much. One group literally spends entire episodes talking and not utilizing their surroundings for survival.A lot of high school drama. But mixed in with a lot of terrible adult storyline and acting. The show lacks focus.Coming off of the walking dead series, this show really focuses on running and not fighting. The constant running and bickering can get tiring."
5257,All of Us Are Dead,"I could only watch 1 1/2 episodes, there is just too much bullying going on. I wanted to watch a show about zombies, and I got a show about mean kids, another Korean show I'm watching has some focus on bullying also, but that's not the main focus. I have to ask, Is the entirety of Korean high schools filled with nothing but bullies and victims? I suppose if you can get past the almost constant bullying you might get to the part with the zombies, I gave up this just turned me off."
5258,All of Us Are Dead,"People are flying out windows, others being attacked all over the school, yet half the school is carrying on as if nothing is happening. And teen love stories galore NAUSEATING."
5259,All of Us Are Dead,"...watching someone turn into a zombie before they take action? You take action before they get off the floor and try to bite you. It can be forgiven the first time (maybe even the second time), but every time? And it seems all the kids know zombie lore (one of them even mentions Train to Busan), yet don't act accordingly to defend themselves?I've been watching a lot of Korean shows, and there's a trend where people don't do the right thing so they don't embarrass themselves or the job. And everyone always seems to be up for a job review, and it's better to let people die rather than speak up to avoid a negative review. Is it a narrative staple in Korea, or is that actually the culture (like the incessant crying in Korean tv and movies)?I'll still watch the shows because they're still a hell of a lot better than the American crap."
5260,All of Us Are Dead,"Holy WOW! This show blew me away by excellent production quality especially the zombies, amazing young talented actors, and excellent storyline with depth not just senseless zombie flick.Honestly I never thought that after Walking Dead's massive let down I would ever enjoy a Zombie flick but this show just took it to whole new level. It had everything you need, a great storyline from start to finish, excellent mind boggling graphics, excellent cast, emotion, gore, cringe, and edge of your seat scenes, adrenaline and more.Wow. Hollywood needs to wake up and take lessons from Korean shows! They are just on another level! I really hope there's a Season 2 for this show. I am totally hooked!"
5261,All of Us Are Dead,"The show doesn't pretend to be intellectual or sophisticated. It is straight up what a good classic zombie drama should be- packed with heart-thumbing action throughout, characters that one can relate to and despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and some really emotional & heartbreaking moments towards the end."
5262,All of Us Are Dead,"If you are watching this show only for the gore (like some of the low ratings here), it is not for you.Yes, there are very bloody moments and somewhat unbelievable zombie sequences, but that is a mere fraction of what this show is aiming towards. Under the ""zombies"" and ""fighting"", there is excellent emotional tension and moral exploration. From the students to the officials, the implications of moral judgement are monumental to the progression of the plot. Within the inhumanness, the interactions of such characters entrance us into a somewhat first-hand view of their relationships, where the threats from the ""zombies"" are often side-lined. This led to a truly well rounded series. This is matched with a great musical score, good direction (mostly) and excellent performances all around.There are a few things I didn't like. Firstly, there are many scenes where it feels alot like a soap opera. Characters freeze up way too often, and such moments are quite cliche.Secondly, the girls in this episode, (except one) are extremely sterotypical, and to an extent, useless. Most of them just stand around and whine, sometimes even when the group is being attacked. They after running two steps, they can't get up, they sulk and cry instead of fighting back. I would like to see more women step up and become emotionally and physically strengthened.In general, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling show that often side-lines the blood and gore of a traditional zombie show for a emotionally charged and humane primary plot. It is at times stereotypical and cliché, but it is an excellent binge-watch. I had an excellent time watching it, its topping the Netflix charts, and I would certainly recommend it."
5263,All of Us Are Dead,"Last episode let it down with characters making stupid decisions to go after lost causes and having weak dialog. I think the show could have concluded on the 11th episode and I'd have been happy at that. At the best of times the show was frustrating watching characters bicker with each other in life and death situations or seeing them needlessly sacrifice themselves.Another particularly frustrating thing to see was Nam-Ra only utilise her strength in the last episode when she could have done more in previous episodes to help the group.Also at times it was very convenient how dozens zombies would be chasing characters in one scene, and then in the next scene it wouldn't show how the characters had somehow outran them, the particular scene coming to mind is Onjo's father in the stairwell during the evacuation of the politicians.Some things I really liked: the virus origin story, it was refreshing to see a different take with a zombie virus that could be explained. And with a sad story behind it. I also really enjoyed the setting of most of it taking place in the school. The show was very tense at times, and the setting really added to it.I really liked Park Mi-Jin, her bratty attitude and lines were very funny. And Onjo's father and his undying will to save his daughter really added the sad drama to the show.The show also created some very good characters which you want to see fall, and it delivers on that front as well.Overall while not a perfect show, it is very entertaining and delivers a fresh addition to the zombie genre. Hopefully that is the show done because I wouldn't want to see them make another season."
5264,All of Us Are Dead,"I'll keep it short, the film is action-packed and thrilling - minus the first episode. So you really have to live through the pilot where the writers basically wanted the viewers to get a sense of the show's mood. Honestly, it felt a little unnecessary... Nevertheless, the succeeding episodes were heart-pumping. I didn't want to stop watching at 3 am.Anyway, the problem is not if it lives up to Train to Busan, because of course it won't. Different setting, tone and character focus. But the issue is how the writers only make characters likeable the moment they're about to cut them off.Believe me, I love an emotional character death but to kill of the interesting ones that the audience root for at such an early stage is just annoying. At least semi-develop the other nobodies before killing the charming ones. Other than that, the show's pretty good.I have to comment the casting too. I don't know Korea's standards but WOW everyone's so good. Even the random child saved by the police had great acting skills. So yeah, that made the experience more terrifying.Hoping for season 2. 💪🏻 Give me someone to root for from episode 1 to... at least episode 5-6."
5265,All of Us Are Dead,"This was way better than I thought in the beginning.Surprisingly the kids actors do a great job, sometimes when actors are this young I get bored easily, but this time, it was really hard to watch them go thru some of the hardships they had to face.The half boy zombie is odious to the max, very well written and executed. The half girl zombie too, she did an amazing job of being first a victim, then a killer, props to both actors.The other kids too, great chemistry from such a diverse cast, their differences and similarities are well defined.But, be prepared, anyone can die at any time, don't get too attached to any one character. The mother, the friend, the teacher, anyone can die. Great writers!"
5266,All of Us Are Dead,"Decent show - I will admit reading the other reviews I can kind of understand peoples opinions about the first 2 episodes, they are arguably the weakest, and things really pick up in episode 3 and especially in episode 4. Overall though, it's fun, jumpy, some fun characters and awesome zombie chase scenes. Another solid Korean flick - ignore the haters."
5267,All of Us Are Dead,"This show had me hooked! It was really good, but sadly the ending was just so stupid. Everyone's got their opinion, but I don't understand all the bad ratings. It isn't flawless and it has some inconsistencies about how soon someone ""turns"". And a lot of the characters just stand around being really stupid instead of running or helping their friends, every single time someone starts turning, like they just never learn! But I'm pretty sure every zombie show/movie I ever saw has those same issues. And please watch it in Korean if you can. I only ever watch these foreign shows in their original language which makes them better. The English voice actors for this one are just bad. Real bad. Ruins the show."
5268,All of Us Are Dead,"A nearly perfect zombie series... definitely worth watching...
The rating should be above 8 star
Underrated...
Again proved that korean dramas makers are 🔥🔥 creativity, story, visuals, technicalities, choreography.."
5269,All of Us Are Dead,"All of Us Are Dead is fine.But it is a conceptually very juvenile show. The whole origin of the epidemic is difficult to digest. This series has a certain bizarre tone, that tries to balance the drama, comedy and action-horror, but it doesn't always work. Or it won't work for everyone the same way.Having said this. I had fun. The various points of view on the zombie apocalypse are very well made. Action scenes are great. And the overall production value is pretty decent. There are several characters I liked, and I was sorry to see some of them being dismembered.Despite having some problems with the more childish elements of the narrative, this series, in general, provided me with good times.But it's definitely not as refined as Squid Game. Despite being very ambitious in its proposal.I rate this series 7.5 out of 10."
5270,All of Us Are Dead,"I am enjoying the show. I think Koreans know how to make a zombie movie or a show. I binge watched it entire Saturday and watched 9 episodes in a row. But since I need to sleep, I will watch the rest (3 episodes the next day, Sunday 30th Jan)"
5271,All of Us Are Dead,7.5 is my correct rating. If you are a fan of zombie series this is definitely your cup of time. This series have heavy brutality and violence and everything looks real. The making camera moment all were fantastic.The main defects were the length. 8 episode were have been perfect but they dragged a lot at the end. The other defects were about the zombies. The zombie should be like the usual like in train to bushan but they changed it . Some of the enfected people don't become zombie and thay get super powers . Feels like they copied sweet home.Anyway it is a fun series for zombie fans. The others may not have liked it and don't expect anything like kingdom.
5272,All of Us Are Dead,"If you're a fan of zombie genre then you would find it to be better than most of the existing Zombie based TV series/movies but the concept is predictable. There are few loopholes that are visible to the naked eye but still the production value makes up to it. Some of the characters are too shallow and they could've trimmed it to 10 episodes as 12 episodes felt a bit lengthy. Other than that, it's worth a watch."
5273,All of Us Are Dead,"This was a massively will done show, the stories were good the effects were nice and the goriness was what you'd expect from a good zombie show..
Watch it and enjoy..
Well done 👍"
5274,All of Us Are Dead,"I enjoyed the series. However, what a turnoff seeing attractive Korean girls/women wearing sweatpants underneath their skirts. Whoever embraced that fashion needs mandatory jail time. The Koreans have been putting out some great zombie/infected movies in the past decade."
5275,All of Us Are Dead,"This series isn't bad. It's just a bit frustrating at times. The action and gore is pretty good, and the acting is also good, especially from the zombies. Who are all so realistic and played superbly. My biggest issue is the STUPID decisions that the characters were making. I don't think I've ever shouted at the tv so much in my life. A fun and entertaining watch, if you don't mind not taking it too seriously."
5276,All of Us Are Dead,"Absolutely gripping and thrilling from the start. Fingernail biting scenes and total thrill and tension.An amazing show! Totally love it!Harsh, brutal and gory at times, exactly what you would expect.That's how a zombie series/movie is made. Zac Snyder could watch and learn.Pure awesomeness!If you like the zombie topic, this is for you.Two thumbs up!!"
5277,All of Us Are Dead,"Nice series
its not prefect 10/10
its like 9/10 in my opinion
if u wana a 10/10 korean series?U should watch series likeFlower of evilGoblinCrash Landing on Youmy dangerous wife."
5278,All of Us Are Dead,Who knew that a zombie outbreak would start at a high school in south Korea but I got to say it was full of action and suspense and drama etc I recommend this show to anyone 17+ if they are really mature p.s. Its very graphic.
5279,All of Us Are Dead,There is no coherence whatsoever: zombie turning may go from seconds to several minutes depending on the character. The amount of stupid decisions and unrelatable characters get me siding with the zombies by the 2nd episode. Save yourself from this.
5280,All of Us Are Dead,"I like South Korean movies and series. But what a waste this one, a typical Netflix production. No strong story, directing and not ever once complelling. Too bad SK."
5281,All of Us Are Dead,"This is a great zombie show, the inconsistencies some have complained about between the zombies is explained later as they state the virus is constantly changing and that's why there can be no cure.My biggest issue with this show is that on multiple occasions they use the typical annoying Hollywood scenarios where some character makes a dumb choice and screws things up for everyone.Also it's incredibly hard to watch scenarios like the kid on the roof who decided not to help at all when the rescue chopper comes.Could have been better no doubt, hopefully they'll improve for season 2."
5282,All of Us Are Dead,"The moral of this story? Good guys (people) finish last.I love zombie flicks and South Korea made one of my all-time favorites: you guessed it... Train to Busan. But here they've taken an ENDLESS amount of time with character development, but why? To get us to like the characters so that it stings even worse when they kill them off? Yeah, I know lots of dead characters is to be expected, but they spend 11-ish hours on character development and it just feels like they're torturing us.I'm almost done with the series. I watched it all because currently there was nothing else on Netflix any better. But I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to."
5283,All of Us Are Dead,"This could have been compacted easily into 8 episodes...10 at most. Something's dragged forever and meant nothing.The thing that got me is how, after the long , long time they saw how the zombies worked and then formulated escape plans, these kids would STILL stop and stand around looking at things when it was just time to run. Too dramatic and too stupid.Nice try with some hairy moments; I was glad the punk with the mullet FINALLY got it. He was annoying.Train to Busan was much better, but a good try here."
5284,All of Us Are Dead,"You end up hoping your favourite characters survives and there's some you hope get eaten.Lots of unexpected deaths and you never know who's next.The zombie aspect is done well with good cinematography. There's some truly sad deaths and it's worse when the situation could have been avoided so you feel for the other people.If you want to watch a thrilling zombie movie, with likeable characters and one's you root for to get bit next, you'll like this."
5285,All of Us Are Dead,"Now I like series from Korea better than series from the USA! Why is that?This is certainly not due to the themes, because the Asian filmmakers work through what is also very popular in Hollywood: horror, zombies, violence, coming of age, supernatural powers and so on.But what is the attraction of the films and series from Korea? Above all, that they deal with themselves and their topic without imposing a restrictive corset of rules in advance. In the United States, political correctness now rules all forms of entertainment. Small fringe groups have a stranglehold on the former dream factory and are trying to distort it according to their own moral ideas.Luckily, wokness is not known in Korea and let's hope it stays that way for a long time to come!""Jigeum Uri Hakgyoneun"" rides the wave of success of ""Squid Game"" and shows an entertaining and believable mixture of coming to age and brutal zombie horror.The result is good, albeit with some lengths.The future of good entertainment is no longer in the USA!"
5286,All of Us Are Dead,"Yes, some holes are there in plot but but.They are very very minimal.All the show was done with very good highdrama and action and complete realistic zombie series ever made in entire cinema world.Friendship, Honesty,Love, Survival, right to live was portrayed very well.10/10 rating was very less
i will give 1000/10 .The efforts they had made to make this series is very greatest."
5287,All of Us Are Dead,"I've watched a lot of zombie movies and TV over the years, and I thought All of Us Are Dead was among the best. The action was often incredibly exciting and tense, and the high school students' developing relationships seemed emotionally believable to me. (I mostly watched in Korean with English subs - the English dubbing struck me as weak, causing many dialogue exchanges to sound stilted and overacted.)Also, even when I like an action show where a group of characters is in constant danger, I usually think repeatedly, ""You're such an idiot, you deserve to be killed."" But I can't remember thinking that here. Sometimes the characters make mistakes, but, to me at least, they're realistic mistakes that might actually happen in stressful moments.Anyway, it's the rare new series like this one that keeps me from cancelling Netflix."
5288,All of Us Are Dead,"So we have terrible acting, mainly from the adults, an awful voice over which sounds like something South Park would do, No cliché , trope or stereotype left dragged out, run over then reversed over several times for good measure. Add to this. I have Prosopagnosia, can't recognise faces easily, so pretty much can't tell the characters apart, I genuinely thought one character had been killed off only to see him reappear 2 episodes later talking to the person I though he was.So why is it so good. I keep asking myself that. Give yourself a treat and watch it wont disapoint."

When it reaches a good spot, it freezes in place. A stalk slowly grows from its head. The stalk then spews out spores that spread, turning others into zombies.This is no Halloween story about the zombie apocalypse. It's all true. The zombie isn't a human, though. It's an ant. And the stalk that emerges from its head is a fungus. Its spores infect other ants, which lets the zombie cycle begin anew.In order to grow and spread, this fungus must hijack an ant's brain. However weird this might seem, it isn't all that unusual. The natural world is full of zombies under mind control. Zombie spiders and cockroaches babysit developing wasp larvae - until the babies devour them. Zombie fish flip around and dart toward the surface of the water, seeming to beg for birds to eat them. Zombie crickets, beetles and praying mantises drown themselves in water. Zombie rats are drawn to the smell of the pee of cats that may devour them.All of these ""zombies"" have one thing in common: parasites. A parasite lives inside or on another creature, known as its host. A parasite may be a fungus, a worm or another tiny creature. All parasites eventually weaken or sicken their hosts. Sometimes, the parasite kills or even eats its host. But death of the host isn't the freakiest goal. A parasite might get its host to die in a certain place, or be eaten by a certain creature. In order to accomplish these tricks, some parasites have evolved the ability to hack into the host's brain and influence its behavior in very specific ways.How do parasites turn insects and other animals into the walking almost-dead? Every parasite has its own method, but the process usually involves altering chemicals within the victim's brain. Researchers are working hard to identify which chemicals are involved and how they end up so bizarrely altering their host's behavior.Brains, brains! Ant brains!A fungus doesn't have a brain. And worms and single-celled critters obviously aren't very smart. Yet somehow they still control the brains of larger, and smarter, animals.""It blows my mind,"" says Kelly Weinersmith. She is a biologist who studies parasites at Rice University in Houston, Texas. She is particularly interested in ""zombie"" creatures. True zombies, she points out, aren't exactly like the type you find in horror stories. ""In no way are these animals coming back from the dead,"" she says. Most real zombies are doomed to die - and some have very little control over their actions.The horsehair worm, for instance, needs to emerge in water. To make this happen, it forces its insect host to leap into a lake or swimming pool. Often, the host drowns.Toxoplasma gondii (TOX-oh-PLAZ-ma GON-dee-eye) is a single-celled creature that can only complete its life cycle inside a cat. But first, this parasite must live for a time in a different animal, such as a rat. To ensure this part-time host gets eaten by a cat, the parasite turns rats into cat-loving zombies.In Thailand, a species of fungus - Ophiocordyceps - can force an ant to climb almost exactly 20 centimeters (about 8 inches) up a plant, to face north and then to bite down on a leaf. And it makes the ant do this when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. This provides ideal conditions for the fungus to grow and release its spores.Biologist Charissa de Bekker wants to better understand how that fungus exerts that mind control over the ants. So she and her team have been studying a species related to the Ophiocordyceps fungus in Thailand. This U. S. cousin is a fungus native to South Carolina. It, too, forces ants to leave their colonies and climb. These ants, though, bite down on twigs instead of leaves. This is likely due to the fact that trees and plants in this state lose their leaves in the winter.De Bekker began these studies at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. There, her team infected a few species of ant with the South Carolina fungus. The parasite could kill all of the different ants she introduced to it. But the fungus made plant-climbing zombies only out of the species that it naturally infects in the wild.To figure out what was going on, de Bekker's team collected new, uninfected ants of each species. Then, the researchers removed the insects' brains. ""You use forceps and a microscope,"" she says. ""It's sort of like that game Operation.""The researchers kept the ant brains alive in small Petri dishes. When the fungus was exposed to its favorite brains (that is, ones from the ants that it naturally infects in the wild), it released thousands of chemicals. Many of these chemicals were completely new to science. The fungus also released chemicals when exposed to unfamiliar brains. These chemicals, however, were completely different. The researchers published their results in 2014.The experiments at Penn State by de Bekker's team were the first to create ant zombies in the lab. And the researchers only succeeded after setting up artificial 24-hour cycles of light and darkness for the zombies and their parasites.It will take more work to learn how the parasite's chemicals lead to zombie behavior in ants. ""We are very much in the beginning of trying to figure this out,"" says de Bekker. She now studies ant zombies at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. There, she is now probing how that daily cycle of sunlight and darkness affects zombification."
5290,All of Us Are Dead,"While I enjoyed shows like squid game and alot of anime you can't get away from the strangest of characters from All of us are Dead, every character is directed to overact their role, from bullies being completely evil, to victims being evil eventually tarring the whole school in revenge, none are really phased with killing & then of course in traditional Korean fashion there's the ridiculous stab at humour, heart felt moments but if they're crying missing loved ones, by the next scene they're making toilet humour, it's too un-human to be a classic, it's confused and tries to achieve everything but eventually achieves an average rating at best, another overly marketed show that suffers from overhype."
5291,All of Us Are Dead,I loved this series a thrilling ride to start to finish. I was gripped and loved the characters. The Koreans really are at the top of their game. Hollywood watch out.
5292,All of Us Are Dead,"I really enjoyed this, and whilst it was obviously about a Zombie outbreak it felt much, much more, with characters I actually cared about.Some comments have said it's just the same as all other S Korean zombie films. Perhaps. But the physicality and action within the school were still ten times better than some of the stuff churned out in the US or Europe.It didn't shirk away from violence and wasn't afraid to kill off key characters - although you could argue it was a bit too keen at times. Maybe some of the side stories didn't really go anywhere, but they at least broke up the main focus so it didn't become too claustrophobic in one location, and even then you felt the whole of the school was utilised to give it a sense of scale.Things I liked:Good charactersGood set pieces and effectsGenuine interest in where the story was goingMain quibbles:The origin story of the virus was a bit ridiculousIs it realistic that the infected would just stay within that specific area and it wouldn't spread further?Apart from the school why are there never zombie children in the streets? (Something in all films to be fair)Probably could have been trimmed down to 10 episodes max.Overall, I thought this was just as good as Squid Game and, in some instances, better."
5293,All of Us Are Dead,"I avoid trailers nowadays, I check the description, who is in it and who made it and that seems to work for me. I really enjoyed this series, binged with my wife. If ur looking for a good zombie horror action with some kdrama and kquirks this is really good, just note the 1st episode sets up the show so it's abit slow."
5294,All of Us Are Dead,"Despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and you could really feel their emotions as they make their ways through the endless waves of zombie attacks, dealing with the sadness of losing their friends/loved ones and struggling to stay hopeful in the wake of such dire circumstances.Overall, it was a genuinely enjoyable zombie thriller where you will feel the excitement, laugh and cry together with the students as they fight for survival!"
5295,All of Us Are Dead,"Who doesn't love South Korean zombie productions, 'uh?This one has a cool overall concept, good visuals and a great atmosphere, with some great action scenes, especially some of the chase scenes with the students...... however, it also has severe flaws that nearly ruin the enjoyment.The pacing is horrible, especially in the first half of the show. The show goes to a crawl in some of the initial episodes. Extremely slow episodes with 1h10 run time is crazy. It also completely goes overboard with the clickity-clack loud sounds on the transformations earlier on, too many, too often, too frequently for too long.I won't go into stupid character decisions as plot devices, or the absurd emotional philosophical talks whilst zombies are about to overrun you, or the fact they repeat the 'person transforming into zombie in front of you and everyone watches eagerly' 3 or 4 times in the first episodes, since it's part of a typical zombie show, those are all 'acceptable' as is.Had this show been properly edited, or cut, with a lower, but more relevant run time, and it would have been a sensational hit. As it is, its actually tough to tolerate the bad, to enjoy the good.I liked the cast, most of them did ok, and hope to see some of them in future shows."
5296,All of Us Are Dead,"Usually, Korean series are watchable 6s or 7s. This one is not. An amateurish, sloppy and unintelligent string of nonsensical clichés that goes on and on and on ... sheer smother.Redeeming value? Stunt scenes are pretty great, hence 4 stars."
5297,All of Us Are Dead,"This zombie show definitely has its faults. I was constantly irked or shaking my head or rolling my eyes. Still for everything it does wrong, it does ten other things so right. Above all else, its just plain too fun to hate. I mean its also sad and scary and bloody and all that stuff, but most of all its just fun. Also its very interesting as an American to see some of the sensibilities of youth in Koreas culture. Very different. I need another season right away. So addictive. No matter how silly some of it got, I kept coming back for the characters even though I disliked almost all of them. Very well fleshed out characters. That helps you care about and understand the stakes more. I liked Squid game but this is better definitely."
5298,All of Us Are Dead,"Well, as a Netflix production, this is way better than this piece of garbage that is Squid Game, (probably because it is based on a webtoon, so they already had the origin material) but I would not call it best tv series of 2022!The characters lack a bit of personality and charisma, and there's unecessary teenage drama too. Most of the characters and events are predictable, there's no surprises.Still, it is a decent show to watch, but I had to fast forward lot of boring stuff.There are way better Korean TV series out there! (Taxi driver, Signal, Hapiness, Sweet Home, Strangers from Hell, Uncanny Counter, Mouse etc...)"
5299,All of Us Are Dead,"It's the first zombie series that I've watched with sufficient amount of time given to explanations about the causes, govt reactions and research. Add to that an effort for the character building, two types of zombies as well as interesting ending.This series is quite unique in that sense, and that's why I am giving it an 8.What I didnt like is generally seen in almost all Korean movies and series: too long stares between actors, their slow reactions, aggresive behaviour of women which are hitting guys all the time for no reason. The way Korean girls run is always clumsy with their hands down. Girls always yell on guys for no reason, they never yell on them etc.There are also some unreasonable things that bothered me, like not looking for food, water nor toilet in days.But all in all, i would recommend this movie to those who specifically like this genre as there are some unique and never-seen before ideas. Hopefully producers of other future zombie movies will pay attention and develop on that, as zombie genre really needs this kind of refreshment, to move away from boring and simplified 'chase and kill' action."
5300,All of Us Are Dead,"It's a good show. Sometimes too long. Could have been shorter at about 8 episodes. I found myself just forwarding lot of moments and during that nothing happened. Just people watching into each other eyes. And that's a lot of minutes. Sometimes, i questioned a lot of decisions. But reminded myself these are just a bunch of kids who are supposed to be 15-17 years old. In addition, this is happening in an Asian society so a lot of decision makings are just different from kids who are in a western country.The Character developments are okay. We see different types so it'll be easy for people to recognize themselves in the kids.Some comedic moments are added to the show to lighten it. Some scenes are just gore.The ending leaves space for a part 2.Overall it's a good show to watch. Not perfect. But good."
5301,All of Us Are Dead,"Going into it i was really not sceptical as the series was 12 episodes (each episode having 45+ runtime), and the series does lag in the middle but at the end its a good series. Acting is not bad , zombies are part we seen before and part new things. Worth a watch go for it if you have time. After watching this i really miss the series named ' Sweet Home ' which i hope Netflix renews for a new season ."
5302,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm very happy to see this have high reviews. I clapped once it finished and thanked the screen. Just all around great. Character development, check. Zombie filled stressful moments, check. I thought it was very neat to have most of it in happen within one location, and all the creative ways these kids, together, stayed alive. It's almost believable and realistic on what it would look like. Explored grief and relationships in a beautiful way. It was longgg, it never seemed too long and the length served the snow. Loved going on this journey with these heroes :)"
5303,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm about half-way through the season. The show has some flaws, it's not perfect. Nothing is. Expecting this to be a flawless masterpiece is unrealistic and just being an entitled a&&hole.But really, this is a great entry into the zombie canon so far. I think they are doing some really creative things and trying to have some fun at the same time. The pacing is good, the soundtrack is good. They're thinking big-picture about some of the problems that would be encountered and totally Train to Busan-ing ways to solve those problems.Yes, characters sometimes make stupid decision. But honestly, is it realistic for high school kids in ""real life"" to suddenly become apocalypse masterminds as soon as zombies prove to be real and start attacking? Would it be realistic for everyone, even adults, to know the perfect strategy and what to do every time in an intense situation like this? C'mon. Gimme a break.Of course they're not always going to do the smart thing. That's called being a teenager. That's called being HUMAN.This show is taking a balls-to-the-wall stab at doing some fresh with the genre while still respecting the canon that's come before. It's fun to watch. It's also got emotional depth and some real to say under it all.Watch it, eat some popcorn."
5304,All of Us Are Dead,Did you expect some kind of new twist on Zombies? Did you expect the stupidity of Zombie of the dead? Its bloody and violent. Its everything you want in a zombie show. Stop complaining and expecting originality in a world where there is none. Just enjoy it.
5305,All of Us Are Dead,"Ok, it's not the 'Train to Busan stopping first at high school' that I had hoped it would be but I quite enjoyed it. It might benefit from there being a bit of a lull in good stuff being released right now though(?).It basically follows the progress of a couple of groups of kids (most focus being on the the one, larger group) as they try to escape the zombie infested high school.Along the way, stuff happens - some more interesting than others, some of it is really quite stupid and there are times when I felt like switching off but am glad I didn't. The first episode or two in particular are a bit... iffy...Watch it expecting a Young Adult horror series and you'll enjoy it more than if you go into it expecting it to be outright horror."
5306,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm halfway through episode 2 and over it. I enjoy a good zombie movie, but I'm tired of watching the same boring tropes. I was really hoping this could be different, but alas, it's all the same. Good production value can't overcome horrible scriptwriting, plot holes, and annoying characters. I'm sure this is a teenager's wet dream, but I can already feel my brain cells screaming in agony.What's with the bone cracking?? The inconsistent turn rates? There are students running around outside, yet no one thinks to run out of the school gates? We watch one short scene with the principal and that's it... wtf happened to the staff? Does this school not own an office with phones? Don't the classrooms have phones?? Where are the police? In the ""real world,"" rational people are fighting to survive- not mooning over their crush, calling each other ""c*$ksucker"" (that gem came from a teacher to a student), or standing around wondering HOW to kill these things when ""Train to Busan"" is clearly referenced several times.I literally cannot fathom sitting through 10 more hours of this, especially if the origin story is of Dad of the Year injecting his bullied son with a homemade recipe for revenge. What a disappointment- for once I'd love to see a total overhaul of the genre. I'm reminded of how I felt seeing the Matrix back in 99... it was new and exciting. I havent watched ""Train to Busan"" yet, but hope that it will restore some faith in zombies again."
5307,All of Us Are Dead,Its an averge teen zombie series the only thing special about this one is the action scene in 1st and 2nd episode its filming really well .. after that is gets bad .............
5308,All of Us Are Dead,"I won't write too much about this drama. The acting is decent. The script is OK - if you're watching with English dub, and the direction and editing are worthy of note but, at the end of the day, this is just another example of a production attempting to instill the idea that humans are violent.Episode 4 spells it out, without trying to hide it.Humans are inherently bad, so life without a governing body is wrought with danger.Whatever happened to the idea - possibly born in the 60's, or earlier - that humanity is inherently good?There are only a very small minority who find satisfaction in causing harm to the rest. Most humans would rather love their neighbour, not hate.Good idea for a show, if you're not bored with zombies, but we should all long for the day when writers realise that the public are not idiots, who fall for the idea that every human has evil at heart. Or is this just an attempt to make every human evil, whether they intend to be or not?It isn't just Hollyweird trying this approach, apparently.Try harder, Korea. You may find social realism - i.e. Actual social realism - more rewarding for the audience."
5309,All of Us Are Dead,"With any zombie movie or drama, you accept the basic premise of a fictious life form that does things that are unreal. However, it does get frustrating when the show is filled with unrealistic human behavior. The zombie outbreak at the school starts with a girl opening a cage that was rattling. I had a sense of deja vu since another zombie show, Kingdom, had two people fighting to the death, but stopping suddenly to open a rattling crate, which let out the... zombie... Are there that many people in this world who cannot resist opening something that rattles? Please, please... If you hear suspicious rattling from a box or crate, call the authorities or move away from it. Do NOT open the damn box!!!"
5310,All of Us Are Dead,"Recently South-Korea seems to be on a zombie streak. This has come with some great hits (Train to Busan and Kingdom) and some terrible misses. Unfortunately this show is more miss than hit.The first half of the show holds its own, as character deaths are swift and believable. The engine is chugging with proper tension, low on melodramatic scenes.Unfortunately the second half of the show, especially after the reveal of the halfbies, is rife with melodramatic scenes and long drawn out shots trying desperately to make the viewer sad. Very cheap tactics are used multiple times. (Parents of girl X die, mother of boy Y dies, and father of girl Z dies.)Another disappointment is the asymptomatic angle. It is never explored further than to find a tactic to lure zombies with high pitch noise. The last we see of the second halfbie is the lab being wiped clean.Initially I thought the halfbie angle could be interesting but it is never properly explored, except to serve us a recurring 80's Hollywood enemy. In the end I think they should have toned down the halfbie angle and gone with a more interesting approach of how to deal with asymptomatic carriers. It had a lot of potential.Unfortunately a lot of potential was wasted and there's no coming back from these choices in a potential season 2. I'll be waiting for the next season of Kingdom.4/10."
5311,All of Us Are Dead,Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead. Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.
5312,All of Us Are Dead,"Perfect? No, but def worth a watch, kinda addfictive.Zombies are very cool and scary, feel like Train to Busan zombies. I really don't understand why some people complain about them.Characters: they are many of them, some are more likable than others. What is nice is we never know who will die or not ; sometime a character got a big story but then die right after, sometime a ''secondary'' character (at first) will become important. So it's stressful when they are under attack, because we really don't know who will survive. Yea sometime they die in some weird/dumb way, but it would happen in a real zombie invasion. It's not alway super cool and heroic in my opinion.I don't agree when people complain that some characters just stand here and don't move. It's possible to be shocked when your best friend or dad or mom turn into a zombie. Not sure if you would do better, really.Perhap a bit too much teen drama for my taste, I was a bit annoyed at episode 7-8-9, but it's ok. I kind of agree that the serie could have been like 10 epiodes instead of 12.Not a fan of the pseudo intellectual jaded ideas of ''humanity is evil, bad so they deserve it'' and stuff.A good 8/10 for sure, try it."
5313,All of Us Are Dead,Only on episode 3 and already hooked this is brilliant.Everything is so good about this show. Its so freaking scary love it!This show is so good that anyone who likes horror should watch it.
5314,All of Us Are Dead,"The show is intense but still has humor. Not as dark as the Kingdom, but intense enough for a zombie show. I think it is the only zombie show that looks so much into the humanity and relationship, and social problems. So in that sense, it is quite soft, not as hardcore as the Kingdom."
5315,All of Us Are Dead,"I really enjoyed this for the most part - there's a lot of originality in a theme that's been done a lot, the acting was often good, the action sequences amazing, but then there'll be a really crap line, or some insanely dumb decision that makes you cringe.I'd probably have rated it a little lower for those negatives, but hey, I live in the UK, so I'm well aware how dumb some decisions can be in real life, so they're not unrealistic, just a bit annoying."
5316,All of Us Are Dead,"Not sure how this got 7.7.It's not ""that bad"" but it's also not very good either. Everything gets very repetitive and/or very ridiculous VERY quickly, and this is someone that stuck with the dumpster fire TWD until the end.This review is totally ignoring how the writers chose at PURE WILL to FIT THEIR MEDIOCRE scripts just how long it takes to turn into a zombie after being bitten. 5 seconds? Yeah sure, if it fits the script. 5 minutes? Yeah sure, if it fits the script and the person bitten needs to give an emotional goodbye,Not a terrible show, not a very good one either."
5317,All of Us Are Dead,"Boring stuff and lame stories don't get better if you produce them in South Korea! Mix some Teenage highscool crap stories with a virus and let them all get zombies. Zzz! The story is told a thousand times the last 10 years in roundabout a 100 zombie series. Why stupid humans need another one? I am really sick and tired of Netflix. They are so predictable. Show one series out of South Korea, see that it is successful, buy a thousand lame series more from South-Korea and hope they get hyped the same way. Nope thats not how it goes!"
5318,All of Us Are Dead,"My expectation for the show was higher than what it turned out to be. The storyline was good, however, felt like it way too stretched that it should've been. The reason to create that virus that made the people zombie was that satisfactory. This shows the cruelty the victims face from the people they expect to aid them. The romance they tried to create in this show was not something appreciative at all. As the romance was not even a bit exciting all along the show. You can watch it if you have time it's a mid tier apocalyptic show.The ending was a cliffhanger and it was a nice exciting one hopefully they can bring out the next season and make it a good one. However, my expectations are not that high as I don't think there can be something more added to make the story better."
5319,All of Us Are Dead,"I stopped watching american zombie dramas and their other dramas, since they always include unnecessary adult scenes, sxx, etc. So happy i found korean dramas.I would give a 10 if only cheong san ending is different. This young actor is very good. They better bring him back in season 2.However other than that, the drama dan the ending is very satisfying."
5320,All of Us Are Dead,"I like how Korean filmmakers always give fresh ideas. Since the era of Train to Busan, Korean zombie-themed shows, although not very developed, at least show new situations like this series. There may have been many teenage romance dramas at school, but you may not have found teenage romance dramas at school in the mid of a zombie outbreak situation before this series."
5321,All of Us Are Dead,"Very entertaining, the cinematography is pretty good and there were a lot of nice shots
The plot is very interesting, for once the main characters are not adults but young students so it was nice seeing a different point of view.Amazing the relationship between the characters, even if it is a series about survival and zombies it goes deep in the emotions of the characters, hope they'll make a second season cause I'd like to see more of them."
5322,All of Us Are Dead,"To be honest I was not really interested about starting a series about zombies, the entire concept has been so dragged out that it starts feeling stale. There always are exceptions with ridiculously funny Zombieland and masterfully directed Train to Busan( which is by far my favourite zombie movie).For a series the 1 hour mark was daunting for me as an hour is almost half the runtime of a movie. But after the 1st episode I was hooked so if you are scared of the runtime don't worry if you finish the 1st episode you'll want to watch the next and then next. It however feels like a commitment.The story as we can except from a kdrama was top notch, except the ending. The motivation was spot on for the development of the zombie virus( not a spoiler as that's how it's). Though the science behind it I'm a little iffy about it, however emotionally it made sense. The friendships throughout the series were so good like there was a rollercoaster of emotions involved. An irritating villain who just keeps coming back. The heartlessness of people we have to depend upon, and the will to survive. I wanna make a special note that the romance is so adorable and beautiful that you want to protect all of the ships but the world it's set-up is so cruel that you end up broken anyways. Which brings me to the ending, as the show came to a close certain deaths seemed like they just happened to be killed to attain a certain route without any development which made those deaths cheap. Also after such a harrowing experience, you'd expect a good/wholesome ending but even that was stripped from us, so basically PAIN + PAIN.Characters were amazingly written. Like always whenever a zombie movie starts you bey on who's gonna survive, I did that too. Most of my guesses were right but I was surprised to see which one of them. As i have said you'll feel the beautiful friendships, you'll feel the romance which then will intensify the pain. Although certain characters were so useless that they just randomly died and no one from the cast seemed to care later. I found it funny and as a glitch as all the characters were saying they gotta be like a family. So that's a negative. Some moves weren't very logical and I should expect that with zombie movies but when other aspects are so good you end up expecting more. Like there's a scene where a laptop is supposed to be procured it was alright but it had unnecessary tension build up. After that scene we got into the human emotions stuff and that made me forget that scene. But still.Sound design is very well. The way background music can convert a scene from terrifying in a moment to comedy is pretty good. Music plays amazing role in the emotions that we see on screen. Romance, comedy, horror, friendship, sadness, despair everything.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to watch this series, it took me about 2 days to finish it but you can finish it in one. The end is unsatisfactory but you'll still enjoy it. Hope a sequel is released ( which probably will not since it's a Korean series which are mostly limited).Thanks for reading. See you later✌"
5323,All of Us Are Dead,"Just finished watching this series and wow.I love Korean products that talk about zombies, this amazed me, it was a mix of emotions. I laughed, cried, screamed, felt sorry for the characters, got upset about some adult choices, and empathized totally with them.I find it a fantastic product, the relationships between people and the reactions they have really amazed me.I hope a sequel comes out, I want to see them again."
5324,All of Us Are Dead,"Those korean kids acts like they have some kind of retardation themselves. It is too far from reality. I know, zombies are far as well, however it is about them before turning into zombies. My god, they do absurd things, when they are trying too much scaping from zombies is ridiculous, they go out the building go back inside, no one even tries to scape from there.The drama itself do not convincing anyone. What I observed: they are smarter when they get infected, what is hilarious, I do not know how young Koreans are actualy, but if they are like that then South Korea has dark times upcoming. The scenes, their decisions, everything is a lame in this terrible series. I think if there is some screenwriter that is an idiot, ok. But there are: producers, directors and actors themselves. How, in this world that could be convincible? HOW in this world? I fear that from few years ago to the future, the cinema is not an art anymore it is just a bunch of crazy inflated egos trying to do over and over the samep s..t."
5325,All of Us Are Dead,"I'd love to give this series an 8 or more. It had potential. Unfortunately, nearly every decision the characters make is beyond stupid. They all deserve to die. And multiple people should be fired... director, producers, writers."
5326,All of Us Are Dead,"Stupid character decisions ruin shows. In this one for example they all know what zombies are and they even reference Train to Busan. So why on earth wouldn't they try to armour themselves up, like wrap their arms and legs with books, get some sharp objects as weapons, stop yelling unnecessarily, stop trying to prevent people from killing bitten people etc.Nam-ra's character was annoying and I don't know why they made her the focus. The dads plotline was also pointless.There's many storylines that were unnecessary or frustrating like the bully that kept falling from the building. The zombie human girl should havr also been going around and stabbing all the zombies one by one and clearing out areas before the rest moved out. Missed opportunity and they didn't have the best strategies. That final zombie battle out in the open with spades was also super ridiculous and stupid decision making. The writers should have made them at least take high ground.Oh yeah also why wouldn't the archery students be collecting their arrows as much as possible. They need all the arrows they can get. They would have used the arrows and gone around stabbing the zombies one by one through the tennis cage or something like that. Like daryl did in the walking dead. So many missed opportunities that zombie lovers would have wanted to see."
5327,All of Us Are Dead,"3 episodes in and I'm waiting to give a crap about any of these characters. None of them are likeable, or particularly smart or clever. The perfect show to watch while on your phone."
5328,All of Us Are Dead,"Happiness (2021) is also a Zombie Kdrama, except it's not. It focuses on the human aspect of survival in a way to try and present itself as unique. It tries to show us that humans are worse than zombies, except the writing is absolute garbage because the basis of each episode is a character making a dumb decision and then the two main protagonists having to fix that dumb decision. That is not how you create plot! That show falls into every zombie pitfall trope possible.Now All os Us are dead on the other hand is amazing. If you want to see how cruel humans can actually be to one another, this is the show, especially after episode 3. Good cast of characters, great action, great plot, great sfx makeup and average cinematography. However if you're watching this show for film making techniques you've come to the wrong place."
5329,All of Us Are Dead,"South Korea has disappointed us. I do not know if this is called a comedy or horror series or thriller but whatever it is, it is a disaster. Destruction."
5330,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm not sure what people who are calling this mediocre are talking about..the writing and production were on target, and the acting was great. I liked the ending. Definitely recommend."
5331,All of Us Are Dead,"Definitely a big series. 12 episodes with 1 hour each = 12 hours of time.....
I did it split it into 3 days to see and eventually it was released during the weekend.As usual Zombie base concept but the modus operandi of the point of creation was different. The concious Zombie concept which is an inspiration from ""Zack Snyders - The Army of the Dead"". This consious Zombies are really a different kind in the script and does create good value to the usual story.The names were really tough to go through atleast for the 5 or 6 episodes and after several deaths, I can remember the last batch of 8 names. Just for fun - Nam Ra, Haeyuk, Chiang, Yong Sue and many moreeeeeee...There was more fun involved as well like the youtuber,the policman and the leg injured guy.The deaths of the well developed characters are expected always - that will be the weseries trend for the past years.The ending again leaves lead to part two and as usual I do wait for the nexr season. But I hardly wish 40 mins * 6/8 episodes with a gripping play - definetely dont want 12 hours of running time."
5332,All of Us Are Dead,"One of the recent Korean productions quickly positioned itself among the most popular in Mexico. I already know why. It starts as ""Zombie Station"" (also Korean) and ends as ""RBD"" (typical Mexican teen drama soap opera).What a big disappointment and what a waste of time after chapter 2!The pace of the script is truly stressful, something that should be caused by the zombie chases and the inevitable spread of the virus.The characters live between regrets, like teenagers, but even adults behave as if they were incapable of having developed emotional intelligence. So many tears distract them from the need to strategize, strengthen alliances, and basically run away instead of mindlessly fighting monsters.It is not a dystopian world, they well know that zombies die with the destruction of the brain and go to war like cavemen with stones and sticks.Something that really bothers me is the denial of science, from the fact that a resentful teacher can create a virus in his room without the rigor of a laboratory, to the lack of contagion patterns... some of them reach superpowers and others simply run to bite whoever they catch.The story provokes in the viewer the constant desire that everyone die for idiots! They all deserve to die.Netflix invested a lot of money in digital production and post-production, they would have paid better writers instead.In other hand, it is a good portrait of school violence. Many of the problems that occur in history are rooted in abuses of power, bad influences, and inequities between social classes. There are many examples of social degradation, such as ""Lord of the Flies"" or ""The Beach"".It started with five stars but in the end it only deserves three."
5333,All of Us Are Dead,"I can't believe how good this series turned out to be.I love zombie movies/series but in recent years, my standards got to a very low level, as there were not many good contents in this type.All of Us Are Dead proved, that if they want, they can absolutely put together a show full of excitement.It was fast paced, exciting and emotional from the beginning til the end. If you are a zombie fanatic, you definitely should watch this.Sure, there were some mistakes and errors, but which undead movie doesn't?"
5334,All of Us Are Dead,"The series wasn't toooo bad but it could've been done in eight parts instead of twelve. At the midpoint it started dragging on way too much first with the group assembling in the choir room lamenting and arguing, then the roof for two episodes, lamenting and arguing, then we got a little action as they moved from the roof to the closet in the gym, and we had to spend time with them crying, lamenting and arguing some more for an episode and a half. Looord snooze fest. As diverse and fleshed out as the main characters were they weren't all that likable or interesting. I loved when they shared a candy bar in the closet as if they hadn't eaten in weeks when only 24 hours had gone by since the infection started.Then the one antagonist kept getting pushed out windows and pushed off the roof and then he kept coming back so that plot point got a little stale. I think if I had zombie superpowers the last thing I would care about is my missing eye and getting revenge for it. After all, his body was crunched, twisted, bit, smashed, mashed... he looked like hell so why was he worried about his eye for?I think this would've been a lot better if they had only trimmed the melodramatic repetitive fat and kept it to six episodes.Anywho..."
5335,All of Us Are Dead,"'All of us are dead' is the latest Korean sitting on top in Netflix shows which have been dominated by Koreans for a couple of months in most countries. Whether you are familiar with K-drama or you are just getting to know about it after the #squidgame pandemic and giving it a chance just like me, this show has so much to tell. The plot is not perfect and has a lot of holes in it that some of it will be probably answered in next season, however, for someone with a lot of Zombie movies, shows, and games experience, the characters seemed a bit stupid at the start, some of the deaths are badly written. But when you stop comparing them to let's say badass characters of other shows like #Thewalkingdead, they seem a lot more realistic. So bear that in mind that these characters are just a bunch of high school kids with no experience or proper weapon at hand. The story starts with a virus outbreak in a high school and covers a lot of different characters without a leading role. With all the explanations 'All of us are dead' has a messy but proper and thrilling plot. The casting is good. I believe that most of the actors & actresses are new faces but they did the job quite well. CG and computer effects are good mostly but in a few scenes, it's not very clean. The soundtracks and sound effects are good and it brings a sense of fear to the show. The opening is one of the positive points and it's innovative.Overall, 'all of us are dead' is a brutal and thrilling zombie show with an acceptable plot and good choice of cast. If you are looking for a fun zombie show that tastes like K-drama, it can be a good choice for you."
5336,All of Us Are Dead,"This show brings absolutely nothing new to the zombie genre and falls for all the same pitfalls zombie movies from 2002 fell for.Zombies in drama teenage school with a little bit of bullying undertone but nothing ever feels like a _complete story_.It's just a string of events and 1 dimensional comic book-like characters who serve exactly one purpose: the sad girl, the maniac bully, the fat kids who loves chicken. It's almost satire.Entertaining background noise but I can't help to think - was this conjured by an AI?"
5337,All of Us Are Dead,"Is this a great zombie outbreak show? Yes. Is it plauged by the occasional cheesy comic relief cliches at points? Also Yes. But this show goes so much further than that. In the end it's less about the zombies and more about the horrific trauma the outbreak inflicts on everyone involved. It shows the perspective of survivors as well as rescuers and military. No one is spared from the effects of this nightmare and nothing is black and white. It's honestly tough to watch at times and nauseating to see what these people have to go through, but it's refreshing in the sense that it isn't just a mindless hack and slash zombie flick and actually deals with tragedy as well as moral and ethical dilemmas. Highly Recommend."
5338,All of Us Are Dead,My family and I really enjoyed this show. It was good from start to finish! Better than stupid Walking Dead that dragged on for years. Make a good series and know when to end it.
5339,All of Us Are Dead,Started promising but I would have switched off after episode 4 if it wasn't for my partner who wanted to finish it.Turns out we needn't have bothered. There must have been 3-4 episodes where nothing happens and they just move about from room to room making the same mistakes. Infuriating.Zero payoff at the end too.
5340,All of Us Are Dead,"Good premises of a zombie apocalypse setup. Generally good acting but the whole coming-of-age mixed in really dragged down the show.It's zombie apocalypse we do not have time for young brats' love quarrel and other emotional stupidity. Many parts we fast-forwaded to skip the boring cheesy moment that are suppose to be emotional. They felt completely out of place. Lot of sub-plots were not done in enough details and felt like just fillers.And I meant it is a zombie apocalypse show we are not expecting it to be 100% realistic, but when you have the main casts happily chatting with each other after two-three days of no water and food, zombies suddenly chase flare for no reason, and certain roles took forever to fully turn into zombie after being bitten, you know something is wrong about the script."
5341,All of Us Are Dead,"I liked Train to Busan so when they said that a new Korean zombie show was coming out I was really excited. The trailer looked good and I'm for TV series over movies to tell a big story all day any day. I thought it was cool that they had some scientific explanations for the zombie outbreak and not just ""it started"". It was also cool to have 12 hours to cover surviving a zombie apocalypse rather than 2 in a movie. But the show really fell flat.For starters, the plot was really ridiculous at times. The virus origin story was just ""what""? So the teacher's son was bullied, and instead of protecting him, moving him to another school, finding ways to prove the bullies' guilt, using his status as a teacher to push for punishment, signing him up for self defense classes and basically everything rational... he injects his son with a new virus he just created? I'm impressed he was able to contain his son and wife at home without getting hurt himself btw. Then when the virus broke out his actions were really inconsistent. He was agitated at first when finding out that the student he chained up was released. But then he took centuries to explain everything. Also he sent the cop to his computer to retrieve the solution when it was just ""burn them all""? I was really hoping this character would be developed and utilized more, since the scientific side of a zombie virus is pretty interesting and would've separated this series from other zombie shows.Moving on, the characters that we follow are mostly not very likable. There were some actors that were horendous at acting too. Zombie in your face and these kids just poker face... I get that these kids are just teenagers, but it's a zombie apocalypse, one of the kids actually mentioned Train to Busan in episode 1 or sth, lets get to work with building up defenses, armoring up, finding resources, figuring out what's going on outside... can we save the meaningless squabbles and love triangle drama for later? The kids also act very dumb at times. Can we throw an infected person out of the room before they actually become a zombie and get another person bitten? Yes I can imagine it being tough when it's a friend or family, but sometimes they really go over the top with it and just makes the characters seem stupid and irrational. Neither the protagonists nor the antagonists were particularly well written, and I can't help feeling that the writer had something against women in general. I get that Asia's gender expectations are more traditional, but most of the females just cowered behind while the guys did all the work. Like seriously? You need the guys to tell you to help them push and not just sit behind and watch?Half way through the series become more about the conscious ""half zombies"" than the rabid thrashing ones, which is okay, but the subplots were quite underwhelming too. The bully's obsessed with the male lead. The bullied girl decides that the person she wants to avenge the most is... the guy that tried to comfort her at the rooftop? Class president gained these super powers and couldn't die anymore... and she couldn't do anything to help? Like go out, find a safe path, find food & water? It's like having Spiderman with an invisibility buff on your team and he does almost nothing. They spent half an episode on making toilets, a much more mundane matter that nobody asked for.I wanted to like the series. I really did. I watched it as soon as it came out, but in the end it was kind of underwhelming. It wasn't terrible, it was a thrill to watch people run away from the zombies, but many of the times when they weren't actively fighting or escaping the zombies ended up pretty frustrating."
5342,All of Us Are Dead,"It started out nice. But then... firstly, I would cut the number of episodes down to just 8. And one episode should be 45 minutes long, max. The cinematography was great, Koreans are masters in this stuff. But what in the hell were the dialogues about? I'll tell you: absolutely nothing! I watched the version with Korean audio and English subtitles so MAYBE a lot got lost in the translation? But still... it was painful to watch. It went on and on and on... was it a zombie horror? Teen drama? None. It was like creators couldn't decide."
5343,All of Us Are Dead,"Imo I thought the first episode was a bit slow to get to the zombie outbreak and boy was I happy when it did.I find how the virus was made a little interesting, nothing mind blowing, but interesting. I think the only thing that gets me are the points where the writing is dumbed down so the plot can move forward. The best moment I can think of is when a kid calls the authorities. I sat there and repeated ""please don't be stupid and say ""zombies are attacking students at my school""."" and then the student brings up Train to Busan, which you should watch if you haven't yet. So far this is a good zombie series.Some points off for writing and pacing but still good."
5344,All of Us Are Dead,"Such great action and suspense! I absolutely loved how nail biting, exciting and fast paced the show was. I wrote that this show is so stressful that it distracts you from a lot of the character writing issues. I had previously written how the teenagers and adults alike frequently made such selfish choices that it felt unbelievable. I frequently was yelling at the screen wondering why would you do that in a literal life or death zombie apocalypse situation??? Like their choices just didn't seem realistic for this high stake scenario. But then I learned more about the sewol ferry accident and the depressing truth is that the choices of the adults accurately reflect reality. May those left behind Rest In Peace and I commend the show for touching on such a series topic."
5345,All of Us Are Dead,"I found myself loving the kindhearted and despising the nasty characters. I have to attribute the realness of everything to the superb acting of the young actors in this movie. Every character is complex in their own way.This is not just a zombie movie, but.in some ways a coming of age story for the young characters. Everyone seems to mature in some way.A well put together story and I just had to keep watching!This is definitely not just about zombies! :)"
5346,All of Us Are Dead,This is patchy but intriguing. It has some of the most horrific Zombie moments without having to go full Walking Dead gore fest. For the me most interesting aspects were the traditional Korean cultural values (especially family) juxtaposed to what we see in western versions of this genre. My hero was the commander - his medical protocol Vs family (in the age of COVID) was a better take than shows like Contagion.
5347,All of Us Are Dead,"I don't understand all the bad ratings, I really liked it. Some characters not so much, but in general I really liked it. It was entertaining and comical."
5348,All of Us Are Dead,One of the best Zombie series I have seen.. I don't know why some give negative reviews.. Seriously what you guyzz expect in zombie series???emotional scenes are good.. Zombie scenes nice... I could rate 10/10.
5349,All of Us Are Dead,"I don't know why, but this keeps entering my dreams.Unlike the walking dead series, this was actually going towards a direction.I wouldn't watch it if it was not a mini series. Nonetheless, the terror they could put with the zombies worth a mindful exploration, surrounded with Korean cinematography is entertaining to keep watching."
5350,All of Us Are Dead,"In the beginning, good zombie action and students working together, but then around episode 4 just got really boring, by episode 9 I was just saying ""come on, rap this up"""
5351,All of Us Are Dead,"Over all show was ok. Too long. Characters kind of doing the same thing over and over again, episode after episode. Started out ok as things fall apart. Decent stories on the people involved. Really started to drag about half way. Too many repeat battles with the main antagonist. Srsly? Ending couple of episodes were a bit better than the middle episodes. I think this genre has gone on a little too long."
5352,All of Us Are Dead,"All of us are dead is extremely graphic and disturbing than you may expect. Squeamish people... don't even try. People who want an edge-of-the-seat entertainment and can handle lavish gore... you guys are in for a ride.Each episode delivers and even though they're a bit longer than usual, they don't feel tedious. When there's no mayhem, there are the character conflicts, thus making every episode as gripping as possible.The characters are horror flick typical but they're smart and resourceful- okay maybe some foolish decisions here and there but hey they're still high school students! Seeing them come up with clever escape gimmicks is always the most fun part, as well as seeing them build trust between each other.Cinematography is fine with some striking and ominous frame shots. Sound effects are impressive and detailed (with lots and lots of squelching lol). And the zombie transformation scenes - no matter how repetitive they get - always look pretty insane!The cast are fantastic and everyone shines. I love that they're actually young actors cast as high schoolers (Hollywood take some notes!).Overall, All of us are dead succeeds at being grim, comedic, and emotional all at the same time. Definitely a neat addition to the zombie/survival genre. Looks like another Netflix hit from South Korea.8/10 worth the 12 hours.TW: Bullying / Sexual harassment / Suicide."
5353,All of Us Are Dead,"The character is not special enough to like.-For me, the atmosphere in the movie is not attractive, maybe the length is too long.-There are a lot of scenes that are a bit awkward.-There are a lot of boring dialogues.Old content but not more advanced.-Quite long for entertainment.*Other than that, the action scenes are fine."
5354,All of Us Are Dead,"It's the first time I am going to write a review without finishing a season of a series but this deserves it! If you are a zombie fan then stop reading and start watching! It is amazing it has everything you want - lots of action, gore, likable characters and hundreds of zombies..I don't want this season to finish! Well done Netflix bring more series like this!"
5355,All of Us Are Dead,"First you run, then you hide and you fight.Great zombies story, with a beginning very well written..Too much drama I guess, but it's a corean thing.."
5356,All of Us Are Dead,Series was great till middle and I was hooked.. and then episode 8 came and the director took us all for stupid and ruined it. I get it you want to have 12 episode but why ruin it?
5357,All of Us Are Dead,"If u are expecting it to be like kingdom or train to busan. Then this is not it. Storyline' s a bit mundane, some actings are -meh-. Reviewers here are smitten by the cute Koreans actors period and nothing more. So expect bias reviews and ""don't listen to hater"" quotes used. SIMPS reviews are not actual reviews so do yourself a favour don't waste bingeing this series like I did. You are better off re watching the other awesome zombie series/movies."
5358,All of Us Are Dead,"I had a blast watching this! It's not groundbreaking or bringing anything new to the table. At its core, this is a story about friendship and family. There were some really heartwarming and gut wrenching scenes. It did get very formulaic at times - reach x checkpoint, something happens, then reach y checkpoint, but overall it was a really fun watch."
5359,All of Us Are Dead,"3 episodes in, I have to say I'm enjoying it.Yes it's not perfect at all;
whenever someone is transforming in a zombie, people just stare and stay still. While there's enough time to take action like throw him/her out of a window or bash its skull. Rather than doing that they just watch and start running when the zombie has fully transformed. I could understand that the first time. But after the same person has seen more than 10 zombie 'transformations', and still does not take action and is surprised the zombie then launches at them, you start to wonder how stupid they actually are...CGI doesn't look to good when there is action involved like a zombie launching itself at someone.Saying that, I have to admit really enjoying this show. It's well acted, well written, sometimes even original and overall it's just tons of fun.A solid 7 for me."
5360,All of Us Are Dead,"I like Korean horror films but this series is kind of lazy. Fast zombies, frantic action, some good gore, but then it's just more but slightly different. Some of the slower scenes were scarier by far.And I like an honest answer to this. Do Korean schools have that serious a bullying problem??!! That was a f-ed up. Seriously. The adults too. Wth.The few things that gave a glimpse in Korean culture are always appreciated. The school itself was kind if interesting and reminded me a little of when I visited a Japanese elementary school.Bottom line - It was fun for a while and then I just stopped watching early in episode 3. More of the same."
5361,All of Us Are Dead,"The level of violence and the evil nature of the kids might be more than I could deal with. Truly some of the worst kids I've ever seen.I love horror movies and nothing much puts me off, except this show definitely takes the cake.Not for the faint of heart."
5362,All of Us Are Dead,Seriously guys if your going to get paid to write a review by Netflix at least give it a 8. People giving this a 10 is the most ridiculous thing ever.. it's ok I guess maybe because I watched the English dubbed version they may have screwed it up or made it corny on purpose I'm not sure.. giving this a 10 is actually insulting too people who read reviews to be honest.
5363,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm so glad that i got to watch such an amazing zombie series. The best part is that they didn't left any loose ends and explained the reason and cause everything very smoothly. And the scenes were too reall i binged watched it and it felt like I'm with those school students .Plus they highlighted the fact of bullying and reality of society, first squid game, then hellbound and then All of us are dead. I'm looking forward to it's season 2."
5364,All of Us Are Dead,"Like Squid Game, this series weaves in South Korean discontent.Rich kids vs Welfare kid.Class struggles.Government Oppression - Martial Law, etc.And, of course, bullying.I got laughter out of the Translation to English.It's funny to listen to English dialogue that was dubbed based on what the Koreans think Americans want to hear - especially the girls.I give this a 5... right down the middle.Squid Game is better."
5365,All of Us Are Dead,This show is entertaining but full of completely nonsense and absurd choices by the characters. Things no one ever would do if they were in that situation. I almost stopped watching when 2 characters decide to have an emotional conversation as the zombies are seconds away from getting in the room.It's things like that that kill the feeling of urgency of a show.
5366,All of Us Are Dead,"Pilot was very weak I must say But show picks up pace in completely contrasting fashion from second episode and depicts almost everything a lover for zombie shows wants.But it's NOT for you if you can't stand Gore at all.Well obviously you can't compare it to 'The Walking Dead' but they have done a very good job.So if you love zombie shows, give it a shot one episode beyond the pilot."
5367,All of Us Are Dead,"I am 22 years old. I grew up with Dawn of the Dead, and I must say, this show is far better. It's like taking a bland dish and adding the right spices to it to make an even better dish; sorry DOTD fans, I still love DOTD, but it's no longer my favorite apocalypse film; it will go down in history as the best of it's time.I am a huge fan of the Beastars. Just an FYI, I know that this film takes place in Korea while the Beastars Netflix Series takes place in Japan, but the High School setting; the mystery theme of who or what is behind a killing, the character's voices/mannerisms and even their uniform remind me of the Beastars; the hero dude Cheogsan who has a secret crush on Onjo reminds me of Legoshi and Haru for instance.This is hands down the BEST zombie-apocalypse movie-series of all time. I call it a movie series because the episodes are like movie segments, that really don't feel like they're a hour long. It's absolutely hilarious too. I've so far watched 3 episodes. I would hate to spoil it for those who want to see a Sci-Fi masterpiece that still managed to be original. The character arcs are gripping, and you grow an attachment to the main characters really quickly.Since it's full of gore, I'd say it's best fit for ages 17 and up.In many ways, the zombie-virus reminds me of COVID, but is way worse than covid; Contagion's virus was eerily just like coronavirus too, but again not as terrifying as the one on this show. Made me think, ""Maybe Covid isn't so bad,"" and the importance of our modern-day technology!The animation is intense, so-much-so that you forget this is just a movie. If you watch it long enough, you actually start to feel there; the makeup and animation is simply so compelling. Immediately, when you begin to watch it, you're HOOKED. You'll feel empathy, fear, suspense, and amusement AT ONCE. Every single character on here is interesting and talented; both the actors on the screen, and the voice-over actors; you can't even tell that it's a voice over, and I really had to study their lip movements, which still seem to be in sync; you seriously WON'T notice it very much at all.You'll be determined to see what happens to all of them, and if they make it out because the title itself just draws people in. It is brilliant. Every single shot and angle is perfectly paced in line with the story. I never feel like characters stall or are dragging the time, like I've seen with even some Disney+ Originals; move aside Disney and take some notes, because Netflix Originals did it AGAIN with another masterpiece.It is bound to jerk some tears of sadness or shock, or make you cry laughing. You seriously can't get bored with this one - even I can't and I am attention-deficient. This is definitely binge-watchable if you can stomach the realisticness of the gore and suspense. Sometimes I even forgot that the characters can't hear me through the screen when they're unbeknowst of a zombie's approaching. I can see why this made the top 10, but this baby could go in a top 3 tier list. I have yet to find something that comes as close to it!"
5368,All of Us Are Dead,"Although there are some logical mistakes I love it. Friendship relationship , actors and actress , generally vibes from the series are amazing. Looks like put really huge amount of money on production. One of the main reason to love Korean series."
5369,All of Us Are Dead,"That's right. If you're a teenager or have a teenager IQ for movies. This ones for you and most movies out there.Disappointing but didn't expect too much. Dialogue is simple. Yes the culture is diff than America or Europe but story is relatable. Some really terrible emotional scenes for characters that are almost adults. It's really a waste of time after the 3rd episode. I wasted my time cuz I was in a snowpocalypse for 2 days. It's a very frustrating to watch, characters are dull, slow at times and plenty of rip off zombie scenes."
5370,All of Us Are Dead,"""Zombies are done, there's nothing left to explore. I'm gonna watch this, only for the gore and make-up effects. I guess I'm interested in how they portray the zombies, also, I need to kill a few hours..""That was me. What I got was a riveting series. One that pulled my in by the neck, and never let up. This series is a master class in suspense and character.It's so good! Thanks to everyone who made this, honestly!"
5371,All of Us Are Dead,"First, its boring. How come a zombie movie boring? Thats surprised me as well.The writing is so bad. Is the story writer newbie?The story went slowly, they try to put emotional scenes, but the scenes were not touching at all. Theres a lot of crying but im not even feel sad. And im actually easily moved.I try so hard not to skip and fast forwards those episodes.What with the teen love story? They have no chemistry, so intead of moved by their hearts, its just like some baseless stupid move.The students were not so bright, 6 episodes and none of them try to hold something for a weapon with them all the time, not even broom or a stick. I get it if they are stupid, but having a survival instinct would be rational.Im questioning all of their decisions. Lol. These kids have no hope.And finally, none of the cast that makes you feel like ""i hope they survive"", if at the end all of them is dead, its not even surprising, and even satisfying. Seeing how thise kids act in the middle of crisis.The only good stuff is the bloody scenes, those are executed well. But still, you need to skip like half of the time to see bloody scenes."
5372,All of Us Are Dead,"I like the show but I don't like the show. I want to feel like this could actually happen. Zombies infestation and now you have to survive. So why are we talking about our feelings and who likes who? We should be making plans and executing plans not stopping to talk about how this makes us feel. It takes the realism out of it. This could be a great show if the writers said what would I do in this situation instead of how can we throw in as many metaphors and quotes that now for some reason we have to analyze. Also, weren't those soldiers trained? How did they miss shooting him so badly that he was only hit randomly underwater? They should've lit him up profusely before he even touched the water. The jokes are cool and even the playfulness is okay but when things get so far fetched that it alters what the characters do it makes the scene nonsensical. I'm in the middle of the 7th episode right now. Hope nothing truly dumb comes up to alter the me watching a second season."
5373,All of Us Are Dead,That girl in the white hoodie took my nerves.So annoying af ngl I nearly quit that show so annoying this girl was. Who cast her ? Real question WHO ? Was that guy on some pills or something ?
5374,All of Us Are Dead,"Honestly, the trailer looked awesome but the show itself is absolutely disappointing! It's so slow, so much talking and too many plotlines that are not needed.The gore was okay but could've been better. So many characters did not make sense, within a matter of minutes the virus has made half human and half zombie without there being a follow up on that.Characters that should've had a big impact on the story end up being pointless. There is more time spent talking and sitting around a fire than there is zombies. They spend so much of the time running from room to room which could easily been avoided if they just secured the room.The fact that too many characters are annoying and just do nothing for the story.This show is bad. Really bad. I do not recommend."
5375,All of Us Are Dead,"Honestly looks like they had everything (budget) to make this a great tv show
unfortunately is horrible and poorly written.The characters omg , where should l start?Are we suppose to do think that teens in schools are so dumb?Zero skills to survive or think head ?One of the main character the fight fighter daughter , shockingly slow and dumb or maybe she has some mental issues?But overall all the characters super sad, pathetic, useless.Why did the writers write such a thing?Not even one of them was switch on.Also some flashbacks about happy memories super super cheesymaybe if you are a boy/girl under 10years old you might love it but if you have some decent intelligence you might feel this is extremely sad and dumb.Example they see someone no zombie yet and they wait until he/she become a zombie and then they start screaming :P instead of killing it before
. That happened many many times.And many others situation are actually hard to watch.The Adults acting is actually very bad too.Like l said before its a shame because they had all to make this great.And instead they made everyone useless and no charismatic at all.I couldn't have any sympathy with any of them at all.Please try to make it a little realistic at least a little this was sad."
5376,All of Us Are Dead,"I just finished season 1 and I get the first 3-4 episode were meh... the kids made a lot of trash decisions. I do like a lot of apocalyptic movies/series, So its a 9/10 I know its to high but... well see how it goes with Season 2."
5377,All of Us Are Dead,"Some very cringey moments, idiotic decisions made by characters and it drags too but once you get used to it you can get hooked.Not the best Zombie show out there but it's quite entertaining. Hope they make Season 2."
5378,All of Us Are Dead,"Simply put, this series had a great opening but jumped the shark as quickly as it began. The characters are what reduced my score from potential 8 stars. They simply became too annoying from half-way and on. I got so infuriated with the teenagers whining and arguing to no end. The whole season was like watching a cat fight. I can see one or two brash characters, but almost all of them either physically or mentally abuse one other. Is that Korean culture for kids to act that way? There are barely any redeemable quality any of the teens possessed. And some plots dragged for far too long like Gwami and the suicidal girl (forgot her name). She is the perfect character to be redeemed; to do something that mattered to the plot in a positive way. Sadly they made her an even more of a depressing villain. It's sad to say, but I kind of wished all of the kids turned at the end. They were that badly written."
5379,All of Us Are Dead,They overrated the drama the series was just crying and surviving i guess this is korean drama it's not interesting or the story so ridiculous kids can make better zombie series better than this.
5380,All of Us Are Dead,The zombies are good. But honestly all of those kids should be dead within the first 5 minutes from their decision making. Everything else seemed unrealistic.
5381,All of Us Are Dead,"Mostly dragging on to much, with wooden acting and just laughable dialogue. Its pretty boring most of the time, with hilarious scenes in which main characters dodge dozens of zombies in narrow corridors becaus plot armor. Emotional impact missing, some deaths just random and some ... lets say weird superpowers. If one had started to fly at the end, I would not hav been surprised.Made it to episode 6 before checking out.It is well crafted in some regards, hence a 6 out of 10. But you won't miss out much if you don't watch it."
5382,All of Us Are Dead,"What a rollercoaster! If you like any suspenseful (zombie) movies/series (Train to Busan, Kingdom, Sweet Home) with a touch of romance. This is a must watch!Cheong-San & Nim-ra are the ones stealing the show. Cheong-San devotion to his friends & family made his character really likable. You really feel for him. My favorite scene was the library scene of Cheong-San. He really has the toughest action scenes of the whole cast. I hope he is one of the halbies in an upcoming season. For Nim-ra she slowly grown into me from a not so interesting character to one of the main focus of the story.Mostly I have difficulties with the Korean names. I tend to mix them up, but luckily the names here chosen are easier to recognize and to remember.Only thing I missed and I really was anticipating for was a show down between the bullied girl Eung-ji and the bully Gwi-nam. This was a miss since Eung-ji has now all the strength to fight back.Looking forward to season 2!"
5383,All of Us Are Dead,"Very good series, covering the bullying problem in schools well.Not too reliant on CGI and no sugar coated happy ending that you get with American programmes/films."
5384,All of Us Are Dead,"I saw the trailer and was like ""It'll be ok"" cos I like the zombie genre and I think Train To Busan is the greatest zombie movie of all time. So I was looking forward to this show but with a very average expectation. So I watched the firsts episode and instantly got hooked. The introduced the characters well, friction between all of them was further developed even better as the show progresses. It is fun, thrilling and an entertaining show that had me binging deep into the night. 12 episode and I thought none felts boring. It is a very good show and worth it very much."
5385,All of Us Are Dead,"What a thrilling ride!! Literally keeps you on edge of your seat!!! Don't go with nagative reviews. I don't know what they expect from zombie movies/series!Really liked character development throughout the episodes. Plot is amazing! Enjoyed those comic parts, and thank god they mept these comic scenes becase at some points everything gets so intense that my breathing just stopped, but thanks to those funny scenes that gave some relaxation!"
5386,All of Us Are Dead,"Exceptional! If you loved Train to Busan, you're going to like this one too. It might not be moving as fast as the movie since it's a series after all. But acting, storytelling etc. Have been executed well. And you cannot really predict what's going to happen in the next episode!"
5387,All of Us Are Dead,"I thought the zombie acting was very realistic, from the growling, to the walking on the floor like the exorcist, and their joints cracking. I loved that most of the kids that survived had a connection with a least another student aside from On-jos dad that ended up dying, that's what made it so emotional. That's the part of the story line that kept me watching. The only thing I disliked and I thought was like kind of dumb about this story, is the fact that this science teacher started a whole ass pandemic due to his son getting bullied ? I don't condemn that kind of behavior from anyone of course. And he needed to do something about it. However, creating a virus because of it, it's the dumbest most selfish thing I've ever heard."
5388,All of Us Are Dead,"This Korean fun and thriller show is a really great example of how students think when they are in school when they ""daydream"". The show has few really great twist and turns that makes the show more fun and lovable to watch. One season is only there but from the start till the end the show will not let you leave your seats. Yes there are a few loopholes but every movie or series have them but the good thing is that more good things are there to talk about. In short a really good and fun show to watch if one loves zombies."
5389,All of Us Are Dead,"This show is like The Walking Dead, but instead of 70% of the cast being totally uninteresting, useless, and annoying, 100% manages to live up to that lame standard. It reminds me of the rubbish programming that Netflix used to provide about five years ago. Back when people were canceling their memberships in mass."
5390,All of Us Are Dead,"Okay so the good - it's fun, the pacing works well and keeps you interested. The characters are played by young actors to reflect their high-school personas. Overall the concept is great and it starts off very promising. There's also some original strategies to escaping the zombies which is nice to see.Now for the bad - the writing has no direction. Characters are built up over episodes only to be wasted away in minutes. The build up to pay off ratio, in terms of plot and character development for each character, feels completely unbalanced and poorly considered.This wasteful storytelling becomes frustrating at the midway point where it's easy to stop caring about anything or anyone since it seems like the writers also don't seem to care."
5391,All of Us Are Dead,"First, I highly recommend watching with original audio and subtitles. The dub version voice acting is just not engaging enough.This classic zombie plot series stands out by deeply portraying a variety of characters who don't typically frustrate the viewer by making poor decisions. You begin to connect with the characters and empathize with their decisions. Don't get too cozy with them as the series takes a GOT ""no character is safe"" approach.From start to finish each zombie encounter felt real. Nothing seemed too absurd including the various emotional impacts of certain decisions.Excellent series with minimal areas for improvement!"
5392,All of Us Are Dead,"An absolute gem, great story, great acting and fantastic make up and effects. Flew through the season and left me hoping for season 2. I can't recommend enough. Teen woes, deadly zombie virus, desperate rescues and sacrifices. No one is safe."
5393,All of Us Are Dead,"If you liked Kingdom, this will be right up your street.The plot revolves around a zombie outbreak in a small town in South Korea and centres prominently on the students of the local high school. The twist here is that some infected remain more or less human and are a danger to the survivors with one in particular slowly hunting them down. There are back stories for most students and their cooperation is tantamount to their survival.The zombie chase scenes are fast paced and mostly believable. There are also poignant moments to change the pace along with some slower tense horror elements. The show also touches on guilt of those involved in dealing with the larger zombie problem.It's a well made, acted and scripted show that contains scenes that stand up against some big budget movies. Here's hoping for a second season."
5394,All of Us Are Dead,"This show is amazing. They bring a fresh take on the zombie genre with notes on innocent love, true friendships, and hardships that are honestly heartbreaking at times. It's well rounded and disappointing at times but it's so incredibly worth watching. I rated the show a 9/10 because I am so disappointed at who loses their lives. There's so many characters you fall in love with only to lose them. There could have been at least one off limits!"
5395,All of Us Are Dead,"At a time where the zombie apocalypse scenarios seems already saturated and overdone, there comes a show that breathes some new life (ironic, I know) into the genre.All of Us Are Dead is an extremely well-made show that nails pretty much everything it sets out to do. The action is almost constante and relentless, but they still find time to work some effective and really well written drama, excellent characters and even some goofy comedy scenes.There's a lot to love here, but I think what really makes this show works is the characters. In a similar vein to Stranger Things' first season, they managed to create some really compelling and emotionally engaged cast of characters. The teenagers are not unsufferable assholes like in most shows, instead they feel like real people, with real issues and strenghts, and you really want to see them succeed and escape.It's one of those shows merely talking about it doesn't really does it justice. It can even sound kind of dumb in paper, but once you see it action on the screen, you get mesmerized. The people behind this show really pulled off some bold and creative ideas that many other would've easily screw up.Especial credits must be given to the young cast of actors, who not only have stellar dramatic performance, but also some incredibly physical stunt work and zombie sequences.The only downsides I can think of are some (very) minor plot holes and the fact that the show does get a little tiny bit repectitive. Other than that, this is a must watch, especially for genre fans."
5396,All of Us Are Dead,Was this supposed to be the Korean version of Stranger Things? I love Asian cinema but this is so childish And badly acted that I quit after one episode. Move along. Nothing to see here.
5397,All of Us Are Dead,"I have just done binge-watching the whole drama within a night and have enjoyed it! Well, the plot has some weak points that will be easy to finger-pointing while watching. However, it makes more sense than other monstrous apocalyptic k-dramas on Netflix that I have seen (e.g. Better than Sweet Home in many aspects I'd say).It has pointed out the problem with our justice system and humanity. Also, that, at dangerous moments, it's love and hope that binds us together.Jumping to the ending scene, it's nice that it has ended with giving hope that not everyone that we saw dead is actually dead. I bet that if there's a second season, it'll show Cheong-san surviving the bombing (by becoming a mutated zombie like Gwi-Nam with self-regenerating power)."
5398,All of Us Are Dead,"I don't know how the people are watching this stupitidy who gave more than 3 stars ??? With their eyes or their asses I dont know really. What I know is, considering the stupitidies done in this serie, people would do the same idiotic things in real life too in same situations. So that means, people who gave more than 3 stars are in the same idiotic mind with the people in the serie."
5399,All of Us Are Dead,At first it seemed mostly korean soap drama but as it progresses the story gets better and better. It was enjoyable and I liked the way people would react (from ordinary people to military and even political people).
5400,All of Us Are Dead,"One of the best zombie series from Korea after kingdom...!!!! A must see ..!!!Awesome action sequences, suspense , gore , the scenes cherographed was too good , and the story was great...!!!"
5401,All of Us Are Dead,"All of us Are Dead: This is a zombie Survival thriller web series. How this virus spreads from one school to the whole city and everyone is trying to save their lives, is shown in the series. The series gets interesting from the first episode itself. Direction is good but editing could have been better. Every episode is for one hour, so it gets boring at times. The work by all the actors was fantastic and the zombies looked great too. Although the concept was not new, it was heartening to see the way it was presented to us. You can definitely watch it once."
5402,All of Us Are Dead,Really decent at first when I saw it on the netflix programmes you might like i though it looks two bob but put it on for background and couldn't take my eyes off it the further in you watch the better it gets. Pure action no pc cr*b just non stop. Wish the west made zombies like this.
5403,All of Us Are Dead,"This show had some things going for it. The government that is actually competent, the original (as far as I know) idea of halfbies and the fact that's it not in the US made me hope for a unique take on a zombie show.However, this show falls into the same mistakes as so many of its competitors: illogical decisions and behaviour by the survivors. It tires me to think how many times this show did the thing where everybody stand around the person who is, as everyone is very aware of, about to turn into a zombie, but instead of taking advantage of the zombies weakness before it fully turns, they stare at it with mouths wide open. This stands among many plot holes and issues I had with the show, from very general things like the dumb self-sacrifices to specific things like the forest hiking sequence in the last episode where On-Jo follows the golden ribbons. I don't think I have to explain why that scene was ridiculous.Going into this show, I was excited for a good take on a zombie show and was, in most aspects, disappointed."
5404,All of Us Are Dead,It's fun! The main characters were escaping throughout the series only to be trapped. At last they finally escape with losing some of their friends. A freaking YouTuber makes us laugh! Jae-ik and the man are a good comedic duo. Gwi-nam is a freaking character and also he keeps the series interesting. It will be great. Cheong-San's death brings up tears. Overall the best zombie series.
5405,All of Us Are Dead,"I went into this series completely blind, somehow even missed the zombies on the cover. I'm generally not a fan of media that have to do with zombies but this is one I actualy enjoyed quite a bit.The action scenes worked really really well and must have been quite hard to film with all the chaos happening in each scene and how many zombies were there attacking and running. I found all those scenes very impressive and genuinely had me at the edge of my seat.The soundtrack of the series isn't all that much but in a show like this where you constantly run around that doesn't really mean it's that big of a deal. The actors did a really good job as well, no complaints in that aspect.Now when it comes to the writting of this series, you can more or less understand (mostly) where the show is going. They need to find a cure for the virus and as always there are people that are somehow kind of immune to it which did disappointed me as it is a plot tool used in every zombie-themed movie.The main ""villain"", Gwi Nam was indeed threatening but seeing him rise so many times after getting hit and thrown off the building I laughed and found it silly almost. Also, I am certain that when he first killed a zombie (stabbing it on the throat) some blood got in his mouth so given the events that continued he should have turned into a zombie at that point already. Another thing I'd like to point out that didn't make sense to me was what they did with Na-yeon. I expected she'd turn into half a zombie as Gwi Nam bit her but that didn't happen and even though I hated her as a character I did want to see something more be done with her character.Last I want to point out my biggest problem with the series. It took me too many episodes to start caring about the characters. I didn't want them to get killed but I didn't care enough either. Half the reason is probably because teenagers act as teenagers but the romance parts felt very unnecessary at times and really made the show slow down and made the situation with the zombie apocalypse seem less important to the characters which I found ridiculous.Were there too many deaths? Yes. Were they unnecessary? Some of them. For example Onjo's father which ended up being my favorite character. I found him the most grounded character in the whole show and was really disappointed to see him die the way he did after all that development. Development is essential for me to make a death actually impactful but with him I felt like he was killed off just to keep our main characters the kids."
5406,All of Us Are Dead,Where do i start... this is about teenagers and puppy love kinda story. The plot is lame and the script is the worst. This is a Zombie series for preteens or younger. Not good... stay away.My 2 stars arr for good zombie effects and cgi.
5407,All of Us Are Dead,AOUAD is great zombie survival show though it borrows many elements from other manga's (like sweet home) and train to busan but it is really original. Forget high school of the dead thats pure echhi. But this is really thrilling survival horror show. Cinematography and direction is good. Zombies are scaries. Show isn't predictable and ending is not that good. Cliffhangers are bad but action makes it all for it. If you liked this i recommend read SWEET HOME webtoon. A must watch for people coming in zombie genre.
5408,All of Us Are Dead,"Very thrilling and emotional for me. If you lose everyone you love very truly, and still you are not able to do anything, this hurts very much. I think this webseries is for strong hearted people where lot of violence is present."
5409,All of Us Are Dead,"This show has all the check-marks you'd expect from a fairly high budget show.And yet, it all falls completely flat as it tries to present a gruesome horror setting, combined with corny and comedic anime-like characters and situation handling.It's watchable from start to finish ... but you really need to turn your brain off ... almost to the point like a zombie at at least half of it ...Some episodes are bloated by either dragged out scenes or by repetition. Watching someone turn for the 6th time, in the same dramatic way, without previously building an emotional connection to those characters is played out by the 3rd episode.Most of the situations are handled borderline moronic, and the consistency of the plot is reminiscent of a wet fart.The worst of it was suffered by the dialog. It was either written by a computer, or a person who'd previously had very little social interaction with others.If I'd have to come up with key-words that best describe the show, they would be: inconsistent, borderline comedic, dragged out and non-sensical.I still can't decide if this was intended to be a comedy or a satire of the zombie genre, because it definitely can't be taken serious as horror/drama. And the show is self aware of what it's trying to do, as its characters reference the far better executed Train to Busan in more then once.I'm aware that it's a zombie movie, so it's a ""turn your brain off"" kind of viewing, but this show puts absolutely no effort into trying to take itself serious even within it's own imaginary world.This would have worked 100% better as an animated feature considering the cartoonish characters situation handling and presentation."
5410,All of Us Are Dead,"The first 3 episodes are really promising that I can't wait for more. Then the series goes downhill to the last episode. It became so cliche and lame. For instances; Nam Ra could have just screams run to them once she smelled zombies instead of detecting how many zombies were coming. Also, instead of running on the road, why wouldn't they just hide in an empty house? Moreover, they decided to fight the zombies with sticks and hammer? Okay Thor. And the mom is the dumbest by entering a field full with infected and called the obviously infected and get eaten. She deserved it. The father of the female lead went through a lot to find her daughter just to have a less than a minute scene with her. Also, there are too many self reflecting scenes among them. Honestly, we don't care. Last but not least, the director could've just utilized the halfbies (The bully and Nam Ra) characters more. It'd be a great ending if they both fighting for their own interest either for good and bad. Or maybe they could control all the zombies and use their ability to end the pandemic. The directors probably save the characters for the next series I hoped."
5411,All of Us Are Dead,I only watched 2 episode right now ...guys its awsome its not serious like TWD.but its not funny as ZOMBOAT...trust me you will like it even you are not ZOMBIE fan .....
5412,All of Us Are Dead,"I don't know, I simply enjoyed it. I liked the teenage drama feel combined with gore and survival. Although I feel like there were too many unnecessary deaths, everyone was always sacraficing themselves, it was starting to get annoying.I hope we get a season 2 and a proper storyline for the ""half zombies""ps Cheong-san deserved better!"
5413,All of Us Are Dead,Shame cause first episode was amazing zombies runing around people runing away really good action.But then second episode kids drama and plot armor to main kids.They start kicking zombies ash and.one kid is Jett Lee.3 episode is the same way i just got tierd of it.Shame cause first episode was amazing!
5414,All of Us Are Dead,So far it's been a generic plot. Nothing happening other than people turning into zombies.5/10 coz I haven't watched it in entirety.Waste of time tbh.
5415,All of Us Are Dead,"It was a good series
Watched it after #alive
Idk why lol but all korean movies seem to be about zombies but they cool i like them
Talking about this series was worth watching every second and minute of the movie was worth it.Loved it."
5416,All of Us Are Dead,"Seeing this on Netflix trending list I expected something watchable, not some dumb zombie series in which every character behaves like a zombie even before they become one."
5417,All of Us Are Dead,"The first couple of episodes was a bust, i was on the verge of quitting it but I decided to continue and I am glad I did. The reason as a lot of people said before me was the emotions in the first couple of episodes lacked, however further on their emotions do come out. Had some funny parts as well as sad parts. I enjoyed it so watch all the episodes before you rate it because it does get better."
5418,All of Us Are Dead,"I did noy expect this movie to be very good but it did surprise me in many ways. Definitely its the best zombie movie right now.It has pretty much everything - good evolving story, zombies, kids, love stories and politicians, nice cliff hangers in each episode etc."
5419,All of Us Are Dead,"Just when I thought I'd lost my appetite for Zombies, this gem of a series turns up on Netflix. For me it ticks all the boxes, I like the story behind how the virus was created. As you should, I liked and disliked the main characters in equal measure. There were enough perilous situations to keep me entertained and characters were killed off on a regular basis. As always with the Korean shows, they managed to bring some originality to proceedings. So it's a solid 8 from me."
5420,All of Us Are Dead,"This series is like a heaven for zombie lovers. 12 hours of constant fast paced zombies. Story is good, acting is good. The way they created the scene and casted actors, everything is amazing. I watch even stupid zombie movies, but this one was done really really well. Go for it. After Kingdom, train to busan this is one of best next gem from Korean cinemas. Congrats to all the team !!"
5421,All of Us Are Dead,Watched the whole thing despite it being very bad. Had a couple of redeeming aspects like the halfbie concept but overall just lame. It really drags everything out for so long. The constant falling over gets really annoying. Go watch Black Summer if you want zombies. Go watch 8th grade or Booksmart if you want modern teen drama.
5422,All of Us Are Dead,"I started watching this with no great expectations .. I just like a good zombie series and needed something that would be easy to watch ..and yet I found myself really taking a shine to the characters..it really is all you could possibly hope for in a zombie program...exciting, plenty of deaths, plenty of bad decisions for sure ..but nothing too unrealistic in my opinion.....thoroughly enjoyed this, and found it quite original in tone.. in a genre that's been seriously abused by the Walking Dead franchise among others......"
5423,All of Us Are Dead,"I was so excited to see this. First three episodes were good but then sloppy writing took place. There is so much that happens that makes ZERO sense. How can people go days and days without water or food? Why wouldn't you hide in a house or store when you know zombies are headed for you; instead, you stand outside? You see someone you care for get bitten and is turning, but you cry and tell others not to kill them?Definitely, the writers need to be replaced for season two and stop writing material that makes no sense. Have some sense of reality and what could happen. The over dramatic teen angst and was too much. By then end, I wanted all of the characters to die because I was so frustrated with the shows."
5424,All of Us Are Dead,This series is one of the best zombie survival. It resembles train to busan. But it eas great to show the series interesting throughout 12 hours. Not boring at any place. Many seat cornering scenes are there . One of the best thriller k drama after squid game. Worth for 12 hours.
5425,All of Us Are Dead,Some of the characters were a little annoying and the romantic interests felt just a bit silly and somewhat ill fitting given it's an apocalyptic scenario. I felt it was aimed at a predominantly teen audience and that it was really quite laboured with not a great deal happening given that it was over 11 hours of TV. It could easily have been done in 8 episodes. Those criticisms aside it was otherwise reasonably entertaining.
5426,All of Us Are Dead,"Stopped watching partway through the second episode.Couldn't stand the truly terrible ""physics"" in the CGI sequences. Makes typical ragdoll physics in a game look fantastic in comparison.Characters are stupid, not just because they lack any depth or realistic motivation, they are stupid.So many sequences where dozens of bystanders don't react at all to a dramatic event that would in reality draw the attention of anyone nearby.Scenes don't make any sense and are clumsily thrown in in a misguided attempt to add meaning or depth. (sudden and convenient influx in people/zombies jumping out windows for example)Another overrated pile of garbage."
5427,All of Us Are Dead,"I usually love these these types of shows but this was absolutely painful to sit through. How do you make a show where every single character is unlikable? Seriously, the students are all rapists, thugs, bullies. The teachers are monsters. The police are monsters. I don't think the writers of this show understand that you actually need someone to cheer for otherwise its just pointless violence. For comparison, Happiness (2021) is a million times better zombie show than this garbage."
5428,All of Us Are Dead,"This series has been pulled unnecessarily into 12 long bad episodes. Extremely slow, and cliche acting and storyline. Some of the actors are so bad, they literally have zero reaction even after seeing a zombie...lol. Does not live up to the over hyped trailers...sigh."
5429,All of Us Are Dead,This show is pretty awesome and well done.If you dont like teenagers in school this isnt for you.If you love everything zombies then you'll enjoy the heck out of this.It has lots of great zombie attacks and isnt dull.I hope there is as many seasons as the walking dead or at least a few more.
5430,All of Us Are Dead,"Wow is it really stressful to watch #AllOfUsAreDead ? I really want to tune in but seeing all of the reaction makes me think twice lol. What else is there to say about this series once for sure, even those who like zombies must see it."
5431,All of Us Are Dead,"Some reviews ""big this up"" and others don't, I'm in the don't camp. Watched E 1&2 then jumped to E 12 to see the ending (nothing special).Seems Korean students ages range from mid-twenties to late thirties. The one upside is not watching the woke inclusive snooze-fest that would be forced upon oneself if filmed in a western country."
5432,All of Us Are Dead,"What was that?? I'm completely amazed, bruh.Ignore the bad reviews already. Just watch it for ur own fun.It's Gory, and I loved it. Watched the first 5 episode. And it's a good run.This is a good series in the zombie franchise.Must watch.Gumawo."
5433,All of Us Are Dead,"Very good show, i love the mix between high school drama and zombies, the producers focused on group of people and made you interact with their problems to evoke your empathy when they die you feel sad, and it worked smoothly as indented, that technique in storytelling always makes me question my morals do i only care about the group of people they present maybe thousands died but i only got affected when the main character died: i love stories about a war between love and fear which makes the moments with the loved one more valuable, i really dig that kind of romance; overall the show is a success."
5434,All of Us Are Dead,"Storywise, I like this series better than ""Happiness"" because the happy ending is not too forced.However, in terms of the actors, especially the ML and FL, Happiness won. Both ML and the FL are so good looking and attractive in Happiness while on this ""All of us are dead"" are not as attractive as the other series.Nevertheless, Hyeong syuk - Nam Ra are definitely my favorite characters here.The zombies were also more realistic here than Happiness.Another part that I feel very realistic was when they needed to go to the toilet. The fact that you're fighting the living dead doesn't make you immune to pooping and peeing!!I hope there would be 2nd season bc I'm curious about Nam Ra story."
5435,All of Us Are Dead,"Some SpoilersThe series is overall very entertaining and tense but the script writers went the cheap way like many zombie related films. The first few episodes are fantastic and, i genuinely say this, a must watch for any fan of this genre.The rest, however, is not as perfect. The show is still entertaining and worth it, yes, but it suffers from the excessive plot armor syndrome present in many zombie-related works.The show tries to alleviate this feeling of ""cheapness"" by killing off some developed characters but it's still irritating to see the same character keep coming back and back just because the plot of the high-school group would be a bit too predictable without them. What this leads to is a predictable sequence of events, but unpredictable character deaths (except for 2).The acting is as believable as it is enjoyable and there's only a little amount of wooden characters (which is a really good aspect of in show.)It's pretty safe to say that the target audience is a group of high schoolers because the constant emotional drama (that seem to be not very important and just there) between the characters might bore the average viewer.This is a modern and entertaining addition to the genre and worth binging for those itching for more zombie action. I was going to give it a 7/10, but the intro riff is so good, I bumped it up to a righteous 8/10."
5436,All of Us Are Dead,"Honestly speaking , I thought this would be just a random zombie series that others usually do . But this one hits different . There are a few lags in between , yes but none of them matter coz that's what adds up to show . The start maybe a bit slow where the students hide in different rooms but after the 4th episode, I binged till the end. That's how the show keeps you hooked up . Kudos to everyone involved and thankyou for such an amazing experience."
5437,All of Us Are Dead,"A series which is scary , emotional , and love story .A perfect combination!You will definitely connect with the characters .Good cinematography .Best camera anglesBest visual effectsBest camera qualityStoryline is bestEverything is goodYou should watch this series ."
5438,All of Us Are Dead,"If you want to have a good laugh with friends, you've come to the right place. I've reached the conclusion that this series was actually produced, funded, filmed,
directed and acted by the high school teenagers themselves. What a scream..."
5439,All of Us Are Dead,"One of the greatest zombie story ever told on screen, the atmosphere and characters make this TV show so relatable and remarkable. If you love zombie apocalypse genre that will be your cup of tea, can't wait for season 2!"
5440,All of Us Are Dead,"Its about choices, ethical dilemmas, power, helplessness, politics, bullying, principles and about what makes life worth living.I found the series to be ok, some of the very typical Korean fat shaming, dumb shaming and self worth through societal achievements, but I guess it comes with the territory.I find it quite weird that there isn't a whole legion of people complaining and calling it woke. Guess they hid it well enough with splatter and gore.Then again most Zombie movies are about us and choices."
5441,All of Us Are Dead,"I don't get all the negative reviews. Entertaining zombie film with a touch of Korean comedy and Korean drama. Great acting from everyone. Don't read other reviews, watch and decide for yourself."
5442,All of Us Are Dead,I love this show. The story and the character actions and development are well written and logical. Nothing happens because plot needs it to happen. It's well tied up and smart. People don't make stupid decisssion like we are used to seeing in this type of shows. Their motives are linked to their characters and relationships. Also it does portray how I imagine a real apocalypse would look like where people die on regular basis regardless how much we root for them not to. However the last couple of episodes appear to be quite repetitive with similar set pieces and situations. Also the main villain and his interaction with the surviving students is just a tiny bit annoying for the reasons you will have to see for yourself. I will finish with the positive note as the show also avoids the preachy trap of western shows and focused on the story rather then social messages and mandatory tick-boxing. Overall a great show. After the squid game this is absolutely a must-see runner up.
5443,All of Us Are Dead,"What happens if you mix five doses of bullying, a handful of obnoxious school kids, one bad script+directing combo, bake it only halfway, and sprinkle some very light horror on top of it? You get a poorly made south-korean ""pop hit"" with overinflated reviews. I realize that south-korean drama has a different formula, a different flair to it, when compared to other countries' , but this just feels like Korean Bollywood. Sometimes, it feels like a Japanese advert director was giving ""pro tips"" off-camera."
5444,All of Us Are Dead,"Just your typical zombie movies like the ones in West, too much drama stupidity and no logic. They even say have you watch the movie Train to Busan? And still not learn anything from it, the police and soldiers aren't even using guns in the beginning episodes."
5445,All of Us Are Dead,This was amazing! I actually enjoyed this series more than Squid Game! Everything was perfectly timed. A lot of the characters had development and grew throughout the series. Wonderful! Can't wait for season 2!
5446,All of Us Are Dead,"I found this to be boring nonsense. The zombie scenes are well done hence a rating of 2 and not 1.It is a bunch of immature stupid children stuck in a school during a zombie apocolypse and all they do is cry and argue and keep saying ""it's all my fault"" except for one who keeps saying ""it's all your fault""."
5447,All of Us Are Dead,"Well yes there are some plot hole in this series but yeah idk I didn't care at all LOL
The tension and thrilling moments are so good and fun, I just enjoy when watch this series.Namra is the coolest and my favorite character in here. I keep watching this because of her. She's so brave and calm and wow...just cool. The love story between Namra and Suhyeok is my favorite scene. I NEED THE SEASON 2 ASAP!"
5448,All of Us Are Dead,"Acting was sub par even for a teenage Korean series. The female lead has exactly one expression. All characters behave in the most irrational ways possible. The whole refugee camp arc has nothing to do with anything at all. The pace of the series was so slow and nonsensical that you can skip most of the boring, script-reading scenes."
5449,All of Us Are Dead,"It's not even good, yet people rate higher than 1 star. Slow pacing, lots if unecessary dialogue, conflicts were forced, and mutations were so random. I love zombie movies, but this is just meh. Wasted my time. Skipped through every single episode just to get to the ""good"" parts."
5450,All of Us Are Dead,"This show is so different from every other zombies movie or series, It's very interesting how the virus works which we find out later, the virus was supposed to help the weak, it's not just that but I won't say too much but it's so interesting and it's not some stupid action movie, and it breaks a lot of stereotypes of tv series, and the best thing is the characters know how zombies work, it's so meta. It's rlly good."
5451,All of Us Are Dead,"So, original ideas have apparently vanished. This show is pretty much a live action Korean version of the anime: high school of the dead. It's just, Meh! Has none of the originality and entertainment value of the original. Very disappointed."
5452,All of Us Are Dead,Typical Zombie episodic show. They could have done this very well with a 2 hour movie skipping a lot of the unnecessary character subplots which were way too long. They even reference a Zombie flick Train to Busan. Acting for the most part was very good as well as the location shooting.
5453,All of Us Are Dead,"She is half zombie she isn't affected by zombies. She never went to grab them supplies or food or water, she never goes ahead and clean the path from zombies. She is always running with them like she has anything to be afraid off
Also , why the zombies head never pop all of them are like superman they keep beefing them but nothing happens."
5454,All of Us Are Dead,"The series hooks a lot, in realism with which everything happens from the emotional reactions,
government strategies and reaction is very well written.It is one of the few zombie series or movies that I have seen where the protagonists do not start doing illogical nonsense.On the other hand, the level of acting is very good and the staging of some scenes is at another level."
5455,All of Us Are Dead,"I love everything zombie. Everything. But the majority of characters in this are so damn stupid, unlikeable, selfish or just plain evil. I spent the whole series wishing they'd get eaten or turned because of how terrible most of the characters are. There was a couple of good ones. But the students you're meant to root for are just kind of awful and annoying.Great effects and some great acting, but the characters are so... blah. I suppose that's the point though. Humans don't really deserve to survive since they suck so much. True in a way."
5456,All of Us Are Dead,"The show starts, in netflix-esque fashion, with a event that would never happen like that in a natural situation. This show boils down to overdrawn characters and teenagers being teenagers. Don't waste your time on this fine looking but poor written piece."
5457,All of Us Are Dead,"I like that type of movies, but I couldnt stand this one, was watching with my wife, but we stopped at 2 episode, as it was simply boring.You can give it a try if you are desperate to watch anything."
5458,All of Us Are Dead,"I really don't understand how anyone can rate this above a 5. It's awful: unrealistic script, bad acting, amateur directing. The zombies are pathetic with their contortions and clicking sound effects. Another reviewer said it should be called We are all stupid. Most poignant comment ever on this embarrassing series. The rotten tomatoes rating doesn't reflect the critics reviews. Don't waste your time."
5459,All of Us Are Dead,Well made series....it is best zombies film/webseries till date...full of emotion ride and characters love...all characters are extraordinary...I mention one actor (who played Chong San) his acting was brillent . I am fan this chracter...but all cast are preety good....story are so fabulous ( zombies in school) 👍👍
5460,All of Us Are Dead,"I know these people were just thrown into a zombie apocalypse but there are just decisions some of these characters make that just require common sense.Example: if you see the privileged loner girl wiping blood off a mop handle, SAY SOMETHING before she uses it to infect one of her own.Also who cares about honorifics and courtesy during an attack on your schoolAnd then there is Cheong-su's mom, who braves Hyosan to try to get to her child and get through many infected except she doesn't realize one of his friends is infected and stupidly calls out to him."
5461,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm amazed how many of you are saying that is a great zombie idea.I'll tell you is NOT.First episode started well and then when infection strikes all of the students started to play too dumb, their reaction is not realistic at all, when you see zombies coming to you, you simply run like hell not playing around the zombie crowdAfter 5 minutes of second episode I said NO. It' not worth my time."
5462,All of Us Are Dead,"Talking about the positives the series has good characters, story, suspence and a new type of zombies that can be called as half zombies. The show is suspenseful from beginning to the end and won't really bore you cause there are many interesting events that happen in each episode that makes you wanna watch the next episode. However the show is quite repetitive in terms of the zombie encounters and the way they deal with the zombies sometimes is both senseless and impractical. Also the show uses quite a few ""fake"" Encounters and incidents to lure the audience to the next episode. The climax of the show is good but it leaves a lot of questions that needs to be answered but at the same time it seems unnecessary to make another season just to answer those questions cause those questions aren't that interesting to make people wanna watch another season. Overall it's a good way to pass your free time."
5463,All of Us Are Dead,"I really liked the first few episodes of this show, and throughout it I continued to think the setting was great and the performances ranged from good to great. The writing, though, is just the laziest, hackiest garbage imaginable. It basically requires every single character to do the dumbest possible thing at any given time, with little to any justification, just so the showrunners can get to another set piece or action scene. That's lazy writing and the rest of the show (and the audience) deserves better."
5464,All of Us Are Dead,"And... I have seen a lot. The thrill and action with which this series kept me latched to episode after episode - I loved it.The cast did great acting, became a fan of a few actors. Screenplay was amazing, editing was crisp, the zombies were believable (quintessential zombies) and it is worth a second season. I hope to see the characters again.Great job team ""all of us are dead"""
5465,All of Us Are Dead,"Don't give up after 2-3 episodes.I'm not a huge fan of the genre, and I skimmed through a lot of chase scenes because they get to be a bit repetitive.However, I found myself enjoying this show more and more. While there are familiar tropes from past zombie show playbooks, there are plenty of new things in the show that have kept me engaged throughout."
5466,All of Us Are Dead,"Now I loved TWD in the early seasons but after the departure of glen then Carl and the final straw Rick it became boring and soap opera so after seeing the trailer for all of us are dead I was intrigued into wether this could fill my zombie void and I'm glad to say it did,this series had some great new takes on the zombie virus and executed them well the story can become slow paced at times but the effects stunts and action is a joy to watch,12 1 hour episodes is a long stretch but I enjoyed most of it and shall look forward to season 2."
5467,All of Us Are Dead,"Unfortunately for me, I watched this show until the end and I can confidently say that it has almost no redeeming quality. Seriously, whoever is in charge with the plot and characters is either really bad in their job or want to troll the audiences.The plot is really bad. They created some interesting characters and then gave them no character development or gave them a lot of backstories and then killed them off before they can do anything. (To Cheong San's mom : are you really going to approach your son's classmate casually even when he 100% look like a zombie? Like for real?)That being said, the characters are idiots. We see various characters fight off zombies in 12 episodes and more often than not they tried to do it with bare hands like in a school gang fight. Makeshift weapons and things that are essential for survival like food and water? Oh no, they don't have time for that. Love confessions, love rectangles, and holding hands singing kumbaya are more important. They need a pc to search for information about outside world? Chuck it to the zombies even when the room is full with other things. Someone pissed you off because your other friends like them more than you? Kill him, who need more believable reason?Yes, this show pissed me off. The 3 stars is for the archer girl, Ha Ri, who's still an idiot but a cool idiot."
5468,All of Us Are Dead,"I enjoyed the story and the acting, but the casting for the English dubbing was awful and really distracted me from what my eyes were seeing.Every voice sounded like a well-spoken 20-somethings. No matter who the on-screen character was, they all sounded the same - young or old, good upbringing or not. The kids didn't sound like schools kids, they all sounded like posh 20-something Yale or Harvard students."
5469,All of Us Are Dead,"This show is about as bad and nonsensical as ""Train to Busan"". It's another storyline for people who don't mind having every element spoonfed to them through tropes and stereotypes. It offers no new takes on zombies, Korea's bullying culture, cheesey romantic crushes, or the ability of those in charge to take action rather than cover up an issue. If you're looking for a quality zombie story, this will be 14 hours of your life misspent. It's almost as bad as ""Z Nation"" but without the failed attempts at humor."
5470,All of Us Are Dead,"Was gonna give this a 9 but when the dad sacrificed himself for his daughter at the tennis court, I had had enough of the terrible writing of this show. There was no reason for that."
5471,All of Us Are Dead,"Central to the plot is a horrific theme of constant and brutal bullying, which is not only disturbing, miserable and frustrating to watch, but is the least creative subplot conceivable for a high school drama. I can't imagine how anyone could muscle through a viewing of the whole season, but I intend to spare myself the pain of a second episode."
5472,All of Us Are Dead,"The red haired girl was annoying!!! I just had to say that first. Also, they are teenagers so they do stupid stuff like scream at each other and fight one another during a zombie apocalypse. There's also some pretty intense scenes that can cause some emotions like the little child running from her mom. Whew. That was intense. Overall it was a great series and no one was safe including the main characters."
5473,All of Us Are Dead,"This is one of best zombie series I have ever seen, I love the South Korean take on the zombie genre. Extremely well done makeup and special effects and refreshingly unique story line."
5474,All of Us Are Dead,"1. When everyone comes down from the classroom through a hosepipe, then the end of the hosepipe is only up to the window, but later in some scenes that pipe is shown from the window to the bottom.2. When everyone starts a campfire on the rooftop, On-jo is sitting with a blanket. While there was no blanket on the roof, where did she get it from?3. From the same window from which i-sak falls, everyone comes down through the pipe, but in a single scene, the dead body of her and zombie i-sak is not shown.4. In episode eleven, when Nam-ra feels hungry outside the construction site, she bites her hand. And in episode twelve, when she is separated due to hunger in the city, she bites her hand again, at that time the mark of the previous bite is not in her hand."
5475,All of Us Are Dead,"If you're a fan of zombie show and won't care about the quality/plot or any details - sure go for it.Also if you're new to Korean shows and want to watch something go ahead
However, if you're someone who watches shows for the plot, direction, cinematography, stunts then I'd say this one was so disappointing.It looked great when the trailer was out. I was actually excited but the show is below average for me. The camera work was sloppy. Looks like it was shot way back in 2000 or the techniques they used were quite outdated not sure about that (still there were good shows with good quality before 2000s. So clearing that )
Background score is really not appropriate - it doesn't sync with most of the scenes. Usually Koreans shows have amazing OST's or background scores.The plot is terrible - Same typical plot (both school/zombie) there's nothing new plus they tried to fit everything in the plot that it felt more of a school drama than zombie school drama
This may be a low budget show but still I've seen better shows with low budget!Anyway all I want to say is rather than watching this show and wasting time on it. Please watch Happiness (its of same genre but the plot is amazing - overall an epic show ) and thank me later 😋
This is coming from a person who watched countless number of Korean shows and is tired of basic plots - so don't be offended if you liked the show. Since, most of the reviews are misleading to someone like me I just wanted to put it out there."
5476,All of Us Are Dead,"Despite all the horror, violence, blood and human entrails typical of zombie movies this story is really beautiful.True love and sacrifice, real friendship and team work and hope till the end. Characters both heroes and villains are very original, not super humans, super strong, super smart or super evil and emotionally unstable, nothing is exaggerated (which cannot be said about most of the recent productions where we simply see freaks, even protagonists). Compered to adults depicted in this story teenagers look more human in face of danger and despair and their strenght is not in their brains or muscles but in their hearts. Simple story and simple message nothing new but well told.Young Korean actors done really well. On-jo her character show us how delicate and infantile, maybe even weak person could be really strong and pure in the same time. The child and the adult in one person - teenager. All the rest are brilliant and original either.10/10 because this story is entertaining and smart, scary and touching, funny and sad, simple and yet deep and complex in the same time.In between high masterpiece and really bad movies lays the real cinema."
5477,All of Us Are Dead,"Budget looks good to make a well zombie tv season but what lacks is the direction and story telling! No focus on a single character and the character which they focus on are useless and get executed, giving a useless story telling and screenplay. Didn't feel any adrenaline rush or scare. No powerful character, gets boring in between. Expected more from this high budget Netflix series and Korean drama."
5478,All of Us Are Dead,"It's a disgusting series A lot of blood, and used concept.If it was in 2012 it would have been much better.I wish they came up with a new idea.///////////////"
5479,All of Us Are Dead,"This TV series is very good. I just loved it. Every character played their role very effectively. I really enjoyed watching this masterpiece. Though it is a zombie movie, there are many scenes which might be disturbing for some viewers but if you are interested in these type of genre, you will fall in love with this. Story is very interesting, direction is super, cinematography is next level. A series full of thriller, horror, comedy, drama, emotions everything. It consists of 12 episodes and each episode is approximately of 1 hour. But i in these 12 hours, you won't find it boring."
5480,All of Us Are Dead,"I fell in love with this movie from the 1st time watching the 1st episode. I got hook-up with the plot and finished this series within only 2 days. 9 episodes on the 1st day and 3 episodes the following day.Credit to all the hard work and the creative art presented in this series. I must say, exceptional acting, excellent directorship, great casting, cinematography, videography, deep script, editing, and the make-up artist are all incredibly appreciable.The storyline started to get intense from the beginning till the end. The crisis is presented in the form of the zombies caused by the Jonas virus.I love how they presented various characters of human beings when facing a crisis, and in this case, it is between life & death.Selfishness & selflessness are conveyed meticulously in every character. The human survival instinct influences human action, especially in the end, where the human-centric point of view decides to save humanity from extinction and sacrifices other beings as collateral damage.I love how every crucial message and critical learning are conveyed to the viewers. The issues with inequality treatment, bullies, minorities, politics, fear, bold, and proactive were included.I can't wait for the 2nd season to come. I did watch other zombie TV series, but none are this great after Train to Busan."
5481,All of Us Are Dead,"Only 4 episodes in, its very dramatic but fun moments and zombie attacks everywhere, gonna keep continue watching this, any zombie lover and korean series watchers would love this one."
5482,All of Us Are Dead,"I started this show with very high hopes, as it's first episodes shown well done Zombie action. The makeup was really great, the effects were cool, and overall, everything Zombie related was pretty well done. And although that persisted throughout the episodes, I must say that it's script is, sadly, one of the stupidest, worst written and most obnoxious ones I've watched in a long time.Every time, every single time, a character opened their mouth or made any kind of decision, I just wished for all the cast to be eaten by zombies right then and there. Every single death from this first season was due not to the zombies themselves, but to every single character in the show having less common sense than a rock. Characters made the worst decisions they could have for every single scenario.This became extremely obnoxious half through the season, and the last two chapters I just straight skipped dialogue scenes because I couldn't bear to watch more of the plot.The zombies are cool tho, so if you are a fan of the genre, I guess it's still enjoyable to some extent. Just be prepared for the plot."
5483,All of Us Are Dead,"The storyline is ok, it points out bullying, cruelty of humans, but some of characters are just too stupid.They just stand there, not reacting every time there is an attack, especially the girls.Only the girl with an arrow knows how to kill the zombies, the rest just carry useless weapons like long sticks, and the annoying thing is most of them don't use it to aim the head (come on it's a zombie 🙄)-Useless death for some characters to make it more dramatic and sad.Poor decisions of characters that make you annoyed to death."
5484,All of Us Are Dead,"Preety bruatual show
Zombies are good
Storyline is good
Everything is good.Ithink all charaters are developed really awesomly in entire run.Those of u who are complainig
That else i was into and i am lost
I say now is trash and its a not good show iwould say only only one word for them f$$ck off
No why u guys are really dumb
Enjoy the fu$$king show and let creaters get the recognition they deserve."
5485,All of Us Are Dead,Good story but they don't rally dragged it out. Chronic overuse of the people running and falling. I don't think Koreans are as inept at running as they portray. My gosh not one person could run without stumbling.
5486,All of Us Are Dead,I tried to give this a chance but gave up half way through the third episode. The majority of characters are just annoying and why would you lock yourself in a room rather than try to get out of the school and make it for the high ground. Plus when they are faced with a Zombie why not just throw them out of that 4th floor window instead of using stools to try and pin them against a wall? It's just one bad decision after the other and seems the director just stretched it out by having meaningless teenager drama. I just hope the lot of them were turned into Zombies.
5487,All of Us Are Dead,"One of the best netflix series. Why I really love it because of scenes which we never saw in american pop-corn movies. Like the best characters, whom we love from hearth, they also die (some of them). The evil is relativized. Also there are astonishing secrets, which we (viewers) know, but in the series, the characters never find out. You never know what will happens, full of surprises. Also the best in this series, there aren't any force moral lessons. The things just happens, and you cannot say, what is good and what is bad behaviour, just like in real life."
5488,All of Us Are Dead,"It starts out corny, predictable, bad scripting (or English Translations), and the students making absolutely horrible decisions, or not thinking of or ignoring obvious solutions, but it is entertaining enough to get you to episode 3/4 and then things get so much better. You actually care about the characters and there is some great acting, even through some of the pretty terrible English Translations and tones used by the voice over ""actors.""It is a very good series. You will be entertained. I do hope we get a season 2. This was up there with Squid Games for me as I got further into it, minus the mental illness of Squid Games lol."
5489,All of Us Are Dead,"Another master piece of Korean Zombie movies. After Train to Bushan this is a take to live the struggle to live. Average 12 hours are worth giving. All characters did strong enough to wait for next season. Among all this kind of movies realizes us that what is different to be a human. Relationship, family and friends. The sacrifices which worth to keep your beloved breathing.LOVED the 12 hours waiting for another."
5490,All of Us Are Dead,"Series named as adult drama but incidents happening from school. But teenages acted as matured adults. Faults are though; I feel some unnecessary feelings injected on the 2nd or 3rd episode of the series. 7 kids vs atleast 60 powerful zombies in a classroom with a barricade. Actress's dad entry is not satisfying. They skipped so fast. Incubation period varies from 2 seconds to 1 week... Why?Otherwise overall series is a good... Cinematography, casting and making of the series are one of the best in industry. I have just 7 questions suggestions about the series that is I mentioned above."
5491,All of Us Are Dead,"I really looked forward to this Kdrama, I'm a huge fan of Korean shows and as always i'm thankful that I started watching this. I think I have it a 8/10 because I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies or series but after all it was really good."
5492,All of Us Are Dead,Pleasee this series was made too cheesy like kids from high school with childish mindset and the main character was so arghhhhhh made me so feel bad..and the zombie like un natural.
5493,All of Us Are Dead,"I liked every thing about it besides watching zombies chasing people down a school hall for the 12,000th time! It still kept me interested and invested in the story but sometimes it did feel like a slog. Could probably have cut two episodes worth of zombies running around."
5494,All of Us Are Dead,"The friendship and their loyalty was the best thing that the show represents. When it comes to movie between life and death and you want the actors to make the best decision instead of irritating and selfish ones well this is it.Ive never been so satisfied with the characters and their decisions. Their loyalty, love, perseverance and tolerance. Each character brings so much presence in their own right.On the plus side. Park Solomon is easy on the eyes. And so are the rest. But he shines like never before."
5495,All of Us Are Dead,"... but not in a good way. Three episodes in and I'm tired of the students making horrible decisions. From standing around while another student turns, tolerating another entitled student, settling on a classroom on another floor when there were plenty on the way to choose from, putting your fellow students and friends in danger by not disclosing that you've been bitten to feeling depressed in the middle of it all when you should feel a sense of urgency. They say that if you can't be a model by showing others how they should do things, be an example by showing others how they shouldn't do things. This series falls into the latter category. The only redeeming thing so far is that there is a fighter and a thinker in the group. Everybody else is, pretty much, useless and a liability. ""#Alive"" and ""Train to Busan"" were more comprehensive. They had their flaws, but not to the extent of this series."
5496,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm halfway through the series ""All of Us Are Dead"" and say it's a win for zombie aficionados everywhere. Like most flicks of its kind it makes you wonder, was humanity already brain dead well before the apocalypse hit?There's a nice subtheme going on related to exam hell and the fact that students in Korea come out of 12 years of education with virtually no skills beyond those required for test-taking and punching fingers at SmartPhones.When watching this I can't help think of the Sewol Ferry and how a paucity of critical thinking skills was at least a contributing factor to that completely avoidable tragedy. I have a feeling it was very much in the minds of the creators as well.I have a personal connection with Andong, where much of the movie was filmed, having spent 7 years teaching at the national university there. As a side note, on several occasions I tried to get my students on-board terrorizing the community with a zombie night in lieu of something called English Education night, a series of demanding performances which everybody seemed to loathe. This was way before zombie mania hit Korea in the form of ""Train to Busan"" and, now, ""All of Us Are Dead."""
5497,All of Us Are Dead,"I really liked this show. The actors were casted very well to their roles. The story was quite realistic as well as the characters' reactions, decisions and their zest for action following the outbreak. It was nice to see all of the characters evolve with the situation. 2 points deduction because someone fell every single time they ran somewhere and because of this annoying unkillable character."
5498,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm on episode 6 and I'm hooked because of the drama with strong sociopolitical messages, not because of the zombies.And Yes...it's long, but who cares? Why you want it to finish it so fast? Take a chill pill and be grateful it's as long as it is good too.Also, for the animals that complain about having filler, guess what?, fillers are intended for character development and world-building support."
5499,All of Us Are Dead,"As a big consumer of zombie subgenere, I always look for new stuff, and I really enjoied this one. However, it must be seen in korean and with subtitles, otherwise, it's boring."
5500,All of Us Are Dead,"I don't think I ever watched a zombie drama series that shook me, stressed me, saddened me and literally traumatized me as this one. The greatest zombie drama series of all time. Bravo, South Korea! You've got my respect!The actors? They really managed to show the angst and desperation of the characters do perfectly. Tje development of the characters is so well done it's almost unrral. It's like if they even exit the screen.The direction? Absoloutley bananas!The screenplay? The most fascinating writing of all time.The music? Haunting and provocative. Really adds to the atmosphere of the series.I can't wait for Season 2 to come out, can't wait to see more of the characters I now love."
5501,All of Us Are Dead,"Cons : Probably just my own preference but, i cant stand teenager acting, and even with decent time for character development, they still cant make me to care about them.Pros : if you dont expect great acting or memorable character/story and only try to find decent zombie movie/tv-series, its watchable.They should put the drama genre down, its far from train to busan, even if its only 2 hours movie, the character development better than this."
5502,All of Us Are Dead,But all of the characters are soo insanely stupid. That mom on the scooter lol. None of them are making any sense and the zombies cant break glass for whatever reason?
5503,All of Us Are Dead,"The story is very generic, predictable and monotonous. There isn't much going on except for a few scenes of violence. The zombies are okay, the humans are as dumb as you can expect them to be in a zombie movie, I would say even dumber than most movies. They fight among themselves, they have a tendency to exhibit wisdom after the event. Their actions don't make any sense at all. All in all, this is a very long and tedious watch. Don't waste your time like I did."
5504,All of Us Are Dead,"Although I am almost 50 I really enjoyed this series. The Korean have proven they ate great story tellers and can do it with smaller budget. But what I really liked is the healthy
ethical and sensible message. And of course it's a bit over the top but to make a point you have to be more clear. The story uses the zombies to get the point across but it could have easily a war situation it's the same thing. How in desperate times you need to come toghether. How vanities and personal loss take an other place in your ego. How friendship is michorw fragile than a social media post. How it feels if you let thing be unset. How everybody deals with stuff differently."
5505,All of Us Are Dead,"How are people giving it high ratings. It just makes no sense.I read some of the disapproving reviews and I pretty much agree with them but a couple of things I would like to point out that nobody's taking about.1st is that how the hell did a teenage girl went through 9 months of pregnancy and no one noticed.2nd is that how did they go about fighting zombies, jumping up and down buildings and such without consuming any food whatsoever.I mean I get the fear for your life and adrenaline rush and all that but still you can't go on like that for days without food."
5506,All of Us Are Dead,"Over all I believe it's a well done series.One thing I did notice that was completely wrong was the students debating the meaning of the distress signal S-O-S. They are debating this in the episode where they're on the school roof top. The female student who's father was an EMT says that SOS doesn't mean anything, that it's not an acronym. It does in fact stand for SAVE OUR SHIP.Not sure the writers can get more than one series out of this. Just my opinion."
5507,All of Us Are Dead,Relation between Korean Series & Zombies are always great.. Love to watch this show. I've completed almost 50% of episodes. And this is very awesome 👍 I like it... Koreans really know how to make movies & series with a lot of emotions... Want more content like this 😁
5508,All of Us Are Dead,"When it's come to South Korea series, There's always fans who voted 10/10 instantly.Some character is annoying as hell with no backup reason. Some character can be so dumb in one scene, and be so smart in the next scene.If you don't like to watch series with a bunch of stupid decisions and stupid plot, you will not enjoy this series.Btw, I'm actually a South-Korea Series fan, but not this one."
5509,All of Us Are Dead,"They just scape of the dead using doors and windows against the zombies..., everyone is screaming and eating each other alive..., they are covered in blood....And the only thing that they do is to talk about date each other.Yes I lost 2h of my life watching and they will not came back."
5510,All of Us Are Dead,"This is how a zombie series is made really. It was soo good, it got me hooked from the very start. The characters were just too good. The decisions considering their age seems justified. But some scenes were very comical, and stupid but those can be easily overlooked because I loved this."
5511,All of Us Are Dead,"The series is very wonderful and luxury, it is full of action, mystery and zombies, it was as if I lived the atmosphere like them, here I learned the value of teamwork and how to survive without food or drink."
5512,All of Us Are Dead,"Survivors are ignoring their instincts. Characters' deeds are not logical. For the eleven episodes, no one decided to make a weapon to fight zombies. I watched that with embarrassment. Good CGI, though. If you like movies where people only run from place to place, mainly doing stupid things on the way, this one is definitely for you. Great potential lost miserably."
5513,All of Us Are Dead,"If you're a fan of the Zombie genre then you should enjoy this. Good mix of character development, gore and thrills.If you're looking for something to watch and a fan of the genre then this will be right up your alley."
5514,All of Us Are Dead,You know korea has made many amazing zombies movies and they never disappoint us. This movie is also one of the best zombies. You should definitely try this.
5515,All of Us Are Dead,"A lot of k-drama fans too supportive about all k-dramas but this is kinda disappointed and STUPID. I'm sorry but usually Korean actors are great but in this series it's so embarrassing and awkward, storyline is stupid and even the zombie is faster but the story is too slow. 12 episodes of NONSENSE."
5516,All of Us Are Dead,"What a story... It's marvellous every episode is very interesting and very emotional when someone turned into zombies.. Especially your favourite characters... Hatts off such an exciting, engaging, n thriller story...wait for season 2."
5517,All of Us Are Dead,I do like this show alot for what it is. The plot is engaging and emotional and the action scenes are exciting I just have one problem with it that was frequent throughout. If you're one of those people that hate when people make dumb decisions in scary movies you will agree with me here. There is way too much standing around when people should be running away.. and does somebody have to coincidentally fall down every time they are running to add suspense? If someone you know gets bitten do you really need to stand there and cry for 5 min while zombies are actively chasing you. Just so many situations where common sense in a survival situation is just thrown out the window and it just kills me sometimes lol. But besides that I'd say this is overall a good zombie show and despite my criticisms I still binge watched the whole thing as apparently I still wanted to see more/what would happen next.
5518,All of Us Are Dead,"I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie."
5519,All of Us Are Dead,"I think it's a well-made zombie movie. Since South Korea is a country where civilians are illegal to have guns, there is no such coolness to shoot and kill like ordinary zombie movies, but I think the tension from the situation where there is no specific way to respond was the best."
5520,All of Us Are Dead,"I have seen enough of this, from Train to Busan, Kingdom, and now this. Same scenery where there is Zombie rampage, massive zombies chasing
Human by running away for their lives...after the second episode, I stopped watching it."
5521,All of Us Are Dead,Overrated to be honest. The best zombie kdrama is still the original KINGDOM! Nothing new to see here ... for 2022 there is other drama that is worth to watch than this. Definitely a No and will not waste my time watching this.
5522,All of Us Are Dead,"This is such an accurate and credible zombie apocalypse . Some of the bad points are that THEY KEEP TRIPPING AND FALLING, how they survived without such low amount of food and water and how they could've saved more people. Other than those ,this this Korean gore genre and absolutely loved the deaths, sacrifices and suspence."
5523,All of Us Are Dead,"Too excited for this show and maybe that was why I was disappointed. Non stop watched to ep. 3 trying to get into the storyline and characters, and although it gets better after each episodes, both storyline and characters so far are unremarkable. Too many holes in the plot, timeline all wrong.. Some of the main characters are so annoying that I rooted for the zombies.Nevertheless, the zombies are great and it is definitely entertaining so I would grudgingly finish watching this."
5524,All of Us Are Dead,"Headline says it all.What's the connection of the pregnant woman? Just to show a teenage child who got pregnant and still tried to save her child? I don't get it, the girl didn't even have connection to the main characters though.Second, the scene where rat(?)/ hamster(?) came near to onjo's feet,what does it mean? Does her blood is the cure to the disease? Overly used.You can notice unnecessary scenes if you are paying attention to the main point of the events. Also, characters is kinda NO NO for me."
5525,All of Us Are Dead,The first episode was difficult to watch due to bullying and sexual assault. To begin with the story draws you in and you want the characters to be able survive the zombies apocalypse.As the story continued the characters stories are all intertwined from a horrific event. The overall question became will theses characters be able to survive each other and zombies.
5526,All of Us Are Dead,"A different kind of zombie story with good actors and lots of goore, but suffers from inconsistence wrighting.Interesting plot, realistic science and creative tactics.Stupid characters, ridiculous logical decisions and lots of plot holes.All in all a show i recommend to watch, if you can stand people screaming all the time while still trying to hide from flesheating zombies attracted to sound."
5527,All of Us Are Dead,"I had high hopes for this one, but I am disappointed after watching one episode. The scriptwriter had to make the characters act so stupidly and make a bunch of dumb decisions so the story could go on. The storyline is cliche and not believable. The only positive thing I can say about this is they are trying to raise awareness of bullying, which is a common issue in Korean society."
5528,All of Us Are Dead,"It made me feel that it was something really fresh from the genre.Before delving into why I thought it was good, let's stop for a second to remove the basic prejudice about zombie movies.A lot of people are saying it's yet the old zombie trope and same old thing again. ""Characters trying to survive and dying one by one."" But I don't think it is fair to compare or judge it that way.It's like saying oh this action movie is about characters fighting, then other action movies including characters fighting cannot be good. Or this drama is about a character's life story then other dramas about other characters lives' story is not innovative because both are telling life stories about a character.I am a huge zombie fan, and have watch most of the zombie shows/movies.Obviously the premise is the normal zombie premise but what made the show differentiate from the rest, is the other elements added into it such as character depths, morals, love, hope, hate and friendship. There are characters that will make you laugh, cheer for, like, hate and also get annoyed at. Which in itself is a success because it made you feel that way.It also had twist and turns that are not used in many other zombie flicks. And I have to say as an avid zombie veteran, I was taken by surprise more than a handful of scenes. (Which is not easy at all since I have seen most of them.) And if it managed to make you immediately want to click on the next episode to see what happens next, it has also succeeded.Yes, it got it's bad moments sometimes, can be slow, stupid decisions are made and also a few plot holes. But those are forgiven in the grander scheme of things. The cinematography was beautiful, zombies really well made, acting was amazing by such young actors and action sequences realistically done. And again, in this ""overdone"" genre it managed to be fresh from the rest and made me think about it after the credits were rolling. For a zombie series, it deserved a 10 for me."
5529,All of Us Are Dead,"Is by far the best thing about this show, that kid was a legend! Ha.Was actually routing for him in this......but I can't figure out how the squid game girl looks about 10 years younger in this ?"
5530,All of Us Are Dead,I do love watching anything Korean and zombies thrown into the mix was a bonus I really enjoyed it was was glued to the TV all day. Ignore the negative comments and give it a try and then decide for yourself. 😉😊
5531,All of Us Are Dead,"I went in with high hopes, as I'm a fan of just about everything zombie, especially South Korean. I wasn't really feeling it after the first couple episodes (maybe 6 stars), but as the characters and story developed it got significantly better. I was hooked by the end of it. Would have probably given it an 8 had it started as strongly as it finished, so I'm splitting the difference with a 7."
5532,All of Us Are Dead,So if you have 10 hrs to waste approx you can go ahead and watch this series just meaningless waste of time. After all this hype and korean drama suppose to be good.doesnt come even near our expectation.lame plot its like a loop same thing happening again and again.with same character.not a woth watch.
5533,All of Us Are Dead,"People are running and tripping in such clumsy way that I ruins the show. Many things does not make sense, to much illogical activities. But better than TWD at least."
5534,All of Us Are Dead,"My favourite zombie series is Kingdom and train to Busan is far better than most western made zombie movies. Also Squid Game was very good, however, that does not mean that everything from Korea will be awesome and that we should like it just because of that.All of us are dead is not good not bad, it has some interesting scenes, yet it feels that it should not have been 12 episodes... same issue that the walking dead had when people would rave about how ""deep"" the characters were, when in reality they did just have a lot of unnecessary dialogue and filler content that do not give the characters anything.I found myself skipping through by the end.Oh yes and one of the bullies is overdone on how many times he comes back.. it just annoyed me by that point.It is meh in one word."
5535,All of Us Are Dead,"It was ok to watch but incredibly stupid descisions made me fast forward a lot. People sacrificing themselves unnecessarily or someone seemingly forgets there's a zombie apocalypse, or how about telling a carrier off he virus ""the next time you feel the urge to eat someone, eat me!""
Military personnel shooting themselves AFTER beating the zombie outbreak (success=suicide?).Also, EVERYONE know how to kill a zombie, you mess up the brain. Still, everyone with a blunt weapon go for the arms or the back or the legs. I can go on and on and on, the show is incredibly dumb a lot of the time, making me facepalm and press fast forward. Even though all of this it was ok to watch. Just ok.(I like zombie stuff in general)"
5536,All of Us Are Dead,"When I first started watching this show I was interested in the plot. The first few episodes were really promising, like something big was going to come in the future. Well that never came. After the first half of the show, it became stale and the main characters took every wrong decision possible without any reason at all, which led to them getting killed of.Another thing that bothered me is that the main characters ignored the fact that the zombies could be killed by stabbing them to the neck, although some of them did it a lot of times. I mean like nobody said ""Hey the zombies can be killed by stabbing them to the neck, maybe we should just kill them instead of pushing them"".Good try but not enough. 6/10."
5537,All of Us Are Dead,"First of all, the effects are good, even though the idea or the plot itself is not original, still an interesting premise to watch. HOWEVER, the characters are unlikeable, so many inconsistent things happened, the more you watch the plot is getting messier, so many dumb actions performed by the characters, like what? Wasting 15 seconds to shot a terrified face for each student while they can actually just throw the zombie out fast is dumb, really dumb. The love triangle doesn't even help with the characters chemistry. So yeah, disappointing."
5538,All of Us Are Dead,"I don't get those people giving bad reviews about All of us Are Dead! I enjoyed every episode from start to finish. It never loses its momentum. In fact, 12 episodes to me are not that long. I am hoping for a season 2.This show covers everything relevant to societal issues like the pandemic, bullying, political influence, pressure of getting into college, family relationships, friendship, love, human behaviours. I love how they included the youtuber character because he's not just for comedy but it's a reality that people would do stupid thing just for social media views.I like how they got into detail of the origin of the virus and the mechanism of the virus. Most zombie movies don't go into detail with the origin of the virus (usually it's chemical spill and things like that).Each episode keeps you wanting more and the actors played their parts perfectly. The female protagonist, On-Jo is a very realistic character. She's not one of those badass superhero frontal heroine but like most of us, she's an ordinary girl who has to deal with the pain of losing loved ones and yet keep going for the ones who are still alive.This show isn't just about surviving or killing zombies. It shows you every human relationship. In this show, although they show you how cruel humans can be, it also highlights the good side of humans and how one is willing to sacrifice for the good of others.The side stories are all put together very well, without spoiling the main plot. I disagree with the comments saying there are too many unnecessary plots or characters because every side story has an impact and every character has a story to tell.Plot wise, acting wise, visuals, effects, everything is phenomenal. 10/10 absolutely!"
5539,All of Us Are Dead,I really don't understand the logic behind all of these good reviews. Only watched two episodes and I couldn't find myself to finish the rest. The concept was good but watching a show where all the characters are dumb af is extremely aggravating and makes you want to throw the remote at the screen. Every character makes stupid decisions and just stands there and does nothing the entire time. This show was a joke. Nothing compared to the masterpiece of train to Busan.
5540,All of Us Are Dead,"It actually started off great. Interesting characters, very creative cinematography, and great acting. But as the show went on, it got dumber and dumber with plot holes, bad writing, inconsistencies and things that just don't make sense. I was hoping this would be a Korean 'series', along the likes of Kingdom, Extracurricular, Stranger, Squid Game to name a few. But instead it's just a 'K-drama' with zombies. To give credit where credit is due; the acting for the most part is excellent. The cinematography (at least in the earlier episodes) is very creative, especially the one take sequence in episode 2. The stunts by everyone (especially the zombie actors) is incredible and the action choreography is excellent. Just wish it was written and directed better."
5541,All of Us Are Dead,"At first I thought it's.just another zombie tv series, after I watched a couple episodes, I found it's more than just blood, fight scenes. It goes deep into humanity, friendship and family, the good hearted contracts with evils. And the emotional journey it takes you through is just astonishing, especially when a father tries to save his daughter and sacrifices his own life, a mother rushes into the danger zone just to see if her son is ok, a son sees his own mother turned into a zombie and tries to bite him and fights with his classmates not to hit his mother, the humanity and the emotional journey resonated with me and I'm sure it would resonate with any one who has a family."
5542,All of Us Are Dead,"There's some really fun zombie action in here. The way they turn is violent and well-made, and camera and sound are great! That is about it though.The dialogue is mostly a cringe fest, the decisions the characters make are even too dumb for high schoolers and the story is slow and just really meh.There's also some attempts at humour, but those shots mostly miss, like 99% of the time.Can't recommend, except if you have absolutely nothing else to watch."
5543,All of Us Are Dead,"The first 3 episodes i wasnt liking it, it was good to get a laught or two, was lacking so many things like characters with brains, but after watching it all i started liking it, obv so many things dont make sense like decision making of the characters, some stupid sacrifices, some scenes lack zombies and characters talk a lot and scream. If you like entertainment this is good, now story is cute but nothing that good of a masterpiece, i would rate the story a 4/10, could be better."
5544,All of Us Are Dead,I was expecting a good zombie series. The setting is not bad.Most of the characters are useless.There's nothing interesting. Boring. Bad script.Some of the kids are not good at acting.
5545,All of Us Are Dead,"I think the director was forced to kill atleast one main character in each episode...literally one or 2 main character/s die in each of the episodes.....and the origin story was basically trash ,but the school plot was quiet interesting that makes you watch the whole season....so that is it....conclusion: the origin story could have been better."
5546,All of Us Are Dead,"Good lord. I know horses for courses but what do folk watch besides this to give it 7+? It's sooooo hard to like.The dubbing . It's the reason the script is painful. Maybe.The uniforms. It's the reason the characters are generic. Perhaps.The age of the characters. Is why they stand around and or make the same stupid descisions again and again . And again. And ... again.. and again...
and aga...... if you hate my review, the .... oh and again....
And again...
You get the point.This. Series. Is dull .even when it's exciting I couldn't care what happens to these unlikable YA.s and their dull melodrama. The adults of course are worse.Now saying that over many many days and dull evenings I did get to episode 8 (only)out of 12!!!! Wtf. And then I realized life's to F Ing short. So I even stopped hate watching.I'm sure it's fun for a lot of people but if you think you may get bored when you see a scene again...and again.... I'm here to save you your time.Switch off."
5547,All of Us Are Dead,"I had a high hope that this could be next ""Kingdom"" or ""Train to Busan"" but unfortunately it's not.However, if you haven't watched ""Kingdom"" or ""Train to Busan"" yet, This TV series could be a good start for you to become a Korean zombie flicks."
5548,All of Us Are Dead,This movie helps you in future if this situation showed in TV series if that would in occure in real life. You could learn each life saving ways vey closely. During watching this series please drink water because it will forget you.
5549,All of Us Are Dead,"This was a great 12 episode TV show for me.If you like Train to Busan and Kingdom, this is a great show for you.This show is a treat as it has tons of gore.There are some plot holes or things that didn't make sense but overall this is another Korean show that will go in my top 10 of awesome zombie shows/movies.Cannot wait for season 2."
5550,All of Us Are Dead,"One Of the Best Web Series I ever Seen.... Fully drama, action, suspense a complete full package series.... Waiting For Season 2 Soon....
We Want Season 2 All Of Us Are Dead 💯💯💯"
5551,All of Us Are Dead,"A little bit more thrill was expected. Although had a great time. It was not just about zombies. Ahh so much sacrifices, some felt unnecessary. Chemistry of those characters was very charming."
5552,All of Us Are Dead,"In the beginning it looks like it's a masterpiece, but it's not. I could give 8 stars if it had a good ending, a lot of people die, ok, it's expected from a zombie series, but you're not expecting the best character to die, it's just ridiculous. You can watch it from the episode one to number eleven, after this, this series sucks. People like happy endings, or at least an Easter egg that something good can happen, but this series just failed."
5553,All of Us Are Dead,"Please watch 1ep for 1day.if one at a time it feels boring
Some Repeat fights, but story is a some little bit unique.Camera work is best, You need Spoiler 😂😂😂,"
5554,All of Us Are Dead,"I love zombie movies not the low budget and corny acting zombies.. but TRAIN TO BUSAN WAS MY FAVORITE ZOMBIE MOVIE OF ALL TIME even though it's a foreign movie THAT SAYS A LOT... (Also watched the movie 5 years late after its first released)...
But this show ALL OF US DEAD... people disliking this show.. lack wisdom and emotion... when this show had all the above.. including hidden messages about humanity in general if you really are paying attention.. to the casting crew, script writers and director.. VERY WELL DONE!!! Koreans films are no joke! Love it! I want season 2 ASAP!!!"
5555,All of Us Are Dead,This is number 1 zombie show recommended. This series deserves recognition. The zombie kid actors are beautiful and perfect for roles. Favorites is Namra and HyuSeok. Please More more of this couple should be. More cheesy moments to mix with scary tension. The cinematic scenarios are good. There are many tense moments... Funny sometimes and mostly scary because of the running chasing and gore. Namra should show more of her powers. More actions running please...and i hope the writers add more survival survival techniques . This is nice to watch with Girlfriend or Friends or family .. Enjoy and scream same time.
5556,All of Us Are Dead,"The zombies are active, very agile and can run fast, which is very important because it will make the audience tense to watch it, even though the content of the story is not as good as the first train to busan, but this is better than the walking dead with weak zombies, hopefully another story will emerge zombies from south korea."
5557,All of Us Are Dead,Loved it from start to finish. Every episode leaves with suspense. I recommend this everyone to watch it. You never get bored from start to finish. Waiting for season 2./
5558,All of Us Are Dead,This is not just another spin off on the zombie genres. The Koreans have given it a twist and added lots of emotional elements to it. One can relate to each and every character in this series. I am shocked at the talent coming out of South Korea - how do they find such great actors? Each and every person has put so much effort and it shows throughout the 12 episodes. The scale is huge and Netflix has put lot of money in this. Please watch it straightaway if you haven't already.Me and my wife are looking forward to season 2 already :)
5559,All of Us Are Dead,"The Movies should be an example for real life, but this movie show a bad morality in each character on their movies. It's a shame, a movie like this should be able to set a good moral example for the audience.So many korean movies like this."
5560,All of Us Are Dead,"It's not a terrible show . But seriously , how can they make these characters so idiotic . The girl that killed the classmate with the cloth was one of the worst characters I've ever seen in a show. I nearly had to stop watching after her first few scenes. Then we get to the character on the roof that can hear them talking on the other side of the door then tells the Blackhawk soldiers with guns that there's no one left ? Like seriously , even in a life and death situation , no one would ever do something like that . It's absolutely ridiculous. The people at rotten tomatoes giving this show 100% must not have brains, cuz it would be impossible to give this show a 10/10."
5561,All of Us Are Dead,"I enjoyed but i found the story was streched unnecessarily,the same sort of thing kept happening and happening and this could be ended by epi 11,but again streched unnecessarily for the 2nd season."
5562,All of Us Are Dead,"Thrilling and entertaining series. Great acting by each one of the characters, infact few characters are brilliant. Nice story line, A must watch one👍🏻"
5563,All of Us Are Dead,"This is easily the best Korean drama I've ever seen. The action is sustained, well-paced and highly engaging, the stunt choreography is arguably the best I've seen across any genre, any country, and the acting and script are top notch. It avoids the repetitive and expositional motifs of a lot of Korean tv, doesn't have any significant filler and manages to keep saccharine moments to a minimum for what is mainly a high school horror drama. The episodes fly by despite being either side of an hour in length, and while I would love a 2nd series, it sits perfectly as a stand-alone. The zombies are scary and amusing at the same time, it has mastered Korean tv's knack for intrinsic comic timing, and the villains are genuinely intimidating. Also the best zombie tv show I've ever seen, tonally it's more 28 Days Later than the Walking Dead (thank god). 100/10, would recommend."
5564,All of Us Are Dead,"If you're looking for some 'Train to Busan' kind of horror or action, then walk away because the movie isn't for you.Not every zombie movie or show has to have the same storyline; it can either be funny like ""Zombieland,"" serious like ''World War Z' or be in the form of a TV series like ""The Walking Dead.""It depends on your preferences. Speaking of ""All of Us are Dead,"" it's a decent watch if you're into survival genre and you have nothing else to watch at the moment.In addition to that,
1. It's based on a popular webtoon
2. The effects are good
3. It's only 12 episodes, unlike some TV series with 16 plus."
5565,All of Us Are Dead,"A story of a father's frustration towards his son not being able to fight back against bullies lead him to create a virus that improves a persons animalistic nature and craving for violence.Although this movie trended worldwide, the step back to how old zombie movies were portrayed was really annoying. The sheer number of ""pause before you act"" moments is the total opposite of how humans act when in danger. One student even mentioning he watched Train to Busan, but still did not know how to act when being hunted by zombies.Also the way the script tries to insert love story has cause the film to be flimsy at times. Givent he fact that these are kids, i can understand that crushes and love are a big deal for them, but i find it irrelevant on this film.Another issue i find with this film is the way they include a ""final boss(Gui-Nam)"" in an already convoluted story. Yet, the final goal of the antagonist was really shallow. Fight sequences usually involves people standing and doing nothing while watching their friends being beaten up.And lastly if you expect a solution and/or a happy ending for this story, there is none. This is the most common way for directors to tell you, ""to be continued...""Overall, it's a good take on the horror of how a government, it's policies, and humans react when their lives are on the line. This movie is good, but would have been better.On a side note, please please can't zombie movies have intelligent protagonist. It's 2022 people, most individuals should have watched one or two zombie movies already."
5566,All of Us Are Dead,"Just got done watching the first season, it was really amazing, I love the drama and sadness. It was very tense. Bone cracking throughout the whole scenes, I'm hoping the Director does bring season two This was way better than squid game."
5567,All of Us Are Dead,"Great story and very relatable characters, even tho some of them are incredibly annoying but that just gives more points to realism of charachter diversity. 10/10.South Korea really made them self a king when it comes to zombie genre with entries like Train to Busan, Kingdom and now this beautiful gem."
5568,All of Us Are Dead,"Just binged the and to be honest ,I loved it. A little slow in places with the guilty party being the romance side of things as mayhem and carnage was being carried out just a doors width apart,but I guess to inject sum humanity into the series these parts were justified. Overall it's what it says on the tin,well acted ,filmed well,the mass zombie assaults were extremely well done,all the extras were obviously having a ball.Great series ,I'd highly recommend this."
5569,All of Us Are Dead,"First moment, it started well but by going end of it, it becomes miserable Korean emotional drama.I couldn't understand characters, I couldn't understand their decisions. Over actings against their families and friends made feeling so stressed.Too much dramas for zombie action. The original webtoon was kind of this, but they shouldn't apply this kind of unnecessary things.And why they chose those bad actors?"
5570,All of Us Are Dead,"It's unsurprising that another excellent show tackling the zombie genre has tumbled out of South Korea, yet again showing us that the undead category is still alive and kicking.I can sing this shows praises to the moon and back with truly excellent camerawork focusing on complex wide sweeping shots condensing down into close ups all in one take, not to mention a clearly competent directorial team on deck. The setting is, although fairly overdone in zombie media (a high school), showcased to us in a fairly fresh and interesting way, with plenty of background building before the main outbreak occurs and a very in depth look at the good and bad already occurring at the school.That being said I absolutely need to address the few issues this show has sadly, they aren't small. While the acting is decent enough to not ruin the immersion, actually on the contrary it ranges from decent to fantastic, the stupidity that runs rampant absolutely is. Characters suffer from the zombie flick stereotype of suddenly forgetting all common sense until it is absolutely crucial, survivors have to be taught the absolute basics of survival despite stating several times that they've seen zombie movies, they reference Train to Busan for gods sakes but don't know how to push a table against a door until a teacher arrives?It's also a shame that one of this shows greatest strengths also becomes its greatest weakness, as it's ability to jump between separate survivor groups is seamless and anticipated, it is also annoying at times and very much unnecessary. Without going into detail there are entire character arcs pushed in to the already overcrowded narrative who don't contribute to the story and serve no purpose to anything other than a small emotional hit to the viewer. That's all. Unnecessary and very annoying to watch. It also must be said that the animation, a thankfully minor part of the mostly prop/makeup based effects, is laughably bad. Luckily it is only used sparingly.Overall, however, I am thrilled at the end results and despite the aforementioned issues, I can't wait to bite into more. Hopefully season 2 will be just as frantic and exciting!"
5571,All of Us Are Dead,"There is a LOT of drama in this show which at times was a little bit hard to believe because there's an actual zombie apocalypse happening and these high school kids are still worrying about ""who likes who"" and throwing temper tantrums and the protagonist girl giving the cold shoulder to the protagonist guy who has a major crush on her.I also really didn't like how it seemed like the most important person to save during the entire show was On-jo. So many people sacrificed their lives for her and yet she was being so selfish throughout the entire show.But I was willing to look past all of that, as long as they were going to let my man Cheong-san get the girl in the end. But NOPE! They made Cheong-san a simp for On-jo the entire show and then the second she finally starts treating him right, they kill him off.I don't know if this is typical in K-dramas but they made a lot of the guys weak, timid, bumbling buffoons. There was A LOT of female-on-male violence which was more than annoying and the males were always scared of the females and just took their beatings like wimps.There were significantly more female students alive at the end than males, so it promotes the idea that males are expendable and should sacrifice themselves for the females, but also that the females were smarter and better survivors.I'm also mad about them killing off some of the best characters. Like for example they killed off the scientist who created the virus pretty early when he could have played a bigger role in the show. On-jo's dad spent the entire show trying to find her, he finally finds her and then gets bit within 2 seconds of finding her.The episodes are long (around 1hr each) and there is 12 of them so it starts to get a bit exhausting with all the drama but the ending was okay because they left it open for a sequel season but at the end of the day.I enjoyed the show at times and was annoyed at other times so that's why it gets a 5/10. If they let my man Cheong-san live and get the girl in the end it would've been a 7/10 but they did him dirty. Lived and died a simp. Shameful."
5572,All of Us Are Dead,"After watching it, we can be sure there won't be any season 2. Cause they finished it beautifully. But still hoping for another season. You should also watch the lead actress's (Ji-hu)'s great masterpiece ""House of Hummingbird"""
5573,All of Us Are Dead,There are many zombie movies already for us. But it is simply superb....👌wonderful acting.. not a slow start at all....must give a try for to this fabulous series... And it gonna be a best series like sucide squad....
5574,All of Us Are Dead,"This series just feels so real, and everything happened in it can be convincingly happening in real life, this is what most zombie series are lack of. And another thing this series is good at is the action scenes, they really did a great job.All characters in this drama is depicted well, with their distinct personalities, even those characters that only appeared once or twice. The main characters also got distinct personalities and each of the acted very well, that's what we need for a zombie drama, because a zombie drama without deep character development can be pure brainless entertainment with lot's of gore and violence only.There're also shortcomings in this series, especially in mid sections of this drama, everything gets a little boring, however, the plot is getting more and more attractive as the plot goes on, and it can still hook audiences without much action scenes involved.Overall, this series is a great zombie series with great action scenes, and a decent plot with deep character development, it's a zombie series with good production value."
5575,All of Us Are Dead,"It's definitely one of the better zombie flicks. The acting is great, the story is good. I would have given it a 7 or 8 if it weren't for two very annoying things, that I couldn't get past:1. They had literally nothing to eat or drink for what seemed more than two days, while half the time running, fighting zombies, climbing up and down buildings, and parkouring. Non of them seemed pretty fazed about that and apart from a few comments, the lack of vital sustenance in a zombie apocalypse, was considered pretty much like an insignificant detail, rather than the difference between life and death.2. Decision making and reactions were at points absurdity itself. Someone is bitten, turning, and will kill us all - let's stare and see what will happen - that, on more than one occasion. Zombies are attacking my friends - let me stare for a while and then hit them with a book. We have to make other split second decisions - again let's stare. There's a lot of staring going on.Overall, however it's a good movie if you get past this and some other annoying details."
5576,All of Us Are Dead,Watch it now would do anything to be able to watch it for the first time again i feel empty whenever i'm not watching this but i feel like the shouldn't of killed off cheong su. And should've included more scenes of su hyeok (bare-su) and isak should've died a bit later on so it was more emotional. Diffenatley recomend want to be nam tamra tbh.
5577,All of Us Are Dead,This web Series Batter then other Zombie web series.And i really like this all characters.spacial Nam-ra an gwi-nam. And This series want a 9/10 Rating.An I want know about last scene..?An I'm very excited for second Season.
5578,All of Us Are Dead,"Not your usual train to Busan spread over 540minutes Zombie fiesta. You'll be disappointed.The starting looks promising, like most Korean shows. It escalated once the kidnapped student got her first bite. From then on, hell broke loose and quick. But I don't buy the story of this outbreak not reaching outside the city given the modern instant tech we have now. You'll telling me thousands of student though surrendered their phones for class and not one of them has a stealth phone somewhere??How the capital, Seoul and their white house and no international coverage was mentioned for outbreak of this scale is beyond me.Plot holes are too constant as show progress. The main cast of students all live like cat's life, outwitting speedy zombies throughout the show without a scratch hardly, with sometimes 1V1 fend off. Bear in mind these students hadn't had a meal or sip of water for days yet their adrenalin never seems to wear off.The Shakespearian little romances between some of them are putting me off so much that I fast forward to the action most of the time. Who has the time to confess to their crush when you not eat drink or poop in days, stinky all over with cracking lips?!Director could have spare us the melodrama and trim this down to 8 eps of pure adrenaline pumping thriller.Visual is good don't get me wrong. The acting skills of all the walking and running zombies deserves a shout out, more than the humans, yea and the director's.Now many aspects of the show barely fit much of the logic, which plays a huge part to a serious film watcher like me.Why would Einstein the scientist ask the detective to retrieve his laptop for the remedy? When eventually, he mentioned there was none and only way is to wipe out, disintegrate the bodies. HELLO? Michael Owen moment there...Who decides how long the bitten will turn into zombies?? We saw 3 seconds, 3 minutes, 3 weeks (Genius girl) . Are they generically decided? Or environmentally?? Or to the director's mood??And who decides who turns into a super zombie?? (Die hard cyclone, genius girl, bullied girl etc) they virtually have nothing in common! Intelligence or physicality wise. Pretty far fetched by now the story.And what do the zombies hunting based on? The sound as they put it? Visuals? Smells? If it's sound they would have pound on anyone moving even fellow zombians ain't it? If it's visual they would pound on the super zombies as they still walk and look like humans. If it's smell (they bypass super humans) they wouldn't have to depend on sounds then! Directors discretion again I guess.Die hard cyclone was so annoying at first as he die hard.... But I kinda rooted for him in later stages as those students were a pain to watch by now with their forgettable escaping ideas. I just wise cyclone killed them all.And if genius girl aka Seline underworld had the power all along after turning into super zombie why can't she put herself in the front for most escapades?? She's strong as hell as seem in final stages (neck breakers so on) what a waste!It's a shame I would have like to have see bullied girl super zombie take on cyclone for a kill bill showdown! They didn't mentioned her whereabouts when the series ended. What a bummer. Not some Seline underworld flew away to the covenant OMG.Since the story was half wrecked by now, I may as well see a super zombie lover boy1 take on Cyclone! But that was not to be as well...What a letdownHere's the likeable;
Liam Neelson adventure to save her daughter was heart warming to see until the absurd tennis court get to the chopper moment. Okay before that, why he opened the hall door to see her daughter?? It could be dozens of zombies with all those hard banging! Directors answer this please.The detective or his sidekick actually. A humorous acting better than most of other characters. Brings a laugh whenever his seemingly cowardice character came back to help out!The little girl, saved by Ripley. What a performance and a tear jerker in the restaurant of her enduring the lost of the mother, now a walking dead.The Archery sis, aka Katniss Everdeen the only coolest human character I like in the show. Wish the show revolves around her slaying the dead instead of the many Shakespearian plays we had to put up with.All in all, if your in for entertaining purposes then this will probably work for you.For serious film watchers like me all the little nonsensical is a deciding factor on the overview.Season 2? Bring back die hard cyclone instead of loverboy1 please. And bullied girl super zombie has yet to unleash her potential. Make use of that."
5579,All of Us Are Dead,This is the best Series i have ever watched . I Loved the series very much so i given this series 10 stars. When a first time zombie watcher Sees this series Then He will gain more respect for the Zombie community. Hope the season 2 comes Soon.
5580,All of Us Are Dead,This is my fist review!If you are like me and misses the good old chaos of the walking dead this hits the spot! Currently on episode 4 and this buildup is exeptional. Bit slow the first two episodes but worth the wait. The actors make it fun to watch in the original language imo.
5581,All of Us Are Dead,"The plot is so fake like one moment they are just students and the second later they become super ninja letal killer
Also the characters are all so stereotyped is annoying!"
5582,All of Us Are Dead,"I found this series quite interesting to watch with amazing graphics. The blood and zombie scenes are worth mentioning. Although the series gets boring at some times, and then exciting again, but over all I would say that it was worthy of my time, and you'll surely like it, if you're a zombie/blood/violence/thriller lover.Ps.I have also seen another drama, called Happiness (starring Park hyung Sik) personally, i liked it more, it has almost the same base of story, but the thing is, this series contains a hell lot of more emotions, which the above series is lacking. So yeah, DO WATCH IT TOO, i loved it!"
5583,All of Us Are Dead,"A teacher who would rather save a psychotic murderous student than 7-8 normal kids who clearly need adult supervision and guidance.A mother who runs into a zombie apocalypse, and starts calling out zombies and then gets killed basically achieving nothingA so called bright student who clearly notices a fellow student infect a kind poor kid, but does nothing to stop it, waits for the kid to get infected and die, and then calls out the psycho as if she did anyone any favor.Characters who are so shocked all the time, they won't even move when a zombie horde is coming at themBasically if you can think of all the idiotic decisions someone can take during a zombie apocalypse, they are all taken here.The writers use cheap emotional tricks to get you invested. If your characters exist only to take stupid decisions so that you can create manufacturered drama instead of organic ones, you failed as a writer.May be some like that, but i personally hate this show."
5584,All of Us Are Dead,"Yes -- I see you.This series was awesome.One of the better zombie movies for sure. It's not one of those blunt zombie movies where people get eaten alive. The movie touches upon real societal issues, youth violence & crime, and class division. There are only handful of zombie outbreak movies out there that can even compare.Ugh so much blind hate."
5585,All of Us Are Dead,I must say k zombies are the best . While a lot is going on but story and character development is still perfect . Also perfect camera work along with awesome direction.Great use of new faces (actors) and their acting is commendable.Overall a awesome awesome thriller to watch.
5586,All of Us Are Dead,"As korean i was disappointed.The original webtoon is more great than it.All story is boring.And it is cliché lump
There are too many useless scene.I don't know why this drama is NETFLIX 1st.It is just for killing time."
5587,All of Us Are Dead,"Ive readed this manhwa and it was quite enjoyable. But ive noticed theres so much other things on this serie. Some of them are quite enjoyable, but at the other some arent. Pretty disappointed."
5588,All of Us Are Dead,"They set up the story with played out tropes without any original take on them (bullies and high-teen drama), and social commentary aspect takes over the believability of the story."
5589,All of Us Are Dead,"What was that?? I'm completely amazed, bruh.Ignore the bad reviews already. Just watch it for ur own fun.It's Gory, and I loved it. Watched the first 5 episode. And it's a good."
5590,All of Us Are Dead,"If you are bored and nothing to watch I'll recommend this. But whenever that high school girl acting like damsel in distress i fast forward. Like come on, if you're faced on this situation adrenaline must kick in and stop being like you need someone to save you. Her character is annoying."
5591,All of Us Are Dead,"This's the slowest series I've ever seen in my whole like, even if this series was 4 episodes long it will still be a waste of time. I swear I completed the whole series in 2 hours by just skipping most of the scenes, btw I regret wasting these 2 hours."
5592,All of Us Are Dead,All of us are dead movie is not just k drama movie it is a horror and goosebumps movie. It will give you just goosebumps. I just loved this movie and I am now exited for season 2.
5593,All of Us Are Dead,"From start to end, stupidity... Stupidity..... Stupidity.Senseless.Meaningless
Predictable
Overrated
Craze about Korean looks might have created buzz."
5594,All of Us Are Dead,"Okay, so I started watching this series because me and my girlfriend kinda like zombie series.Korean is a weird language for us and the names are very hard to remember since (for me) they look all the same. I'm from The Netherlands. Me and my girlfriend didn't know who was who. It's difficult to explain but that made it very hard for us to follow the characters and their storyline. Also, the first scene was very strange and hard to watch. I hate bullying but this was from another level. Then I read Online that these kind of behaviour is kinda normal in Korea. That shocked us. Then girls were beaten by guys and raped. That just absolutely isn't fun to watch.I watched three episodes. It was very slow-paced, cruel and felt weird. Train to busan (a very good Korean Zombie movie) was a lot better because it was character driven and there were just a few characters who had easy names to remember.This flick felt like a very cruel and bad script. We both wouldn't recommend watching this. It's literally horrible.We just finished Lost (the series) which was TERRIFIC. One of the best shows we have ever seen. Then we tried this and Archive 81, and those were just plain boring and bad.We both don't recommend this series. Save your time and search for a better one ("
5595,All of Us Are Dead,"I honestly had no idea of what I was getting into. I only recently got into KDrama so this is a whole new thing. But I'm not going to give this a 10 star as for my anger towards the huge unexpected plot twists! Yet in a way its intriguing and entertaining. I did cry about this show because of the way the main characters died, but I also was angry of how it's displayed the term zombies. Sure its not a scientific explanation of zombies but I feel it could've been different by the normal stereotype. I did feel a little sick of how real it looks though!"
5596,All of Us Are Dead,"Good series, great acting, annoying characters and absurd ending. The director and the cast and crew did a great job.I just didn't like the way it ended."
5597,All of Us Are Dead,"Best zombie story ever.....the characters have played their role exceptionally and vfx+sound were on the next level
Can't resist watching it again and again........eagerly waiting for SEASON -2............with the news that Cheong-San is ALIVE<3<3Highly recommended for zombie lovers:)<3."
5598,All of Us Are Dead,Talking but not saying anything real. Zombie lore acknowledged but no looking for resources. Fights that make no sense. Actions in general making no sense. This is just bad.
5599,All of Us Are Dead,"I did not expect to see a series that talks about zombies with this talk. It beat all my expectations. I really enjoyed this wonderful Korean, and the Koreans proved that they are the kings of zombies in their embodiment and their craftsmanship when they turn into zombies. It is a wonderful acting team and creativity from everyone as well as creativity from the author, director, script and dialogue that they are wonderful And they crush the Oscars. They presented this masterpiece with conscience, creativity, effort and obvious fatigue. I really enjoyed it and waiting for the second part.Thank you imdb team."
5600,All of Us Are Dead,"It is the best zombie apocalypse series I have ever seen.Every character justice their role. As a student, I can relate to the characters easily. I love bonding between them. Love, compassion, friendship, fun everything.Sound effects, VFX all are top-notch. Korean made the best movies, series no doubt.The last of this series has a great twist.Hope it's session 2 coming very soon early waiting."
5601,All of Us Are Dead,"Over 12 hours for a zombie story!!!!! God it gets boring and repetitive after initial 2-3 episodes. After that it is just counting how different people becomes zombie and keep counting bodies. Too many subplots and hell lot of characters, unnecessary drag."
5602,All of Us Are Dead,"Very entertaining and engaging through the end.Cinematography and action scenes are fantastic.A new zombie variation gives some twist to the series.Total number of episodes could have been reduced, little lengthy."
5603,All of Us Are Dead,"Just finished watching the first episode (the series got released today). Started out with interesting character development and story building. One thing I like, and perhaps what may make this series different from other zombie series/movies, is that it tries to establish the similarities between domination of certain sections of people over the others in our society and dominant / invasive nature of parasites/viruses over other living organisms, irrespective of intelligence, consciousness or any other things.Will have to see how the rest of the series turns out to be. Hope it turns out to be another critically acclaimed Korean series, among so many others."
5604,All of Us Are Dead,"Great filming, great make up, great actors .A litle hard to believe ""5 guys cant brake a door , from wood and with tiny lock "" directors maybe think twice next time :(
In rest 10/10 good job !!!"
5605,All of Us Are Dead,"If you want to see how it feels like to take 1 gallon of paint and try to paint a 3 story house with it, listen to this TV Show.There are sometimes good stuff, but there are some scenes that could have been definitly removed."
5606,All of Us Are Dead,"Decent zombie action but too much drama. What is 12 1 hour episodes could have been 6 45 minute episodes. Too much filler so after a couple episodes everything is too repetitive. The bullying trope is really corny and overdone. The main villain's motives are unrealistic. None of the characters are likeable. I think this show is overhyped because of the ""squid game"" momentum that Korean shows have. Overall it is a mid series."
5607,All of Us Are Dead,I've been watching zombie movies for 30 years. I have watched or attempted to watch every movie or show containing zombies.This one is definitely the worst. It's pointless and ridiculous nonsense. I could only watch the first episode and less than ten minutes of the second one.This show is bad beyond compare.
5608,All of Us Are Dead,"This is way far better than all The Walking Dead seasons combined. Highly recommended for both who likes the zombie genre and those who doesn't like it.This isn't your usual, ordinary, zombie show. It's full of character development, real life and realistic drama, and lessons in survival and life itself."
5609,All of Us Are Dead,"Half-baked story, good effects, bad realization.One logical fault follows by the next. I got annoyed too many times while watching the series. The series is very predictable. I was very disappointed."
5610,All of Us Are Dead,"Oh Korea what have you done?! You have ruined the good name for quality shows you once had by making this atrocious zombie tv show. Episode 1 was long enough to tell your story and end it and it may have been ok, but 12 episodes, wow. 12 episodes of the worst thing I have seen in many years. Congratulations."
5611,All of Us Are Dead,"As an avid zombie fan I put this in my top 5 best zombie shows / movies of all time. The acting from the zombies is phenomenal. It's realistic feeling, blood everywhere, bodies slamming every which way exactly like it would be if this were real life. I have wondered in several scenes whether anyone actually got hurt, I mean they go HARD. Could the dubbing be better - of course, I'm yet to see a dubbed show or movie that couldn't have been better however this is the best I've seen yet. I can only hope they make more like this."
5612,All of Us Are Dead,"If you want to slap your forehead every five minutes, this series helps you maintain the rhythm. I'm used to characters in horror movies and series making idiotic decisions, I really am, but this takes it to a whole new level. If this series tried to mock the stupidity of most horror flicks, it would be a fun little series, but unfortunately it tries to be serious. What a waste of time and brain cells. I don't understand the high ratings, but to each their own I guess."
5613,All of Us Are Dead,"Like every zombie show, it starts good, with an interesting premise and good development. But like every zombie show, after the first/second act the characters become dumb, there´s a lot of plot holes, etc, etc, etc.The photography is pretty good and the acting is also not bad."
5614,All of Us Are Dead,I watched all episodes. Overall it was a good watch. Sometimes it becomes boring too see some long conversations. They seem to be usesless. Yes i understand there is a philosophy about this show but they don't need to smash it all the time.
5615,All of Us Are Dead,"Being an zombie movie how you can think to make it realistic. I think writer thought what if we face zombies as same as we faced covid..That lee na character you killed her in a funny way.. And then the father who fought so hard to reach and protect her daughter and you just give them hardly two minutes. She still remained the same with,You made the villain hero by killing cheosang.All of us are dead! How? You should kill all then, why some left
Complete disappointment.."
5616,All of Us Are Dead,"I liked the slow pacing here. Yeah some might get annoyed with this but overall the series was decent. Some scenes are pretty brutal, they didn't hold back. There are some moves and consequences which annoyed me very. Some deaths and also few others things. Yeah it is fiction, but some parts were completely missing. But a potential season 2 has the chance to be much better."
5617,All of Us Are Dead,"Poor series, no clear story, its full if zombie killing action scenes are cool but no story at all, and 12 episodes is too long for this series. And in short time too many series/movies centered on Zombies where is the creativity ?"
5618,All of Us Are Dead,"The show is mid and all imma say is, it's the characters fault. It could have been good but 80% of the characters are written so dumb. Almost all of them are the female characters.At one point they're trying to make a fire to warm themselves and they keep struggling for like 10 minutes and all of a sudden this one girl goes I have a lighter and I'm like b**** why u didn't say that earlier. And there is that other girl who used to get bullied a lot, she got infected but isn't a zombie, all she got are superpowers and she uses them to kill someone who comforted her a lot of times in the past infront of the military and other people. And then she gets shocked when the military dudes take her away and lock her up like bruh what u expect when u bite someone to death??? Stupid b****."
5619,All of Us Are Dead,"The main characters were not smart. They knew it was zombies, yet did not bother to smash the brains. Also, so many stupid decisions made by the characters - only to make everything more dramatic."
5620,All of Us Are Dead,"Loved the character arcs, the unexpected twists (literally nothing goes the way you'd expect it to for any character) a thoroughly enjoyable experience with a particularly poignant final episode. Cannot wait for season two."
5621,All of Us Are Dead,"I am a fan of zombie movies and series... you name it and probably I have seen it... Korean zombie concept is always high impact fast moving ones and this one was no exception to ""Kingdom"" or ""Train to Busan.Having said that, this series doesn't deliver anything more than an average story. Originality of virus unclear, acting mediocre, ending typical. Tries to introduce some novel concept like ""intelligent zombie"" but could have been better.But still I gave 7/10 just because the plot was better executed than many other zombie series... a good one time watch probably. Notjing more."
5622,All of Us Are Dead,"Think Freakish and Walking Dead: World Beyond with the frequent intensity of Train to Busan, but so much better than the first two. Even with some of the cliched relationships and instances, this still felt much more creatively original than the garbage that's come out of the US for the past decade."
5623,All of Us Are Dead,"Low budget and the story really sucks it is very slow. The characters are all very annoying, it's just dumb. I think the writers like bullies. If you want to waste time getting annoyed you might want to watch this. This show is not for me."
5624,All of Us Are Dead,"From like 20 characters only 3-4 characters who have good acting, the rest is meh, many plot holes,and the story is average,the characters doing dum thing and that make no sense because it workwith that budget they should make a far better series than this,kingdom is far better than this if you want watch korean zombie.Character development is meh,
the only good character is the bully villain with white jacket, the annoying girl with pink jacket and the mc.The Dectetive,the one who good in fight,the Big boy,mc best friend,and class leader is decent,the rest team is trash, fmc trash, archer girl and her friends trashthe only good thing about this series is cinematography."
5625,All of Us Are Dead,"The one thing that makes me rate this show higher than most zombie shows, is the lack of stupidity needed to advance the plot.Sure, teenagers in a high stress situation make mistakes, but realistic and understandable ones.The higher ups have some hard decisions to make and are realistically conflicted about it.Even the highschool drama makes sense to me."
5626,All of Us Are Dead,This show does a good job at drawing you in but then it moves incredibly slow. Lots of repeated scenarios and things happening that are never really followed up on. There's a lot of potential for a good story with chances for deeper character development but it doesn't seem like we ever get the satisfaction of these teenagers really learning anything? High production value. Prob won't watch season 2 though.
5627,All of Us Are Dead,"Netflix's bots are rating this up, otherwise I don't understand how this could be a +7 / almost 8 serie. Do you a favor and don't loose time with this one."
5628,All of Us Are Dead,"Honestly, everything is almost perfect but the reason I can't give two more star is when the character fall over and trip again a few times. Second is when certain character decided to sacrifice themselves in hope to help the other but it's just getting me pain. As example, when Cheong-san mother secretly arrived at the school, she called his son friend that already got bitten and I was shouting stoopid so loudly in front of my camera. Furthermore this drama drive me up the wall when Na-yeon murdered Cheong-san friend with a wipe of handkerchief that contain zombies blood and then all the hateful moments appears a lot and more to come. She is the cause of why the group created negative vibes and I hate it but I know every survival movies will always have that person. Anyway it's worth to watch it and I've just finished this drama in four days. VERY RECOMMENDED! *of course we are waiting for SEASON 2, IT MUST HAVE, because the ending keep me hanging and questioning......."
5629,All of Us Are Dead,"Nobody does Zombie like the Koreans. The moves, the story, the acting all top notch.Train to Busan is one of my favourite zombie films of all time and this series is going to be one of my favourites too10/10."
5630,All of Us Are Dead,"There's no congruency in the time required for the humans turn to zombies, some take seconds some take whole hours, there's no realism in the state of the corpses after being clinically dead for days, no explanation as to why some people only partly turn to zombies and how the whole thing works except a few remarks about how the virus might have mutated (?).The actors are absolutely terrible, there's almost no action whatsoever. It's just full of teenage drama, and by teenagers I mean those weird kids in every class that nobody talks to and their problems.And for the love of Christ, what's with the ""bad guy"" running around his classmates trying to kill them the entire series? Why? What's his motivation? ""Aaaaargh I must take your eye aaaargh!! You didn't let me kill you now you must payyy aaargghhh!!"". What in the world?Luckily people have a soft spot for Korean series and always overrate them for some reason, because if this was in English it would have had a 4-5 rating tops."
5631,All of Us Are Dead,"In general, I would say this is a very good show. I admit there are some flaws in some plots. You can still call this zombie show a good one. It covers a lot of topics. High school campus life, school bullying, society problems, politics, friendship, love, humanity. All of this elements in one show, compared with some other zombie show, this one is extraordinary."
5632,All of Us Are Dead,Actors who portrayed Cheong San and Nam Ri as well as the adults were able to deliver but some were totally lacking especially the one who played On Jo.Storyline is meh. Tried to tackle a bit too much that audience would not feel much empathy towards the characters.Good zombies make up though.
5633,All of Us Are Dead,"Why this is just a 7.6 ?!And why all the hate on this show , in my opinion it was hell of brilliant show , a lot of thrillers , a lot of high drama , a lot of good moments.I hope they renew it for a second season."
5634,All of Us Are Dead,"Finnaly the zombie korean series involving high schooler is here. The plot of every episode is solid, not too slow and not too fast. The thriller chased by zombie is pump up my hearbeat."
5635,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm a huge fan of the zombies genre and this is was just horrible. It had so much potential, it could've been another Battle Royale theme but with zombies. I guess we got spoiled with Kingdom and Train to Busan. As mentioned in the other reviews, the dialogue drags and it doesn't go anywhere. The kids were so annoying I was literally hoping they would all die so the series would end. The worse is when they all just stand there while watching their friends get killed or watching one of them fight off a slew of zombies. Poorly developed storylines and characters. I can't believe there are 12 episodes to this disappointing mess. I stopped in the middle of 5 and I should've cut my losses after 2."
5636,All of Us Are Dead,"Absolutely amazing. One of the best Korean drama. It hits much harder when you come to the realization that a pandemic is already going on and we are helpless. This drama gives hope and tells what friendship means and how far one can go to take revenge. It's a complete mix of thrill, horror, drama and cute romance."
5637,All of Us Are Dead,"Don't waste your time with this. It's boring and stupid. You'll be frustrated by the characters actions and dialog.For example:
Spoilers: if you're alone in a science lab and you hear a rattling sound, the sensible thing would be to RUN or WALK AWAY. And not snoop in. Most definitely NOT insert your finger in a caged hamster! Seriously! How dumb was that???"
5638,All of Us Are Dead,"Having enjoyed Squid Game, thought I would give this a go, the first scene was very violent but captivating all the same, as the storyline became clearer it became addictive viewing. Only watched 3 episodes but really enjoying this South Korean horror fest. Enjoy."
5639,All of Us Are Dead,"Im in a rush so ill be shortThe cinematic language of this series is all over the place. They enphazise moments with camera and script that end up being for nothing leaving a feeling of unfinishness... Also, most of the deaths are meaningless which would be nice if that was a premise, but its not. So most characters die without having their arch finished or even developed, like the girl who tried to bring food to the rooftop. The pacing of these deaths were also weird. Most of them had very little development or build up, which is normal for a secondary character, but why dies the mom go to the school just to die and then carry on with the series like nothing happened just to have Cheong-san find her in the lasts episode... like dont show me her death if there's no purpose (narratively speaking). Cuz the feelings, intentions and purpose of her deaths gets thrown away for the rest of the series just to have such a superficial aspect at the end. That can be said for most of the characters.And then when a truly important character dies theres nothing to say of them, they just die and end of story, even our protagonist dies without doing anything with the antagonists and we dont even see he's actual deaths... just boom: end.There's also many times where I felt they left something open for developement like weird zombies or the lantern, which only purpose (of the lantern) was for the daughter of the firefighter to find it later and have 3 seconds of her crying and then tell her father's partner he's dead in a very anticlimactic way...On the other hand it's pretty enterteining, won't elaborate the cons anymore actually since i see the review section full of people who point out the strong points of this drama.Either way i enjoyed it, the tensions was a bit too much for me in the first episodes so the tone got messed up when they suddenly introduce some comic relief after the first half... Like i needed that a long time ago instead of constant running, tension and hiding. Plus they could have gone other places too, the narrative doesn't even grasp that so its a pretty conscious decison, but the screen writer could have thought of exploring more other characters, backgrounds and places... perhaps the protagonists could have escaped a lot sooner cuz, for me, it got to a point where i was like ok... they're trapped again... brilliant... more of the sameI insist, I enjoyed it, it was enterteining even if i just focused on the negative.PD: Sory for my horrible writting and meesy structure, im in a rush. :)"
5640,All of Us Are Dead,"**spoilers**
they literally killed 80% of the good characters and some of them even died a wasteful death they could've lived anyway they didn't show an aftermath either they just bombed the place we don't know if the main character died or the other characters died either such a waste of time in my opinion it's trying to be edgy so bad it's complete garbage compared to kingdom and train to busan."
5641,All of Us Are Dead,"If you enjoy watching Zombie stories ,definetly worth to see this show,i really enjoyed,great acting also funny moments,i do recommend it ,korean people ,you know how to do zombie stories and the best make up !"
5642,All of Us Are Dead,"I rate this show a 10/10 because it deserve a better ranking , and its the only zombie show that i like the most.I felt really connected to the characters .I had high hopes for this show and eventually im not disapointed."
5643,All of Us Are Dead,"At first i assumed that this was overhyped and going to be cheesy but i was pleasantly surprised. There are enough original takes in this series to make it worthwhile. I Just felt the end was a bit rushed and then stretched (you will know what i mean). After an episode or two i was addicted to it and had to keep myself from bingewatching it till the end. Half of the characters actually think rationally during this whole ordeal even the army people. I very much enjoyed that. I also liked that it wasnt American and thus no over the top macho BS. I think the story is finished but i do see some Angles which may justify a second season. Overall definitely worth watching even if you are not a fan of asian-export products like k-pop, manga and stuff like that."
5644,All of Us Are Dead,"Just finished the last episode of All of Us Are Dead, and was so utterly underwhelmed that it felt like taking to IMBd to write my first and only review was the closest I'd come to feeling vindaction after being duped by the +7 average rating.For the people checking out the IMDb ratings, weighing whether or not to get into this show like I was, there are no spoilers, because this review is for you.Having watched Squid Game and Parasite, I was quick to buy in to the high praise, figuring I could get past a quirk or two that comes with the dubbed over English translation, in lieu of a good storyline. There were definitely quirks, but more glaring were the absurdly ridiculous plot holes, (ie. Seemingly insurmountable situations inexplicably overcome courtesy of a convenient cut scene), unrealistic/completely irrational behavior of the characters in the show (where the thought that ""no one in their right mind would do that"" takes away from the everything else), and protagonists that flat out suck to watch.Giving credit where credit is due - I did watch all 12 episodes after all; albeit, teetering on turning it off the entire time. It brings just enough to the table to keep you invested in terms of production value and SFX. I will also say, it does bring a fresh take to the zombie genre as other reviewers have mentioned.But all of the good is heavily outweighed by the crimgeworthy dialogue, the comically poor decisions of the main characters, and the lazy writing leading to jarring gaps in storyline.If you read this and decide to watch anyway, which you probably will, do yourself a favor by drastically lowering your expectations. And if after the first 11 episodes, you aren't yet completely pissed off that you're still watching, then the last episode will surely do the trick, (ep 12 is an infuriating turd of a conclusion that will finally confirm your suspicions that, yes, you too were also catfished by that 7.7 IMDb rating"")."
5645,All of Us Are Dead,"Okay, first thing first, I'm not a fan of zombie movie or series AT ALL. But this show was still good and I was binge-watching and finished watching for 1.5days.The plot was probably nothing special, but still well-made and enough to make me addicted. The story is combined with fear, teenagers love story, family love and some hint of resemblance of Covid-19 world."
5646,All of Us Are Dead,The plot and direction are great!also there is some goofs on series!I don't think that it's necessary to kill most of the team in their way to home!i looking for the better ending but i discouraged in episode 11.Can't wait to watch the next season with better endings.
5647,All of Us Are Dead,"The main character is insufferable. All the characters are shallow and full of cliché.The plot is the same as most zombie movies. The only difference is that it's dragging and unnecessary long.If you want something easy to forget, shalloww entertaining, this one is for you. But if you're looking for a good movie, you're better off choosing something else."
5648,All of Us Are Dead,I'm annoyed I wasted so much on this one. It started okay but gotten worse by the minute. Did the writers hit a wall?It is also sexist in the way most of the girls seem to be useless except for the arrows lady.
5649,All of Us Are Dead,"Poor script, bad acting, repetitive, bad editing, average CGI. This is good for teens who never watched great zombie movies before like Train To Busan, Walking Dead, World War Z, 28 Days Later, 28 weeks later."
5650,All of Us Are Dead,It's just Fantastic from the starting till the end it keeps the audiance entertained not even a second u ll feel bore ....I'm waiting for season 2 .....when season one is excellent i don't know how they will keep up the same excitement for season 2 bcz it's not possible to make thgs even better than season 1 ....
5651,All of Us Are Dead,"The series starts off normally with events happening before the outbreak we get to experince the outbreak as a whole. And mainly focus on the struggle/heartship of the Korean students and their bullys this plays a huge factor all through the series. It's like they were approched by Netflix with the agenda to specially focus on the bullys! We gotta squeeze that valve so people will go to ride this emotional train. We also get scenes out of the daily lifes of the students parents, which does play a huge role. You're family dies in this oh no, we get hints to our current pandemic because of course which made me smile for a little to only realize that well were still in this.I did like the show in the first episodes and can say they did probably nail it pretty well with the Korean high schools. It's tough, it's uptight as heck like everyone has a broom up their bums and everyone is fanatic about being the best. Well if you have to study 12 hrs a day and you're life seems dependent on graduation off this school seems resonable.But once they get into the explnation part, where they wanna evolve the students from prey to hunters and survialist roles it kinda falls apart. Like the whole writing and logical consistency for me. It gets rather very slow and annoying to watch.Well to start off we follow arround our main lead character which spoiler dies which is not surprising. But the show made me feel uncomfortable with this taught they're students but they can do and are able to do anything reliably and with confidence. Yet they don't know that they have to bash in the head to kill of a zombie? Or to properly hide at certain times. Really, like honestly. They even have nerds in the group and the series also includes in their writing that they do know about zombie fiction. We have students that know martial arts like they have been training for that ever since. But they don't know that you know destroying their head is a effective way to kill them. No they bash their bodies through the entire series.It's a elite high school we're visiting but then how can it be that so many students die in stupid ways? Especially in the beginning on such a rapid rate. Seems illogical and unbelivable. They could have spent more budget on people then on zombie hordes. Of course all of the teachers, director, adults arround don't buy into any zombie, bullying theories or even take the chances of those being the case. Right.Because why would they? You know this character is probably someone I just can't take for granted at all here, either that they would just have someone walk up like that in a elitism school dressed and teaching their ways like he did. The writing just falls apart with this character and his background story doesn't quite add up to me. He worked at certain labs before, we don't know why this prof has the ability to create the virus we just know he's dang smart af. But then he's also unconspicious af to anyone even though his son gets bullied to the radical outline of sucide but instead of opting for homocide on the bullies he opt to make his strong stronger? What kind of dad does that, and of course as he falls into insanity none of his collegues notice this behaviour they act like that's normal or the fact that his wife, kid are missing for what seems like weeks to the very end of the show. Kinda odd that no Dective investigated that before or that they checked his place. He can happily experimentLots of the deaths are immediate and you can tell who's gonna die next it's not like you don't see it coming because usually it's portraied or hinted at visually or by having the characters, show new traits or tell most of their relevant background story in their character only to be killed off for having those.While of course zombies are fictional, having the paranormal stuff in here is ok to keep tensions up but get's rather boring quickly if the main threat zombies starts shifting into oblivion up to episode 4 they propose the main threat to the group. Only to then be exchanged for the halflings which just can't die.They of course abuse this fact and we're already starting to see how this will end. The halflings will be uptaken into society again as soon as the first outbreak stops only to be spreading in secrecy again next season by said halflings or be abused to create havoc or whatever you don't have to a be genius to not see this plot unfolding.In the end I found the choice of locations rather boring I was intruged by certain characters but having this a series format did not help it. The whole story could have been told in a lengthy movie and still be fine. They focus a lot on unnessary details and certainly for being so smart the students sometimes still do act dumb as hay if they'd never read or seen any zombie fiction.For e.g. They don't even make any attempts at luring until the end of the season which is dissappointing. Why so late and why is this technique nothing that they haven't noticed before. It's not like you would not tell that they are easily attracted to noise. They don't abuse the fact that they can't see very well and nobody mentions that well to kill them it be best to kill their brains. No we're gonna stab, hit them so many times till they die which is glorified a lot. I mean they're not killers they are students after all but then again it becomes pretty clear pretty fast they got no plan on how to kill of the zombies and are unaware, and don't care at all that they have no clue about itBit disappointed that this whole series took a dive into paranormal section while intriguing at first it becomes the predominant thread and outcome for this whole show. And the only reason why you would need a second season in the first place.Next season we might get to see fast hungered killers, and other zombie types but for this season we got to see paranormal stuff like inviciblity which is just annoying to me. But that's a big iffy.The show is good but lacks the evolvement, I did feel rather cool with the thought of them laying back at bits which was good but then it took ages for certain outcomes, and went way into depth into topic that needed no further explanation.It's a 7/10 for me being well made and all but it's defintly not a must watch. And does not take the whole zombie concept up a notch. To much smarto Tween action."
5652,All of Us Are Dead,12 episodes can be shortened to 7-8 episodes without the same scenes of zombies chasing humans. It makes the series boring. I had to skip those unnecessary parts many times. I rate 4 stars out of 10.
5653,All of Us Are Dead,"I am wating for season 2.There are few on-screen situations more dread-inducing than watching a zombie outbreak in real time. Tracking a single infection as it grows exponentially and tears through an unwitting populace is an anxiety-riddled experience that's rarely easy to watch. ""All of Us are Dead,"" the latest Netflix drama to take a stab at a widespread cataclysmic event, announces itself in its opening episode by meticulously showing the transformation of a school. In a single afternoon, the massive Hyosan High School complex is plunged into chaos after one errant bite from a science lab test animal starts an irreversible chain reaction."
5654,All of Us Are Dead,"For a group of high school students who actually figured out its a zombie apocalypse like train to busan from the first episode, their IQ and repeated behavior in the next episodes can make anyone with common sense cringe .Still if u like some gore, action and little humor here and there yeah give it a shot."
5655,All of Us Are Dead,"Great! Series! I love it! I finish this season in 2days because i excited what happen next episode
all I can say is make season 2 even better so that the ratings and good reviews of the viewers will increase even more."
5656,All of Us Are Dead,"We have seen it many times before; zombies.Now the zombies in this show is one of the only things that are good. Kudos to the actors being zombies. The make up and sound effects too. Now let's not get into the ridiculous backstory of how the zombies started...And the characters in this show is sometimes to god damn annoying and/stupid I wanna punch the screen. They makes the worst choice most of the time.The dialogs between characters and what happens between them seems so unrealistic it ruins the atmosphere.The females just stand in the background and scream while all the males has to handle things.There are few moments where it gets exciting, but the characters simply ruin this show."
5657,All of Us Are Dead,"Did not meet my expectation, I was excited for this show when I saw the trailer.But after watching thru episode 5 I gave up.The sound of bones creeking and how the body moves when they are turning into zombie is lame.Its like sadako ish.The story is boring, too much dialogue and drama.Students are not going hungry.I know some people will enjoy this but not me maybe because walking dead set the standards high.The only korean zombie series that is good is the Kingdom."
5658,All of Us Are Dead,"I liked this show. It was a good experience watching this and I was screaming when the zombies suddenly came. The most appreciated thing about this series was the makeup, the location and all the things that make zombies look real."
5659,All of Us Are Dead,"I really like zombie story and I have been watched or read a lot of them. I was really excited with this series when it was coming on netflix, so I decided to watch it as soon as possible. The first episode, I thought it would be a 'different' zombie story but too bad, it doesn't go like that. They missed a lot of details. The cafetaria scene was the worst scene in this series. Gyeong Su turned into a zombie because his scar was infected by zombie's blood, but the other characters who fighting with zombies weren't infected with zombie's blood even they have some scars on their body. It just one of them, when you're more, you will get some ridiculous moment that is not make sense on your logic. It's still fun to watch tho, but don't expect it too much 😉"
5660,All of Us Are Dead,"Terrible story, massive plot holes, incredibly infuriatingly stupid scenes and literally no attachment to any character. I don't watch zombie movies at all and I generally dislike them so I had low expectations to begin with. However, I was actually looking forward to this and was incredibly optimistic, but this has sunk below my lowered optimistic expectations because every single minute there is something to complain about. I don't even care if it had a terrible plot as long as it was fun I would've been okay with it and I really tried hard to enjoy it.This is not an opinion, this is a fact because of just how much evidence there is to support what I'm saying."
5661,All of Us Are Dead,"It's an amazing series it's my personal favourite series
Perfect cast, perfect storyline with hint of friendship, perfect location, perfect concept
It's just perfect of all😍😍"
5662,All of Us Are Dead,"I love Zombie shows but was sceptic about this one as the reviews weren't impressive. I watched first episode, and it was okay , second became better and by the 3rd I was hooked. It was non stop action from there....literally non stop. I finished it in 3 days. Well done Korea as always!"
5663,All of Us Are Dead,"The dialogue gets a lot of criticism, but as a teacher in S. K. it's on par with the speak. Their interactions, barring the two psychos, is everyday here. The only criticism I have is to the episodes. Episode 11 was the perfect send off for the show - dark, mysterious and ambiguous. They pushed forward and made a twelfth which not only had a different, child like tone; where all dread, fear and the doom had been replaced by joyful wonder. The first 11 episodes took place in a 3 day run. I know that childhood conditioning is rife here and that'd take some time to overcome or break free from, but the 12th episode is 3 months later. These children who've experienced the darkest situations should no longer approach life like children.Let's just say...if you watch till the end you can expect disappointment."
5664,All of Us Are Dead,"I had enjoyed a lot. Which ever zombie movie ever seen which is full of thiller and fantastic startagy which makes me appreciate for giving more rather
I had never seen movie like this l have watched the movie 5 times again and again with full details of existing and excitement."
5665,All of Us Are Dead,"This show is so overhyped, everything is poorly written from the characters to the plot. Compared to other amazing Asian shows such as Squid Game, Kingdom, Alice in the Borderland, etc, it's just so lackluster and stupid. A lot of things that happened in the show were so random like the pregnancy of that one student. So much potential wasted also, I was expecting the bullied Hambie to duel the Bully Hambie, and it was just so funny how Na-yeon got killed instantly, her character was so useless those few episodes she might as well have died with the teacher. It's cliche and super corny, the characters almost have no chemistry with each other, and the romance feels super forced. Main character is meh. Oh well, better not raise my expectations next time."
5666,All of Us Are Dead,"The series has a good idea, it has a nice photograph but it fails to prolong characters like the villain of the series in addition to completely silly and dumb characters."
5667,All of Us Are Dead,This web series is one of the best i had seen in my life. Entire web series is OP.You can't define this in words.Web series contains lot of thrill and adventure. You can not predict that what going next in this series.Korean web serieses are killing in this industry. After Squid game this web series is also a master piece from Korea.
5668,All of Us Are Dead,The series is absolutely good but are really more violence scene but it's really enjoyable. The acting was perfect. The screenplay is amazing.you should definitely give a try.Have a good day:)
5669,All of Us Are Dead,You should just watch this Korean Drama. A good webseries with a lot of twists and interesting story lines. Above my expectations from a Korean Drama.
5670,All of Us Are Dead,Masterpiece mind-blowing plz make season 2 best zombie series I dont have worlds to say mind blowing. Best zombie series in the world direction is awesome and acting is also great .
5671,All of Us Are Dead,"Each and every episode just hooked n booked but only the last episode of the series little bit slow n length of episode felt ,but at the conclusion I just wanna say it's completely horror + thriller combo which is made must watch drama."
5672,All of Us Are Dead,"Please do watch this series in little dim light and both headphones sounds little hight. It is very amazing. All episode are ending in such a suspence that u have to watch the next episode at that right time right there ...... Eagerly waiting for season 2
.......,.............

Please do watch."
5673,All of Us Are Dead,"All Of Us Are Dead is mind blowing web series. It's special for me as like other Korean movies and series it's really close to reality with small fictional touch and it beautifully show cases every possible human reaction and thinking people can make in such place.My Review is 10 of 10 🌟
A perfect mixture of action l, drama l, humour, love and emotion."

5675,All of Us Are Dead,Best zombie series. Korean zombie movies are the best..... Amazing series.. not feel bored in between n very interesting... I am waiting for season 2.
5676,All of Us Are Dead,Excellent camera tricks and direction and the story is awesome.Request for 2nd season.Acting of zombie is just perfect.Story and acting of non zombie character is also awesome.The bloody scene are seems original.That's all.
5677,All of Us Are Dead,It has everything zombies friendships romance bombing a total city as last resort all in one a fun watch don't miss it. Its around 11 hours long so watch it in 2 days !
5678,All of Us Are Dead,"From starting to end, not a single second seemed boring, neither the ending is predictable nor the characters you will think definitely survive will survive. It's gory, it's emotional, it's amazing. Just don't believe in bad reviews, they must have bad taste. From the first episode you'll see how amazing this series is and you'll end up binged watching it. If you like Train To Busan, you're going to love All Of Us Are Dead."
5679,All of Us Are Dead,How can a human survive 3 days without food with a good health condition?And why its 12 episodes long? I am truly disappointed after watching this series.
5680,All of Us Are Dead,"I like the start of this show very much, it got me very hooked that I finished the first 7 episodes in one go and some of those plots are convincing and heartbreaking at the same time. While not all of the protagonists' actions are sensible and enjoyable to watch, they are somewhat reasonable and if anyone got pushed to a corner, it could happen to anyone, so I'm not judging those actions at all (at least at first). Here are some the highlights as well as some problems I find that are hard to swallow and potentially can break the audience out of the show.1. I love the plot where Lee Na Yeon intentionally poisoned Nam So Ju, although the outcome is very heartbreaking, and I really hated her character at that moment. What the teacher said later is really thought provoking, the teacher apologised to Na Yeon that it's the teacher's fault to let the other students corner Na Yeon. It got me thinking, if I or any other people were in her shoe, where the world was turned upside down, and the only people around you all turned against you because you said something terrible when you were desperate and scared. While she could have apologised to So Ju and that would be a great outcome, but as a teenager and when she felt she was being cornered when she didn't even do anything wrong (in her view), it was understandable as people can do terrible things when they feel they are cornered. And as a teacher, as a grown up, the best way is sometimes not to stand to one side, because one side is right and the other is wrong, but to understand both sides and make sure both sides can talk it out and work on their differences. While at that moment, Na Yeon did seem to be the very eval character we just wish to get rid of, the world is never black and white, and people are not perfect and will make mistakes and say terrible things. And the later scene where Na Yeon was smiling at her classmates' video recording shows she does indeed have feelings toward her classmates, not ""I don't care about any of you"" when she said that, and she even made the resolve to walk past all of the infected to deliver food and drinks to her classmates at last shows she has a good side as well.2. Protagonists pretty much weren't affected by dehydration and hunger when they barely had anything to drink and eat somewhat feels unreal, but I suppose the show wants to focus on the human side rather than survival side.3. This show is about fast Zombies, and protagonists survived several waves of those attacks and even attempt to retrieve a cell phone in a wave of zombies is somewhat questionable. I do understand the urge to get help, but this action would be suicidal if they didn't have the plot armour on them.4. The superhuman zombie mutation with consciousness setting is very annoying and show breaking, it's understandable to have immunity towards it (arguably serves better plot purpose), but come on, super strength, heal automatically, never dies, they can do better than that.5. In later episodes, the show is clearly eager to get rid of more characters, as the decisions they make no longer make sense, and the death feels hollow and scripted. The father who escaped shootings with a minor scratch from soldiers with auto rifles, somehow intentionally want to sacrifice himself when he didn't need to. I mean come on, if you really wanted your daughter to survive, the best thing is to be at her side as you are strongest fighter and survival expert in the group? But instead, after successfully distracted waves of zombies, and there was clearly a room for escape, he choose to fight with those zombie and somehow got bit. Now this circles back to the superhuman mutation problem, if the person can be asymptomatic after bit, surely you don't just eagerly throw yourself and sacrifice yourself while you could wait it out to see if you are asymptomatic or not?6. Bad ending that wasted many opportunities laid by the previous plot."
5681,All of Us Are Dead,"I really enjoyed this series, some of the character arcs were really good amongst some one dimensional characters and this obviously helped. The reason for the start of the pandemic was well thought out and it gave a good start to the story. A few of the episodes probably weren't necessary and filled the series out longer than it probably should have been.If you like Zombies with a small touch of humour in places then check this out and don't take it too seriously, like most Zombie fodder it's best to not use your brain too much."
5682,All of Us Are Dead,But ...I have complained that why in every zombie series/movie main character is die at end and it is very emotional moment......................................................
5683,All of Us Are Dead,Mind blowing series.this series blow my mind to their beauty their story their characters and their connection to my heart. Must watch this series.Who watched squid game definitely you should watch this series you will love it . I'll again watch this series.And also i want to tell you i finished this series in 12 hour non stop.
5684,All of Us Are Dead,It was ridiculous that gwi nam didn't die. He never die and in finish he killed cheong-su still i can believe . Another ridiculous thing nam-ra she sometimes use Power sometimes dont use really still i cant believe.
5685,All of Us Are Dead,"I can't begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.The show doesn't fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn't very famous and that's good since you don't associate them with other roles that much.The 12 episodes just speed by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Money heist and Squid Game. Time passed away too quickly. I got too much addicted watching the first season and I BADLY WANT SEASON 2 will more twist and turns.The most exciting , fantasy,enjoyable and thrilling episodes
10/10 stars."
5686,All of Us Are Dead,"What a show! I watched it on one go. And watching my favourite scenes on daily basis. Watching youtube reaction but cant get over it. Loved Cho yi hyun and other actors performance. Overall, I just love the show waiting for season 2, hope it comes soon. Thank you team All of us are dead for giving such a wonderful show. We'll support you. Great job."
5687,All of Us Are Dead,"Enough said.I wanted to stop at ""said"" cause that sums it up but stupid imdb wont let me...oh well...here we go...Seen every horror flick there is out there...not zombies though...they move slower than my grandma .. I mean...wheres the fun there...However,I m in 6 episodes and loving this. Be patient at first..it really builds up...and worth watching due to all other social issues it raises (bullying)Maybe I m wayyy too old(46)but really this is what bullying is like nowadays? I dont wanna send my son to school after watching this...and not because of the zombies...Enough said...give it a try."
5688,All of Us Are Dead,I think the whole story was underwhelming and mediocre and some of the characters plot armour is just so crazy that sometimes it annoys you. The only redeeming quality for this series is the cinematography and some of the side characters.
5689,All of Us Are Dead,"The actors and crew excelled in all respects, the shooting and directing are wonderful, but what made me rate 8/10 is that some scenes were not necessary and serve the story, and the other aspect is that the music or the music effects are very weak in this work, it could have been presented in a better way as for the rest It is incredibly perfect. I do not like to see works of the type of the living dead, but I say that this work has taken this type of business to another level, and it is considered that the Korean works are very impressive recently."
5690,All of Us Are Dead,One of the best zombie shows I've ever watched and I've watched a lot. Amazing from start to finish. Likeable characters awesome action scenes lots of gore. Korean tv at its best.
5691,All of Us Are Dead,This is one of the best web series. In starting 1st and 2nd episode was lil boring but it makes your interest in series and after that you connect with the characters and it's one of the best experience. This series was tooooo good.
5692,All of Us Are Dead,"Very good Filmography, No unique topic though but let me tell u dat d writer is merciless,He srsly kills any body lmao ,but good story line not boring Like it....."
5693,All of Us Are Dead,"All good but ending was disappointed me. And too longer Series , maximum 8 episode for this series. Not so good not so bad .One time watchable.ygyhck ufjxdjvhb dydhvkbjc."
5694,All of Us Are Dead,"The shows bring nothing new compared to other zombies tv shows/movies. I'm 4 episodes into it and it's really slow, the characters are so cliches and the whole thing is boring."
5695,All of Us Are Dead,This was a good zombie series ever i seen before. Egurly waiting for second season. I hope this series will release in all languages. We all waiting for tamil dubbing.
5696,All of Us Are Dead,"Very much disappointed from a Korean zombie series. Nothing interesting at all. Kingdom was the best zombie series till now, nothing match that level in any manner. Waste of time, if you missed it no big deal at all. If you have lots of time just watch it and Waste your precious time."
5697,All of Us Are Dead,"A really enjoyable thriller of a zombie outbreak in korea, most of the characters are really well written, a few plot holes, but other than that this show was worth binge watching."
5698,All of Us Are Dead,"-heavy on heart
-there wasn't even a single episode which didn't make me cry
-probably the first zombie movie/series where i was actually rooting for the zombies
-heart wrenching
-I'm glad that the number 01 issue shown in the series was bullying and how it destroys literally everything.9/10."
5699,All of Us Are Dead,"Literally, best season i've watched on Netflix. The acting, production & all the side-actors are mind blown! WHAT A SERIES!! KUDOS to the team for making this masterpiece! Willing to watch Season 2."
5700,All of Us Are Dead,I like this korean series... The emotional scenes and the characters are the highlighted one.also the acting of gwi nam is truly wonderful.does chong san really died? I give hope for the return of chong san.. He is such a awesome character... I liked him. Waiting for 2nd season.
5701,All of Us Are Dead,"I don't know what to say I'm speechless but this is a very amazing show love it. I love every part of it,I love the entire episodes so cool..👍
Hope in season 2 would be very scary! I'm excited.Great show👍👍 keep it up."
5702,All of Us Are Dead,"As a full grown adult i have to say that this was major flop! My spouse was also complaining how slow, how unrealistic, how stupid behvior the teenagers had and again that how slow it was. 6 episode would have been much better. Also, the zombies movements and acting was way more better than any of the teenager actors/actresses. I have feelings that positive reviews are mainly from the teenagers who happen to be Korean movies& Zombie fans."
5703,All of Us Are Dead,"It's the first time I am going to write a review without finishing a season of a series but this deserves it! If you are a zombie fan then stop reading and start watching! It is amazing it has everything you want - lots of action, gore, likable characters and hundreds of zombies..I don't want this season to finish! Well done Netflix bring more series like this!"
5704,All of Us Are Dead,"Best zombie web series. The best part of the series was no garbage scenes were there. Like sex, romance. Pure clean movie. We can watch with family. I enjoyed this movie with my family. And completed this series in 3 days. We all loved it a great zombie movie after train to Busan."
5705,All of Us Are Dead,This is actually a masterpiece.. Korea knows how to dissolve someone's heart .. they provide best zombie cinematic with lots of emotions and all characters are frictional..
5706,All of Us Are Dead,This movie is really good i like zombie movies only few seasons are good this season one of tham all actor all story are very good and also very decent production.
5707,All of Us Are Dead,"They were so calm when there is a zombie outbreak happening and some of them aren't even showing fear.. I thought at first that maybe their mind just went blank because of what was happening, but as it goes on they're still showing blank expressions. It's really disappointing to be honest."
5708,All of Us Are Dead,"It was all a hype. I first saw the webtoon but i didnt bother to read it so when i learned that they will make it a series, i was excited. Welll the story isnt interesting at all. 😐 u watch these students make annoying dialogues and most of the scenes are dead or okay to be removed since they do not mean anything to the plot. I skipped a lot of dialogues because it is truly a waste of time. To be fair, the first few episodes are good but the rest is literally to make it long. Imo, they shouldve just made it into a movie."
5709,All of Us Are Dead,"This series is really amazing wait for 2nd season. This is one of the greatest series in netflix and also korea .I am really surprised and So many congratulations all of cast and all of us Dead,s members."
5710,All of Us Are Dead,"✅ Easy plot but the storyline compensates it as a whole
✅ Gore effects
✅ Lead roles (males) and the class president's acting
✅ Properly executed but its very predictable twists and cliché
✅ Mind blowing scientific explanation on how it (zombies) started❌ Character build up
❌ Slow start
❌ Some loopholes like people are aware that they are zombies but they don't know how to kill them and etcetera
❌ Female lead roles' action skills
❌ Ending can be a lot better (I think); a different cliff hanger, maybe. Why would they go back to the same place where they barely survived even if its for a good purpose?❌❌❌ Because of plot armor
It could've been 8, however, I find some unnecessary conversations which doesn't add up to the storyline. Its just there to make the episode longer. 😅Add ons:
I know this is a fiction however the reason why I don't like the ending is because, in a fiction called Hunger Games: Catching Fire, no one would like to play the games for the 3rd quarter quell because it can mean death, again.Train to Busan and Kingdom is very, very good that's why it somehow shattered my expectations specially from the trailer.I can't also help but to compare it to Highschool of the Dead, it is shorter but a lot of things happened (I can let this go because I have to consider the pandemic which limits resources and locations.)"
5711,All of Us Are Dead,"Upon seeing reviews, I've watched it. There's no interesting content. It has the same old zombie plot. Train to busan was a lot better compared to this."
5712,All of Us Are Dead,"Such a cliché plot and unlikable characters. The series doesnt offer anything new. If you have watched any other x zombie movie this one is exactly the same no taste weak plot, weal characters."
5713,All of Us Are Dead,"It's thrilling and fun. In particular, after Kyung-soo turned into a zombie, he was able to immerse himself in the drama. My time melted gently. I was deprived of time. I'm sure you feel the same way."
5714,All of Us Are Dead,Amazing series worth to watch its an interesting series with lot of emotions and fun i really enjoyed it. Forget about bad reviews just go for it.the actors acting is also really good i hope they will make season two of this.i know that koreans never disappoint us while making these type of contents.the visual effects are also really good......
5715,All of Us Are Dead,"Maybe because i've seen kingdom and sweet home, i was expecting something more. There are unnecessary scenes that contribute nothing to the plot. Added sexuaI violence scene of a minor that wasn't in the original webtoon, filmed in a way that was no different from p*rnography."
5716,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm looking forward to it.And zombies are the best
I wanna see next season drm
This is very nice see and fun.I want to recommend it this drama.Hahahahahaha."
5717,All of Us Are Dead,Very well-paced! It was interesting to see zombies all over the school. I couldn't keep my eyes off as the story unfolded.It was so much fun! Trust me.. you will love this series.
5718,All of Us Are Dead,"I finished watching this before giving this review. But tbh......This is a very disappointing zombie movie. I just waste my time, I should stop watching this after 3episodes.Tho the zombie's makeup/effects are nice."
5719,All of Us Are Dead,This was the best zombie webseries i watched untile now and i expect more. Like this .zombie scene in high school was awsome. I was imagening what would i do if was in their position.
5720,All of Us Are Dead,"I always loved watching korean zombie movies and very hopeful while watching this trailer. But I'm so disappointed with this series! I think this is the worse korean zombie I have ever seen. From storyline to the action and movement of the zombie.Don't waste your time watching this series, or if you want to watch it try one or two episodes and you'll know."
5721,All of Us Are Dead,"It is a film that has found value enough to want to write a review despite having to use a translator.Like a Korean drama, the sophisticated film technique and detail stood out.What makes this film more valuable is that it tries to deal with the problems of human society.It shows the gap between the rich and the poor among students in the school, bullying among students, and the selfishness of human beings through it.In a situation where zombies spread throughout the city, the attitudes of each person involved also show the brutality and dignity of human beings at the same time.I feel that this drama asks us a lot of philosophical questions and I want to give it a big score.Through nonstop action, the eyes are not boring, the romance between students is well expressed, and the friendship between people move us.I don't give it a full score because of the boring parts in between, but I recommend this drama."
5722,All of Us Are Dead,I think most bad reviews are from those new Korean drama watchers after squid game. Korean drama and films are always known to have a slow character build up. As it's essential to get to know a character. Having said that yes it's annoying at times with these kiddish behaviour however these are teenagers after all. Regardless I would watch Korean zombies any day. Great show and great entertainment 👌
5723,All of Us Are Dead,"I really think it an excellent zombie TV series. On Douban, an app in China, used to comment on movies or TV series, etc, many people said that it is not so good, even a bad zombie TV series. I totally can't understand it. They think Onjo is too silly. They think the best choice for Onjo is to kill her best friend immediately after they found out that she was infected. I mean, they are just high school students, and she is Onjo's best friend. When the memories between them showed in Onjo' mind, I can't help crying. She was used to be my best friend. How could she be infected??!! I think what Onjo acted is realistic. That's what a normal people would do at that situation, and not just kill her without mercy. So I am quite disappointed about the rate on Douban, just 6.3/10. However, the rate on imdb makes me realize that there are people who use their brain to watch this TV series."
5724,All of Us Are Dead,"I read the negative reviews and it was all like ""Zombie is the same"",""Its just another zombie movie"",""Too long and boring""First of all its a series and this is better than walking dead ""for me""
Walking Dead is great tbh im not saying its trash or bad.Second of all its zombies what do you expect at least they added a new aspect of half zombies that has only been used 2-5 times in movies or series.The scene where Namra jumped off school was so cool
And when Lee cheongsan sacrificed his life in the building.Lastly,They are mostly new actors but look at the outstounding work they've showed in the series."
5725,All of Us Are Dead,"This show was a major disappointment for me mostly for two reasons- annoying characters and forced plot.The characters are so fcking annoying and they lacked enough complexity. I know they are teenagers. Still the writers could have added more depth to their personality.The plot seemed extremely forced- a genius dude wanted to help his son fight against his bullies and ended up creating this zombie virus. It seems a bit abnormal for my sake. The bully surviving even after getting bitten (Though it's explained that some people would turn into half-zombies after contacting the virus) also seemed extremely forced to me. It seemed like the writers did everything to save him for the final fight. I've seldom seen someone getting this much plot armour.Some other reasons for me disliking this show are- lack of a complex villain (the bully was trying to murder people for no proper reason at all), zero to no use of gun to make the zombies seem op (Cops fighting against zombies using shields was so painful to watch)."
5726,All of Us Are Dead,I usually love zoombie themed dramas/movies because of the intense scenes but this was just too cliche and boring. Most importantly I hated almost EVERY character! They just too stupid I cant believe most of them made it so far.
5727,All of Us Are Dead,"Darn this was so amazing
It was so thrilling!! Ofc it's the same old plot about zombies attacking people and biting but what makes its really good is legit EVERYTHING -
Like the character interaction, what all they did for survival and how they saved themselves. The series had people betraying others which made me really mad and frustrated. But it also had amazing characters who sacrificed themselves. The entire acting is amazing and i never got bored. I've been super hyped about it ever since the trailer came and after watching it didn't dissapoint me!! It made me feel soo conflicted and so sad. Really good and worth the hype."
5728,All of Us Are Dead,Overall it was a good drama ...... tears flew from my eyes during all sacrifices......... the survival was epic... But it had too much of blood scene...
5729,All of Us Are Dead,"Going into this, I had admittedly high expectations because the trailer looked so good. Those expectations didn't hold up past the first episode, except for the phenomenal acting. All the characters pulled their weight and felt genuine the entire time. However, that is the only great thing about this show.The plot is infuriatingly slow paced with no character development and even less chemistry between the main cast. There are no stand out cinematic scenes, no fun fight scenes, and as the stakes stay the same the entire time, everything starts to blur together.The creators obviously tried to make statements about human nature, bullying, teenage conflict, teenage pregnancy, etc but all of those plot lines were messy and fell apart with no emotional hit on the viewer.I really wish I liked this show. It had potential, but as me and my friend watched it, the #1 overwhelming emotion we experienced was annoyance. If this show was a color it would be gray-- no seriously it's like they had a gray filter over the camera constantly.I don't recommend wasting your time on this. Even for a background noise show, you can find something actually entertaining and bad in a fun way, unlike this. The end makes no sense and isn't fulfilling either.Thank you for reading :)"
5730,All of Us Are Dead,"I loved the way the series handles school students facing everything from nasty bullying, true friendship, love to questions about life itself. What if you and your friend are hiding from the zombies, quietly in the restroom, and your friend begins to turn into a zombie, would you kill her? Would you let her eat you, because she cannot help herself?I hope season 2 is made as well!!"
5731,All of Us Are Dead,"Good. It is a Korean zombie film that subtly reveals the current reality of COVID-19 in Korea. The situation in Korea is shown well throughout the scene, so if you want to know about Korea, I recommend you watch this movie."
5732,All of Us Are Dead,"Once you get past the second episode it is absolutely amazing!! Episode one and two are too unrealistic. I understand it is just a tv show (it's not real life) but the characters emotions and actions are unrealistic to the point where you don't want to watch it. However, after episode one and two the show becomes absolutely amazing, addictive and enjoyable to watch. Although there are problems with the first 2 episodes I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. And I cannot wait for season 2!!!"
5733,All of Us Are Dead,"The very less important part of this series is the forced division of roles, such as the role of parents of the main female and male characters because it ends in vain, and the role of the police which is considered to give hope, just happens, and along with the death of members per group, which seems forced, even though there is no need why in all episodes must be sacrificed."
5734,All of Us Are Dead,"This show is very good
Teen age drama in me made this even better
An Emotional Touch Development From Esme Joe Characters Is Also Good
And yah show is nothing less than a masterpiece to me
So go and hurry to the show
look at."
5735,All of Us Are Dead,I can give up on my soul to watch this drama for the first time once again. This is one of the best show i have watched so far. And I really am waiting for a season 2. :((
5736,All of Us Are Dead,"I want to take my medicine when someone prays.Please pray for me first to the end of the day.Please forgive me
I have nowhere to look.I want it I want it."
5737,All of Us Are Dead,"Great kdrama, it was nerve-wrecking, horryfying. Love the fact that no character presented as perfect and the storyline reflects many societal problems that we know but usually ignore.Overall, I recommend to watch!"
5738,All of Us Are Dead,"This series is really great, in my opinion, this series has performed great in all the effects and scenes, even in the last two episodes, the sad scenes were made very naturally, which also attracted the viewer to the sad atmosphere of the series. The series was great in every way and made me love Korean cinema more."
5739,All of Us Are Dead,Excellent series with lots of emotions mixed by koreansKoreans really know how to make a zombie flick!Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.Two episodes in and it's mayhen and chaos all over the school!As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.Freaky zombie outbreak like I've never seen before (only in Train to Busan).I can't wait to see how it all plays out.
5740,All of Us Are Dead,It is a good web series and its story is also very nice. The way it is directed is also very good and I want to watch its season 2 And i am requesting watch this series once you will also be a fan of it.
5741,All of Us Are Dead,"I am one of those who read webtoon before, the original webtoon is perfect! The female protagonist isn't annoying and is addictive to male like series. For some reason this turned out to be super power zombie fighting and the most unforgivable part is the fight between normal human vs mutation one. (the mutation is lost by the way lol). The dad of onjo tried to save his daughter bravely but died so wastefully. I strongly recommend reading webtoon. It is much much better. I give this 5/10 somehow I can relate this to the original one."
5742,All of Us Are Dead,"To be honest, the first few episodes were quite entertaining. But the dumb and annoying characters really killed the show for me. One stupid and unnecessary decision after another.The girls act mostly like some annoying, spoiled, and rude wannabe Rambos. And most boys, on the other hand, are some weak cowards without a spine or any integrity. The characters (except for a few) were so annoying to the extend that I was desperately hoping they would get killed.Trash writing and mostly trash characters. What a disappointment."
5743,All of Us Are Dead,The best zombie movie i have seen. Before this my best zombie movie was world wat z. If u have time i recomand u to watch this all at once. I t will bring u horror and sadness.
5744,All of Us Are Dead,"Some scenes do not make sense, like the open wound on a hand being able to infect people being wiped with contaminated cloth yet when the infected blood goes into the mouth or eyes while hanging over the fighting survivors and nothing happens makes no sense. When the survivors were fighting the infected during the barricade scenes, their fingers were exposed and would have easily been bitten off. The scene with the bully not using the girl with the pink shirt as bait while coming out of the supply closet made no sense to lure the survivors and open the roof door instead of climbing the pipe like spider-man. Military fighting scenes should have used silencers on the weapons and night vision. Helicopter should not have had loud engine sound or bright spot lights because it could have used heat signature optics.The survivors should have had more improvised weapons that were deadly, like the drone scene being modified with a gun or explosive as it would have made more sense. For example, the girl survivors had long hair that could have easily been grabbed by infected. During the barricade scenes, the infected would have grabbed their long hair and dragged toward the barricade and bit their necks. The scene with the sound wave drones makes no sense that it did not affect the hambies or half human/infected mutants. The 119 father character only grabbing one gun from the police station made no sense after visiting the armory and would have gotten far more weapons.Too many plot holes occurred such as what happened to the orange vlogger, detective/other cop, and survivors at the concentration camp. The bully kid would have survived falling the fourth time since the height of the school was taller than the construction site. Plus, the bully survived getting PIERCED from the construction site height. It does not make sense the bully would be dead after falling from the construction site (about five stories) compared to the roof of the school building."
5745,All of Us Are Dead,"At first, it seemed boring, but it became more fun toward the second half. I watched it all in three days. It can be said to be the best zombie series. I hope season 2 comes out soon."
5746,All of Us Are Dead,"It was not bad, but because Chong Sung is dead, I give a low grade. But It was worth seeing again and It was fun, but It could still be better and not so sad."
5747,All of Us Are Dead,"I binged watch this and finished the whole series in one day because I got addicted. This movie astonished me and I really like it. Tho I wish there are somethig the writers did add such as when Naeyon apologize to them, the girl , who was filmed while nude, got revenge to Gwinam, the bully, and many more. I don't understand why some people don't like this series 'cause for me it's a masterpiece. I'm really hoping for season 2, for Cheongsang to be still alive and his endgame with On Jo , I wanna see them as couple they are cute. Yes, good actor and almost good writing for me."
5748,All of Us Are Dead,"Idk how people are rating this series with 8 or even 6 and above. Absolutely horrible acting by the cast and honestly the worst storyline...Makes me even more appreciative of ""The Kingdom"" series and the movie ""Train to Busan"", which were so well made with great acting/casting.Gae-no-jam."
5749,All of Us Are Dead,This series is very exciting and unpredictable. The actors were well chosen and played their roles beautifully. The series had a good social critique of the state of society.
5750,All of Us Are Dead,It's not bad overall and has a lot of cool scenes but it get's soooo cringe sometimes that I can't even continue watching it. Some drama parts especially! It's just so cringe. And on the other way there are a lot of bugs in the show. Like who the hell puts new fresh blankets on the roof of a random school? And their clothes and shoes are literally so fresh like they just bought it. To be honest I didn't enjoy it.
5751,All of Us Are Dead,"This Zombie show absolutely DID NOT disappoint! From the very jump you have a scene of a boy being bullied then turns Z. From there it gets a bit slow until about the end of the 2nd episode. I'm glad they showed us what happened and how the Zombies came to be even though it was slower. It showed us some of the students backgrounds, who was doing what, the love interest and gave it us context to to alot of what's going on and why.In one of the scenes they start to freak out once they realize there's zombies at the school and one of them even mentions "".. this is just like train to Busan!"" From that moment I was in love!! Every zombie show movie Iv ever seen they act like they've never seen a zombie film and they're all panicking on what to do. This one they acknowledged the zombies called them zombies and somewhat knew what to expect. There's a twist in how some of the infected act which I'm wondering will have to be a big part in season 2. Don't mind what these low rating reviews are saying it's a MUST watch especially if you're a zombie thriller fan! It just has a little of what everyone likes in a film. 10/10 kind cannot be changed!"
5752,All of Us Are Dead,"Undoubtedly koreans are the best. The story contains everything. Friendship, love, humanity, thrill, adventure, fear, cruelty. What else we need. Could nt find any single flaw in this series. And also each and every scene is delightful to watch. Right from first scene its been a terrific making from koreans. We have to agree."
5753,All of Us Are Dead,"#AllOfUsAreDead Good Story Line Interesting Truns On Story A Diiferent Zombie Show. I Love It To Watch Again And The All Charecters In This Tv Show Is So Good. Zombie, Love, Friends, Emotional Pain Good You Have To Watch It 1 Time In Your Life."
5754,All of Us Are Dead,Sooo[ooooooobad. Please dont WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I WASTED MINE. IT. IS. SO. BAD!!! Every charaxter is mega stupid. Most of the scenes were very awkward and clicheic. I think it is one of the worst tv series that i have watched in my entire life.
5755,All of Us Are Dead,"I was looking forward to this as I am a huge fan of Korean zombie movies. Was very disappointed watching this.If you're looking for a movie with action, well thought out storyline and good character development this is not the show for you. If you are looking for a show about teenage angst and random plotlines that lead to nothing this is the show for you.I would only watch this if there was absolutely nothing else left on your list to watch."
5756,All of Us Are Dead,"It's about 12 hrs long but never let us felt that, very engaging. The cinematography is outstanding whenever there's a chasing sequence, my god it's feels so good, the camera angle. The little love story is good. Hope makers will release it's part 2 very soon."
5757,All of Us Are Dead,It was one of the most beautiful series. We hope they'll make season 2 as well. All the episodes of the series were really good. It's really worth the privileges.
5758,All of Us Are Dead,"I was deeply impressed by the performance of South Korean zombie movie 'Train To Busan' in 2016. The acting of zombie was mind-blown to me. And I was looking forward to another thrilling and breath-taking survival story. However, in this case, the performance of the zombie actors is the only saving grace of this show, the illogical plot and acting of 'the living' have ruined this show entirely.There is one scene in ep2, 'the living' are running away from fierce zombie hordes. They barely make it to a classroom surrounded by glass windows. You heard me right, thin layers of glass window are the only thing between 'the living' and zombie hordes. And yet, they still can turn their back on horde of zombies outside the classroom, fall into an argument with one another for some meaningless, non-urgent issues that nobody cares. 'The living' are acting way too calm that not even a single one of them is having an eye on the zombies pounding on their windows and doors. It feels like they are living in a parallel world, and what is happening outside has nothing to do with them. It is unreasonable and far from what I anticipated.The performance of zombie actors is respectable, I can see they are putting a lot of effort on creating a sense of terror and thrilling, but that is about it. Even the terrifying zombie cannot save the terrible plots."
5759,All of Us Are Dead,"Really a most horrific,most entertaining and most humoric web series that i have ever seen. All actors works are brilliant and that is the reason this web series pre production work is very good. Also post production work are superb. So, it is really a suprb interesting and horrific webseries. Thank you."
5760,All of Us Are Dead,IT'S A FANTASTIC WEB SERIES AS I EXCEPT FROM KDRAMA ZOMBIE SERIES. THIS IS THE ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I EVER WATCH AND BEST IN ZOMBIE. I RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH BUT IT'S EPISODES IS TO LONG CONSIST OF 12 EPISODES.
5761,All of Us Are Dead,"Good action, good zombie performance, but that's all. The real problem of the show is its logic, I will pick a few points to talk about but there's way more. 1. The firefighter fought all the way to the arsenal in the police station, but he only took one gun? Is it really that heavy to take more? More ironically, the only gun he had was taken by a weak man, and he did not even bother to take the gun back! 2. Every time things get a little emotional, the characters had to shout even there were lots of zombies around, its like they were afraid zombies don't know where they are. 3 What's the point of the sacrifice of the firefighter? Could he not throw one or two sticks far to draw away the zombies and then run out fast and then lock the door from outside, I think that's totally possible. 4 The girl had a wooden spike, she could have used it to kill dozens of zombies, but instead she waved it around like a normal stick, if you cant use it right, cant you give it to another man?"
5762,All of Us Are Dead,Thank you so much for these masterpiece. I have seen Many zombie film or series but these series is another level. I enjoyed hole day watching these masterpiece.
5763,All of Us Are Dead,"I must create new account to make a review for this.Again and again, why all zombie movies treat character as no-brainer ? I know that this is unreal world, but character is human, and human has brain to actually think ?What they do ? Shout out to invite zombie to come to them ? Lol, is this joke ?Let's try again, to make this genre better, at least treat character as normal human , is it possible ? Or zombie genre means human is not human after all ?"
5764,All of Us Are Dead,"Actually I love the concept that director use as a high school student becoming a zombie I love the concept Love this series
Please renewed the series for season 2
This is the request form a fan."
5765,All of Us Are Dead,"Binge watched it in 2 days. I love the fact that it had mutations of the virus and kept me on the edge of my seat with some of the episode's cliffhangers.. I'm really annoyed that they didn't seem to even try to find food or water even after acknowledging that lack of water would kill them. However, I love how smart some of the characters were and some of the things they came up with to get from room to room."
5766,All of Us Are Dead,I fell in love with this series from the first time I saw its trailer. I liked it. South Korea is making a lot of progress in the film industry. Thank you for your good films from Iran.🇮🇷🙂❤
5767,All of Us Are Dead,"After getting impressed by Kingdom, I was excited to watch another zombie movie by South Korea and this time set in high school premises. I really loved it tbh.. I don't know why people are giving it lower ratings. It kept me hooked to my Tv all the time... so gripping. Also the zombie action and graphic scenes are amazing n seems real. The zombie makeup is quite good. Although it was really hard to see my favourite characters die. Things you don't expect happened in this series I highly recommend you guys to watch it."
5768,All of Us Are Dead,I don't like how some of the students are so stupid. Less action as well. I like how Koreans make good and hyper zombies but when it comes to some parts of the script? Boring.
5769,All of Us Are Dead,The web series experience was very nice. It automatically connects to teenagers. All characters are revining in my mind. I was cried at last two episodes. Humbly requesting the Netflix to release season 2 as soon as possible. Please.
5770,All of Us Are Dead,I just wanna say that This show is way better than other series .. I just loved it & can't for another season..we need season 2 as soon as possible ....
5771,All of Us Are Dead,"Enjoyed the overall look, story, cinematography and actors. If you're a fan of zombie movies and series that might be right for you, but there are scenes, actions and parts of the series, which are completely pointless and lengthen the series itself to an unnecessary length.This series would have been fine with four to five episodes, but these twelve make it kind of boring and losing interest within its progress. Less is more."
5772,All of Us Are Dead,"For me, the most interesting part of this show is how and why the virus was created.What baffles me is the utter ignorance from on how to deal with these zombies. Even the person who is behind the origin of the zombie seems somehow baffled on what to do...I mean, I think it is safe to assume that the kids who go to this high school have seen at least 1 or 2 movies / series about zombies. Especially since some of the kids refer to 'Train to Busan'.Yet somehow they seem incapable to do what is necessary: smash their heads (and as such their brains) to kill them... or poke a pole through the zombie-brains. The chairs and desks have legs, right? At some point they actually have a broomstick in their hands and still the obvious move somehow escapes them.I have to admit that I have only seen two and a half episodes so maybe at some point things will turn around.Also, if you notice that someone gets bitten, don't just stand around... throw that person out of the window. Don't start a debate on what to do... YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, IT'S THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPS!Sorry for my rant, I just can't see past this very annoying aspect of the series. Maybe it's just and me and I haven't seen enough Zombie-series/movies to make an honest judgement. But COME ON!!!Last but not least, I don't know if we are supposed to feel any sympathy with the characters, but until now there's just not enough background information to feel sympathy towards any of the characters. I like Bare-Su though, at least he kicks some Zombie asses! (but also fails to see the obvious 'scramble their brains' soluytion)."
5773,All of Us Are Dead,I am binge watching this for the second time in a week. Action and drama in a very good balance. Top performances by all young actors. Many interesting sub-plots that are somehow overshadowed by the main story arc: the survival of a bunch of classmates. The concept of how the virus started is brilliant and very relevant to a 2022 take on the zombie genre. The Battle Royale loyals are going to love this.
5774,All of Us Are Dead,"After watching only 4 episode don't think it's a common zombie film. It have action , romance, thriller and what not. Eagerly waiting for season 2. If season 2 doesn't release it will be a disappointing thing but this is sooo good that season 2 will be soon available."
5775,All of Us Are Dead,"Please someone make a zombie show where the characters aren't complete idiots that stare blankly at people getting attached, that don't run like new born baby giraffes and make stupid speeches. This is not a good show, they're all wimps, they take risks for stupid things, they fall on the ground and just lay there for someone to pick them up. Just fight and stop pushing zombies away and why is it taking so long for the dad to get to the school?"
5776,All of Us Are Dead,"Best series of 2022. All of the characters is very Amazing, Specialy Class President 🔥🔥🔥, Love form Pakistan to my South Korean Brothers, keep it up, & I m Now Still Waiting for the Season 2."
5777,All of Us Are Dead,"If you are in a zombie-infested school, survival should be your top priority but not these kids. It would be understandable if the premise of the story is that they are unaware that zombies exist but these kids have sited a famous zombie Korean movie in their script so that would not be the case. After that line, all of the scene just don't make sense anymore. I mean only four people thought of protecting their bodies when going out? Even their concerns and problems are not pertaining to survival but on foolish dilemmas like going to the bathroom hygienically and ending up in a worse possible solution? Hoping it would make things lighter and funny. But honestly It just grossing me out! Who wrote that!? Thinking about food and water supplies for these kids could have been better right? Even the government's concern and decision in this series just don't make sense. Like really?? Maybe the writers can learn from ""Lost in Space"" or ""#Alive""."
5778,All of Us Are Dead,"It starts of great. Its entertaining and I like how its pragmatic about the survival of a zombie apocalypse. The characters start a bit flat, but then develops, which is pretty cool. But now I am at episode 8 and more than 8 hours of watching the show, I am TIRED of countless unnecessary cliffhangers and extention of details in many of the scenes. We don't have to spend 10 minutes watching every main character talking into a camera greeting their parents and so on.And in my opinion, some details of the plot is just stupid, and it's very clear that it has been made this way to make it possible to extend the season to the max. This story could have been told in 10 episodes and i feel like im wasting my time.If you decide to begin watching this show, be prepared to be annoyed."
5779,All of Us Are Dead,Neeeeeeeddddd kooooo ng season 2 at BUHAYIN SI CHEONG SAN plsssa sana mag ka season 2 para mabuhay si cheong san KASE SABE NI NAM_RA THERE BACK SO ITS MEANS NA BAKA SI CHEONG SAN YON AT MAY KASAMA PA SYANG IBA.
5780,All of Us Are Dead,This series show us all emotions of love hate jealousy and still focus on its main plot zombies .... 12 ep 1 hour of each I binge watched it finsh it in single go for 12 hour continous ... the character of each of mai cast connectsand other thing is that the story from the scratch give you different feel .I am eagerly waiting for season 2.
5781,All of Us Are Dead,"I was looking forward to it because it was the original webtoon, but I could feel the zombie costume and the actors' zombie acting was full of tension and fun. I often saw that part because it seems like it was directed by replacing too sensational content such as rape and peeling with school violence. I think the camera's feeling and filter at that time became more immersive!!"
5782,All of Us Are Dead,"Well I wanted to watch this drama because people seem to be really like this. It was okay for first episodes but...WHAT IS THAT? Theare very absurdly designed. I was happy when I saw some of the zombies are different from eachother. But what's the point if you don't use it perfectly? The group has a girl zombie/human on their side but they don't use it for their good. For example, they saw the ""bully"" zombie/human can go anywhere and zombies don't make something to him. Then, THEN WHY THE MEMBER OF GROUP SACRIFACE THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF GIRL ZOMBIE/HUMAN? Just tell her ""go away and make noise while we escape.""
And why the girl in the pink dress survive first in that room and eat/drink what her want, and we saw that she wanted to help and then she died soon after. Why didn't you kill her when she went away with teacher?I can't understand. My English is dead. Lol."
5783,All of Us Are Dead,"This is actually my favourite zombie show after ftwd. Even the title is interesting, that's what brought me to the show and how I started watching it and with that I made othe best decision ever. I was a little sceptical at first but the first episode was when I realised how good and amazing it is. I literally love it so much, it's one of my comfort shows. I cannot even put it to words how much I love that show. I mean the characters are cool asf, the story, plot, how authentic and real it look cus it has a high budget. It's literally too good to be true. I'm really looking forward to a season 2. I really recommend this to anyone who loves apocalyptic movies/shows, k-dramas, zombies and much much more. I literally feel so sad after watching it all and I want more of the show. It's that really lame feeling when you finish your favourite show and just don't know what to do. No spoilers here but it truly amazed me and just everything about it is spectacular. There's literally nothing bad about it. And it was such an enjoyment, I really enjoyed every second of the series and it's easily my favourite show at the moment. A solid 10/10 with no doubts. Recommend it 101%!! Watch it you won't regret it!!"
5784,All of Us Are Dead,"I love the series but my annoyance kept piling up because I thought it was a Korea movie that I shouldn't raise my expectations. Not until I saw squid game, with it episodes less than 10. They tried to make it as real as possible and it became a huge success...Why will a Commander commit suicide because he ordered the execution of a small town so as to contain the virus. Thus saving million.. In US such scenerio are called COLLATERAL DAMAGE.No one would persecute him for that!!!I love the K-drama because they are growing so fast and rapid but 90% of their series makes me so mad at the end. I had to stop watching Lee Min Ho because his movies are too childish and his acting too.. not talking about the good looks.I had to recommend this series to a lot of my colleagues after watching the first 6 episodes... And you guys kept disappointing me thereafter.Especially the zombie bully running around the school, he should have been eliminated.. and some scenes are just too dumb.Like Nam ra father sacrificing himself... Come on, I'm a fictional writer.. some sacrifice are just too stupid likewise Na Yeon mom, that's the most disappointing moment ever.Tz_Chilest."
5785,All of Us Are Dead,I've never seen before like this series. It's amazing show. I really love this series. The friendship the bonding the teamwork and the visual effects and acting. It's really appreciated.
5786,All of Us Are Dead,"During the 12 episodes with a total running time of over 12 hours, the heart rate displayed on the Apple Watch never dropped below 100.The level of immersion is high enough to maintain tension for a long time, and the various zombies that unfold throughout the play made the drama more interesting.I think the zombie acting was more realistic because the actors learned and practiced the zombie choreography from the choreographer for the zombie acting.I'm really looking forward to season 2."
5787,All of Us Are Dead,"RIGHT NOW I CAN'T CONTROL MY EMOTIONS ....No words for this series..
..only one word masterpiece...
Especially i like the best scene is conversation between those friends in school roof top😭😭🔥BTW too much violence."
5788,All of Us Are Dead,"I think the best show i have ever saw in zombies, after the movie Train to busaan this was an epic storyline and the cast were nice.And the best part of this series was that there were two types of zombies (partially we can say that), one is good zombies like Nam-ra as and the other ones are bad zombies.And currently i am waiting for the next season to came.As per my opinion you should go for it to watch this show."
5789,All of Us Are Dead,"As a student, I love how the movie tries to portray real-time scenarios during a zombie apocalypse. I also appreciate the cast's efforts in making this tv series. I hope that there is a Season 2."
5790,All of Us Are Dead,One of the my best series love angle was superb i love it waiting for second season very good story line. First time I tried Korean series it was more than expectations and character of this series were very natural .
5791,All of Us Are Dead,"Nothing can beat this , it contains all things you want , chrachters are too good its awesome. In most series only some episodes are interesting but in "" all of us are dead "" all the episode are so interesting you can't stop watching."
5792,All of Us Are Dead,"The series is really disappointing. It's cliche with borderline cringy lines. It has inferior characters, with plenty of unnecessary scenes. It's such a let down, considering Korean dramas are great with the zombie genre. It has cheap jokes, no good plotline, and overdramatic scenarios."
5793,All of Us Are Dead,"I loved it really. First of all this journal is my fav I love zombie movies,series yeah this is the second k-zombie series which I liked 1-KINGDOM
2- ALL OF US ARE DEAD."
5794,All of Us Are Dead,"Japanese manga did this in 2006 it basically the same thing, the same concept and the character potrate is a tad similar to the manga. I dropped the series in the middle as it resembled the anime which is far better then the series i dont know if the series is inpired by the manga or what but i belive that its not worth the time. Its just a streached version of 24min per ep anime to the 1hr long ep of this series by making the character do the uncanny stupid things. But if you dont wanna watch the anime released in 2006 then its a nice series based on the anime."
5795,All of Us Are Dead,"This series is an excellent series i haven't watch earlier this type of series i love this I want season 2
Netflix if you watch the comments please
I eagerly waiting for season 2
I really love the gang."
5796,All of Us Are Dead,It's wonderful series I can't wait for 2nd session. I finished this series within 12 hours I watched still a night because I can't stop myself to stop watching this amazing series.
5797,All of Us Are Dead,You will really like this web series .The main strong point in this series is the all character have performed their best and it will make audience strongly bond with character.please ye series ko ek baar jarur dekhiye.
5798,All of Us Are Dead,"Its horrible, I didn't enjoy any of it except for episode 1 that's the only reason im giving it 3 stars. It has bad acting for example On-jo never moves her arms its like they're just there, and the shots where they talk it feels like they aren't even talking to eachother. And don't get me on how stupid the characters are especially the students, even though they know what zombies are and everything they never get a weapon, it never crosses their mind to be quiet and in the first classroom it never crossed their minds to block the windows. It has massive plotholes and the storyline is just bad."
5799,All of Us Are Dead,If you want crippling depression this show will give it for sure. It has fantastic writing which builds suspense and has meaningful characters. I would definitely watch this show with someone as it can get really intense. It is never hard to follow and has a solid plot. I enjoyed watching this show even though it did not end like I would have wanted.
5800,All of Us Are Dead,"This Korean TV show just left me wanting more. In fact every episode leaves me wanting more. How do Korean movie directors manage to achieve this hangover effect. The acting is flawless with these kids. And the Zombie CGIs are top notch with gory scenes.Just like HELL BOUND, I am asking 'When will Season 2 be released already'😕"
5801,All of Us Are Dead,"Do not expect a great story as this is far from it. You could leave it as background noise but nothing more.Story and characters were very disappointing to say the least, sadly the start wasn't bad, but bad story telling makes everything go south."
5802,All of Us Are Dead,I literally signed up just to write this review. Some of the characters are so annoying with them being cowards and making very obviously bad decisions and also literally causing unnecessary deaths e.g someone sacrifices their life to help the group by giving them a head start from the zombies just for the group to stand there crying and not running therefore losing their advantage. Plenty of stuff like that. Nevertheless it's a good watch.
5803,All of Us Are Dead,Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .Very good. This very good .
5804,All of Us Are Dead,This is my first and last websiries which i love most with my all time favourite character Cheong San and on jo but i lastly upset very much because se shown die in S1 so i request you sir to please bring the Cheong San in S2 although the movie is very very nice.
5805,All of Us Are Dead,"This series had me similar with Money Heist. Good story line, well portrayed characters and performance. Started the season with great foundation and expectations but fizzled out as the season progressed. Scenes after scenes of similar struggles didn't add much to the excitement. Some characters such as the girl and her baby were unnecessary. The mother and child relationship added little to take a grip of my emotion. A better screenplay and proper editing would have shortened this series by around 3 episodes. And that would have stopped me from getting up from my couch and making coffee breaks. Yes as the season came midway I started going to restroom and making coffee without pausing. And that's not a good sign!"
5806,All of Us Are Dead,I love u nam-ra my favrouite character in the series. The deaths was so sad please surely want the next season 2 of the series plss make it instead the all characters was so fabulous especially nam-ra I loved her acting.
5807,All of Us Are Dead,Great performing and graphics!! Nice how they are being hunted by a Nemises look a like (damaged eye) from Resident evil 3!!I cant wait for season 2.
5808,All of Us Are Dead,Some scenes are extraordinary awesome but they gave some superhuman type powers to some zombies which was kinda unacceptable. The ending part was way too boring and overall it is good...
5809,All of Us Are Dead,"I didn't have any expectations.Concept has nothing new. That's not a problem, a classic story can be very satisfying when executed properly. Think about Pocahontas and Avatar for example. All of Us Are Dead is a mixture of high school drama and graphic zombie gore. It would be good for kids, but the gore frames out the younger audiences. Therefore there's no audience left for this bungle.Gore is used excessively, that might appeal to some audiences. If you enjoy gore and don't care much about anything else, this might be for you. Acting is steady. Usually it's hard to distinguish between bad acting and idiotic character. I believe the series includes plenty of both. Viewer might find depth from characters if he is keen to teen school series. There's nothing more, only sweepy and sketchy moral themes. It's very flat.Nothing really happens in this series. Bunch of flawless looking kids run around in few locations ""surviving"" nearly invulnerably, without any problems such as starvation. The plot seems to be as stuck as the kids in every room they happen to find. Somehow the kids always manage to escape, since the zombies change their functioning according to scene, but the plot stays stuck. There's nothing wrong zombies being stupid. The problem is that the zombie's wit changes dramatically depending on the scene. Sometimes they have excellent pathfinding skills, sometimes they just push straight ahead.Decisions the characters make are ridiculous. A character who is able to escape high security area and withstand and escape national special forces finds it impossible to climb a fence, that many of us have climbed in our childhood, and rather gives up and dies. That's when I found this series is nearly pure excrement.With that budget, it's very sad they produced such a pile of garbage. Knowing that makes it even more frustrating to watch."
5810,All of Us Are Dead,"While the zombie theme has been exploited many times, this show proposes a unique variation. There is a scientific explanation to the zombie outbreak, the whole movie makes perfect sense throughout the 12 episodes."
5811,All of Us Are Dead,Within first 20 min a girl is stripped top less and forced to have a video taken of her by 4 boys as blackmail. Also first 2 min is a bunch of boys beating another boy and the. Throwing him from the roof. These scenes were not mentioned in parents guide and need to be made aware.
5812,All of Us Are Dead,"From start to finish I lived the fact that anyone could die anytime throughout the series, I heard nothing about the series and watched it all in 2 days. Please let season 2 be just as good."
5813,All of Us Are Dead,"Op kdrama, looking forward to season 2. I recommend kids above 10 to watch it due to the following reasons:
1) scary, gory and a bit depressing for small kids
2) has foul language and violence
3) brief sexual abuse, intense bullying and nudity
Though, it's amazing and I loved it."
5814,All of Us Are Dead,"This series just falls into every zombie genre pitfall that there is.Inconsistent zombies? Yup, they will moan and helplessly smack at windows or turn into solid Snake and act as meat seeking torpedo's that will crash through the glass like it's made of paper deepening on what plot demands at the moment.If they are chasing noname redshirts they will catch and devour then almost instantly, if it's main cast they will fumble around, unable to catch anybody. I suspect important characters are coated in invisible grease so they can literally slip out of every bad situation.Survivors are nearly as dumb as undead masses, despite of living in a universe where zombies are established to be part of popculture.Keeping weapons around? Nah, we don't need them.Preventing possible infected from attacking after turning by tying them up or gaging them to reduce chance of being bitten? Who has time for that.Avoiding unnecessary conflicts and keepingnquiet? No need, zombies can't break through anything anyways.Military or police being able to overcome zombie threat with their training and access to proper weaponry? Hell nah, 2 random students with sharpen sticks and another 2 with bows are only force capable of dispatching hordes of infected.Add to that love rectangle (?) with most obvious outcome ever, mandatory ""we found an infant during apocalypse so we must protect it at all cost even though we are on probably most important mission in humankinds history"" sidequest, extremely sluggish pace and virus randomly evolving just to create even more unnecessary conflict and we end up with this.Not terrible but could be so much better."
5815,All of Us Are Dead,"Im not sure why people are rating this any higher than three. Very drawn out and every character is annoying and illogical. Everyone stands around waiting for zombies to get close to them and is surprised that they die? Why are you trying to save friend, mom, whoever if they clearly are a zombie. Stupid. They react so slow to zombies that Im yelling at the screen. And why is everyone the bad guy? A highschool student murdered another because he was on welfare??? Like its laughable."
5816,All of Us Are Dead,"Best series with action and emotions. In this series we actually connected with all characters in the series.lot of emotional scenes
In series but it's ok. Just need the next season as soon as possible."
5817,All of Us Are Dead,Season 2.the characted of nam ra i loved her why she died in the last i want season 2. And all the cast i wanna meet i possible loved u all all of us are dead seoson2 i want plss😎😎😎😎
5818,All of Us Are Dead,"The movie is absolutely fantastic interms of Acting, story, drama.Every character has played a marvelous role.Hats off to the makers of the movie.Eagerly waiting for SEASON 2."
5819,All of Us Are Dead,"Kdrama Well, I like it, the characters are great and it was very impressive. The story of the series was realistic and I liked it. I would recommend it to people who are looking for a series with a different theme."
5820,All of Us Are Dead,"Too many unnecessary scenes and characters. The characters themselves discussed too much ""morality"" to the point where all of the talks became distracting and boring. Yes there are zombies and they run around but at the end of the day no one really knows what messages the series tried to deliver. It's not even that entertaining (again because of all the talks and typical Korean-style drama). There is zero character development or meaningful plot development of any sort. IT IS ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING TO WATCH. SOMEBODY GOTTA TELL THE TRUTH. Sorry to the series, but Train to Busan is a tough one to beat."
5821,All of Us Are Dead,"I wanted to like this show, and for the first 3 episodes, I thought it was alright. The largest problem with this series is that it is just too long (like this review. Sorry.) There is about 6 hours worth of content, but there are 12 hours of screen time.Below are some of the stupid decisions and tropes that somehow manage to make the second half of this show both infuriating and boring at the same time.-The pacing is a glaring issue. There are some great action sequences, but once they finish, the characters sit in a circle and talk for several minutes about subjects that aren't relevant to survival. Every few minutes characters talk about how they like each other, or college. This happens multiple times in EACH episode.For example, they find a video camera and several of the students talk into the camera to their imaginary loved ones. I could understand one person and then maybe a montage of people talking, but they literally show several people talking about things the audience has never seen on screen for way too long.-The main characters are insufferable. The female characters are poorly written, becoming either whiny and useless or unnecessarily cruel and borderline insane. The exception is the main female character, who is both whiny and useless, and also cruel to her best friend that has feelings for her for no reason.-The plot is as follows: students hide in a room. They talk about their feelings and college. They leave that room to go to another room. They talk about their feelings and college. They go to the roof (feelings and college), they go to the gymnasium (feelings and college), they end up on scaffolding in an abandoned building, and still manage to talk about their feelings and/or college. They wander from place to place, which doesn't give the audience a sense of direction or purpose.-They are WELL AWARE of what zombies are/ how to kill them, as they mention Train to Busan during conversation. That doesn't stop them, however, from standing around once someone has been bitten, watching them turn and then freeze when they are being attacked.-When someone in their group is bitten, there is ALWAYS someone who refuses to let the others kill them while they are turning. This leads to several unnecessary deaths, and makes it hard to root for such stupid characters. The main girl literally grabs the arm of her zombified friend after she's pushed out of a window, and refuses to let go of her as she growls at her and tries to eat her.-Some people can get bitten and not fully turn into zombies, which was an interesting premise. Unfortunately, it becomes ridiculous as it gives people superpowers. Immunity from being attacked by the zombies, super strength, super hearing, the ability to jump off a 5 story building and run away. It was bizarre.-The main bully turns into a half zombie with superpowers and goes on a crusade to find the male lead because he gouged out his eye. His powers are extremely inconsistent as he fights the male lead and has trouble over powering him, but other times he throws several people across the room. He manages to find the group several times throughout the series (which become more and more predictable), and is somehow defeated each time by being pushed off of a building like a cartoon character. This happens 5 TIMES. I am not kidding. Every time he finds the group, he's pushed off a roof, out a window, or off scaffolding. When he actually dies because of an explosion, he still falls down a giant shaft!-One of the girls is bitten by the bully and develops superpowers. Even though she is immune to zombie attacks and has super strength, she runs away from the zombies with the group, and stands around while people are being attacked and eaten. They get trapped in a gymnasium and build a protective cage out of nets and other items. While trying to push their way through the crowd, she huddles with the group i instead of clearing a path for them. This obviously results in someone dying.-The action scenes end with someone making a stupid decision and someone dying, or, someone sacrificing themselves. You also have the classic running and falling down multiple times per episode.-We follow the main girl's dad in a sub plot as he tries to get to her. He saves several people and you root for him on his journey. He conveniently opens a locked door that was trapping them in the gymnasium at the last second. The first thing the main girl says to him is ""what took you so long?""
He then dies a few minutes later because he sacrifices himself. Obviously.-There are archery athletes with bows and arrows. After shooting the zombies, they leave the arrows in them and walk away.-At the end they make their way to the survivors camp. They of course sneak out to go back to the school with no weapons to find girl with superpowers.I made an account just to review this. I was almost as angry watching this as I was watching Army of the Dead. That is saying a lot."
5822,All of Us Are Dead,"While I do like this netflix series, there was a mistake on episode 12 wherein Wu-Jin is alive again after he died on episode 11. But they killed him again maybe because of this mistake."
5823,All of Us Are Dead,"Brain-dead, that is.When they don't use their heads, they get eaten.When they try to use their heads, they do it badly, and get eaten.Then they do it again.Slightly less lazy writers could have made the series a banger.The actors and everyone besides the writers did a great job.How many characters is 150?

5824,All of Us Are Dead,"Not usually a fan of zombie genre because I get annoyed by dumb decisions and obvious plot armors. But this one the dumb decisions can be excused because they're made by kids and most of the time the kids are pretty smart for their age and experience. I'm only annoyed by one bad guy being too OP, would've been 9 otherwise.Got hooked after 1 episode and it's interesting to see high shcool drama mixed with zombie outbreak."
5825,All of Us Are Dead,"Boring movie. It brings nothing new and interesting to the zombie movie genre. Foolish actions of the students who don't run away from the school but lock themselves in with the zombies, really?"
5826,All of Us Are Dead,"This is not your everyday zombie flick. The twist is a huge part of it. Acting, directing, cinematography... all top notch. The actor that plays On-jo is a star. That is all."
5827,All of Us Are Dead,Two third of the first episode is just unnecesarry scene about the characters love life and some bully side story but it has absolute no impact later. After 3 episodes of just running around the school i gave up..
5828,All of Us Are Dead,"I could not get past ep 4.I'm sure this is entertaining for the people who can turn off their brain and just enjoy but Im just not one of them.Be warned, some survivers make really stupid decisions, it was painful to watch. Hard to relate or root for the characters because of that.Be warned, some survivers will make some really really stupid decision that are quite painful to witness."
5829,All of Us Are Dead,Looking forward for season 2. The story goes on fast not boring at all. I enjoy it despite some part that bugged me. Some Character's actions are little bit annoying ie. Screaming so loud and keep standing/staring while zombies are coming. And the bad guy got zombie blood in his mouth since beginning(in school canteen) why hes not a zombie?
5830,All of Us Are Dead,"Should've been 8 episodes or 10 maximum. A lot of High School drama should've been on the Editing floor.Good performances by everyone.Scene of Cheongsan and his Zombie mom stood out for me. It was very Heartbreaking.A reasonably well made coming of age teenage zombie action drama. No horror though, did not feel any scare during the whole show. It was Action."
5831,All of Us Are Dead,"This teenage zombie drama really is a piece of work. Usually when series are slow going i use the skip button to go 10 secs ahead in time. I did this from episode 4-12 (probably skipped 75%, and I feel like i didn't miss a thing. Overall the plot was manageable to follow, however far too stretched out. It seemed like these kids were completely braindead - as mentioned by other honest reviewers - and clearly noticeable(!).(Spoilers from here)
There is just too much to say about these characters! This one girl decides to kill a ""Welfie"", a boy who receives welfare payments, by infecting him intentionally (She seemed like a completely normal kid, however is now a psychopath murderer)? The other kid goes carelessly around killing anyone who says something barely considered mean? There is just too much here that doesn't feel thought out.I would compare this to me, 12 years of age, randomly scribbling down all my emotions and fantasies of action, chronologically, without even reading through it twice before submitting to the writers competition."
5832,All of Us Are Dead,"What can I say about this show that hasn't already been said? Well, let me just start off by saying that all the 1 star and 10 star reviews are wrong. This show has some flaws, but absolutely not enough flaws that would make it unwatchable.'All of us are dead' has this unique blend of comedic high school zombie action that, although used before, has not been achieved at this level of live-action television before. During the first episodes of my viewing, I definitely felt the typical ""how can they stretch this out to 12 episodes"", just to be proved absolutely wrong! The first episode is by far the worst, and with this usually being a red flag, it definitely is not here. 'All of us are dead' consumes the viewer, and already by episode 3 you will find yourself deeply attached to these characters, hoping none of them will die (except the bully) only to know that is not true.I believe the biggest strength to this show, is this attachment you will have towards these characters. With a massive cast of high school personalities, nearly all of them have a reason to cheer on their survival.'All of us are dead' often follows some typical tropes of zombie tv, but is filled with enough action and dialogue to make this feel fresh in its own way.If you can ignore some of the rare negative character actions, the not fully fledge out description of how the virus works, and the few repetitive scenes (such as the bully always reappearing again), then this show is a MUST WATCH for any zombie-lover.A complaint by reviewers which I found absolutely unnecessary was that some were shocked when certain characters died. One of the best things to come out of television in the past decade, was the unknownness of death brought on by shows such as 'Game of Thrones'. If you can't work past this inevitability of death, especially in a ZOMBIE show where one bite is the end, then why would you even start a show like this in the first place?Although I was not expecting or hoping there would be a season 2, the cliffhanger at the end makes me fairly certain there will be, and I am ok with that as long as it sustains some originality.Overall, by weighing all the negative and positives this show still maintains a solid 8 out of 10, but due to typical K-drama bashing, fake reviews, and hate due to unexpectedness, I will give this a 9/10!I am already wishing to re-watch it with a friend, just to see how and who they will form attachments too, as character attachment is needed for success!Thank you for this wonderful wonderful show, this was definitely a great way to start off 2022!"
5833,All of Us Are Dead,"Zombie fans, All of Us are Dead does not disappoint.These aren't your slow moving dumb zombies. These are your 28 days later, World War Z infected with advanced rabies type of zombies. High adrenaline, fast moving and terrifying, this show still manages to spend time developing characters and plot.I appreciate the amount of time they take for the zombie infection to spread, addressing issues of democracy while attempting to contain it.Most zombie shows have the infection spread early on and fast, then we're smack dab in the zombie apocalypse.AUAD gives us the perspective of what's happening inside the zone vs outside the zone, with media influence and political strategy.At the same time, this show doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some funny moments, like hearted comedy, and lovable characters along with some villains. It even pokes fun of it's early on, bring up Train to Busan, as they try to figure out what's happening.I'm half way through this first season and I'd say it's a well written show, especially for zombies."
5834,All of Us Are Dead,"I watched it in a single go.Its gory and fun to watch with amazing plot point.I loved how Lee Byeong Chan created the virus in order to save his son, but failed in creating a vaccine, and how it all started with a simple lab rat."
5835,All of Us Are Dead,"Slow, bad acting, boring, unexplained things happen and bad writing and redacting.Instead of enjoying the series, you end up with a super bad day and angry because of that."
5836,All of Us Are Dead,"If you don't mind watching a bad drama talks between two who a horde of zombies are behind and they just need 5 seconds to escape and live but they wasted it on talking about romance while the zombies are waiting for them to finish.If you don't mind a horde of zombies biting someone from the back and when they turn, there's not a single bite spot or blood.If you don't mind watching everyone turn to zombie in 5 seconds except for the main cast they take an entire episode.If you don't mind a person who's seen 100+ zombie biting humans still ask a zombie who's biting someone ""hey stop it what are you doing"" then get scared when they get attacked.If you don't mind watching a total of 2 IQ divided by everyone including the zombies.Then, this show is too good to be true.. for you!"
5837,All of Us Are Dead,"All in all it's got everything you could want from the Zombie genre, while still avoiding some of the more cliche tropes.The characters get pretty good towards the later half of season 1, but early on they weren't all that interesting or likeable.For some reason most characters were constantly bickering, and being class A a-holes to each other for no reason. This got better quickly though, as the characters had a little time to develop.There seems to be a few inconsistencies so far, in who gets affected in what way by the virus, and why, but I expect that to be expanded upon in future seasons."
5838,All of Us Are Dead,"Kinda seems like they borrowed from the anime heavily and just toned down innuendo. On its own merits and typical of Korean zombie films, character development is darn good. I cared about them. Some of the slang and moments of emotion will miss the mark on American audiences. Cultural differences I suppose.I would definitely watch a 2nd season to see how things move forward. Pacing was good after the second episode. It's entertaining and at times campy but I liked it."
5839,All of Us Are Dead,"Sometimes, I have my problems with asian (mostley japanese manga/anime) dramaturgy but I like, that the director tried to walk the line between east and west.But I want to credit the zombie actors, especially the close ups. There must be some contortionists in the cast... never saw this kind of turning. Chapeau! <3."
5840,All of Us Are Dead,Bad acting .......unrealistic plot...and why on earth they never tried to search for water ? Decisions they have taken in a zombie situation have been soooo stupid...waste of time...They all are not dead coz they are Morons...
5841,All of Us Are Dead,"There is no story line, the crew want to keep themselves safe.. the main female character acts so baaaddddddd... But for production need applause worthy... VFX and CGI are really good."
5842,All of Us Are Dead,"The zombie based series!! Whether you are a fan of zombies based series or not, this is gonna get you engaged from start to end. You can't leave it. Each episode is balanced in such a way that you keep on demanding for more and the series keeps you hooked with its twists and turns. Another K-drama after Squid game which deserves everything. Surprised at the rating as this series is way ahead of 7.6 or 8. Deserves 9+ ratings for sure and specially with second swaadon bound to come, a lot to expect. All the characters deserve much appreciation for the phenomenal performance."
5843,All of Us Are Dead,"Unfinished entanglements
Repetitive and boring scenes
Maybe this series is good for teenagers
But it is not good for adults at all because it is very artificial
Do not waste your time."
5844,All of Us Are Dead,This thing is actually pretty slow and boring until episode 3 then the pace really picks up and things start to get interesting. So if you are looking for quick action then skip to episode 3 or the middle of episode 2. I'm now at episode 6 and it's actually pretty interesting now.
5845,All of Us Are Dead,"""Don't listen to the haters"" lol. There is a reason this show has mixed reviews. The story is lacking, common sense doesn't exist, characters are inconsistent with their actions, zombie infection makes no sense, people zombifies based on length of their last farewell speech. It feels like the script was written to purposely annoy viewers.If you're bored and have absolutely nothing to do or watch, go for it. Otherwise, you can skip this one. Go watch Squid Games. Much better than this."
5846,All of Us Are Dead,"The action and effects in this are pretty good and clearly they put some money into it which you then see start to disappear as the series continues. Maybe if they kept it short at 6 episodes instead of 12 they could of keep the money in the right places like hiring writers. The main premise of the story is so stupid once revealed I only kept watching to see how this not ""Train to Busan"" would crash and burn. It's obvious this was made during the great zombie hype of that better movie. They even reference it in the show multiple times like a dumb nod to the fan base. We get it. They watch a zombie move and yet learned nothing from it about survival.Ok so the dumbest part is that the origin of the virus was created by a high school science teacher in response to his son being bullied. You would think ""oh is it to infect the bullies."" No. He infects his son thinking that it will make him stronger and fight, which he shames his son for not fighting back. The school for some dumb reason just lets the bullies do whatever and it's not like it's established that the bullies have rich parents or parents in a position of power in the school. The school just doesn't want the controversy and tells its own faculty members to just let their kids get abused and keep it silent because it will look bad for the school. How does any of that make any sense? The bullies are putting rape videos up online and the school thinks the problem is the victims complain about it because that makes the school look bad not the rape videos. South Korea must be pretty messed up if that's the logic their schools take.So science daddy instead of doing the more logical and doable things, like sending his son to another school, decides he needs to create a virus to help evolve his son but oh no it just turns his son into a zombie and he attacks the bullies back but doesn't infect them and daddy locks him up in his house where he manages to infect his mother who has no lines other than to be a zombie. So I guess she had no say in the whole turn her son into a zombie because he's a wimp against a gang of bullies.So I'm not a writer but I think almost any other explanation for the virus would have been better than the whole dad is motived by his weak son to create a virus. It gets worse when the dad is caught by the police and tells them all the answers to the virus are on his laptop including alluding to the fact that the solution to a cure is on there. He doesn't give them a password so I guess he just leaves all his mad scientist stuff out there on an unsecured laptop in a high school and yet he works at a school where the computers are password protected. Sure lets just ignore that one. Anyway, they get the laptop and there is nothing but stupid videos of him blabbering about nonsense like a dumb incel complaining about the current state of mankind and thus he needed to create the Chad virus so his son would become an alpha. Ugh. They don't show anything that looks like scientific documents or research. The videos on the laptop only concluded that the only cure is to kill them which he couldn't do to his son and wife. So why did he waste everyone's time saying that the only solution was on his laptop instead of telling them there is no cure!This show has a storyline problem like that, where it builds up something like characters are going to have a redemption story arch only to punk out on it, to be edgy I guess. Mom dramatically runs to the school to save her son, they make seem like she will make it but no she gets bitten only to magically show up in time to trigger her son when he's escaping. Karen spoiled girl intentionally infects a poor student because she hates the poors and then once caught the other students exile her but the dumb teacher decides that the girl is worth saving for no reason and locks her in a room with food and water and dramatically tells her to help the other students later while she is getting eaten by zombies. Spoiled girl could have opened the room at any point when she could hear that the students were in the other room but she kept quite and barred the door. She only had a moment of empathy way late in the game when she decides she's going to go to the roof and help the other students with food and water only to be instantly killed by the half zombie bully in another denial of redemption. I could go on and on there are a million story lines like that.I knew it was going to get extra dumb once they had the bully, the rape victim, and the class president be the ONLY ones to come back from the dead and be half zombies. Of which they keep the bully around until the 2nd last episode to just show up many times for dramatic nonsense and fail and keep trying to kill the one guy who he has a grudge against for bashing out his eye and throwing him to the zombies because he was defending himself, oh and he defended the bullying victims once. I really thought they were going to have an epic battle with the bully vs. Rape victim but instead they made her crazy and destroy all the cellphones to try and stop her rape video from being automatically shared on social media, which wouldn't stop a scheduled post from being posted. She was on the top of the building literally watching 3/4 of her school running around as zombies and she's afraid they will see her rape video and judge her. THEY'RE ZOMBIES! It makes zero sense for her to have any motives like that. The show just needed a way to get ride of the cellphones so the kids couldn't call for help. They immediately destroy one computer after facebooking what's happening for one second and then yay all phones and internet get cut by the military because they have that power and over react to a prank video. There are so many better ways they could have handled the cut off of communication but they choose every dumb way possible to do it. Military has a million drones but only decides to use them to lure zombies to a spot to drop bombs. Nowhere did they even try to use them to find survivors and they tried to make it seem like some military conspiracy to be incompetent and murderous for no reason.Then the last episode ends everything in the dumbest way possible. One of the girls can easily sneak out of this heavily guarded and monitored military quarantine zone they have been in for four months now and goes up to the mountain I guess is a few feet near by and can see a small fire on the school roof from what looks like miles away, as if you could even see the light from such a small fire that distance. They decided its the half zombie school president sending a message so they decide to sneak out and go the next night. It is literally miles away through the woods and they can magically travel the distance they had a hard time navigating in the sun light on their way out of the school. Like we are really supposed to believe that they can travel all the way there and back and sneak back into the quarantine camp in one night. Then school president shows up and suggests there are more like her and just jumps off the roof like she's superman even though they established the half zombies aren't invincible. This show was written by zombies I'm done."
5847,All of Us Are Dead,"Love these Korean zombies series fast paced great action what not to love about it . Why better than British zombie movies . I want more. Don't understand negative reviews , not to be taken to seriously delicious fun everything you want in zombie series ,prefer films myself but this one of the better series I have watched."
5848,All of Us Are Dead,I finish this series in one day 😂 to be honest it's very catchy and thise who dislike this zkdrama after watching 1-2 episodes imma advice you guys to take your time and give it another shot because it will be worth! Good and interesting things happen on the middle of the show not at first! You have to be patient. I can't wait for season 2 already if there is gonna be one but i hope yes! I'm obsessed!!! 10 stars from me.
5849,All of Us Are Dead,"Bad acting all round. I hate it when everyone just stop and stares and wait for the person to turn to a zombie before doing anything at all.....
Not enough passion from the characters they all seem way too relaxed..."
5850,All of Us Are Dead,"The vibe I got from the trailer was that of a censored version of The highschool of dead anime. However, its superior in every aspects. Even though the story has a major plot hole but the background score, cinematography and stunts completely filled those voids. The sense of story telling with the aspect of time is a major win for this series. But the prospect of a thick plot and dense character study looses all its volume with a hurried ending. I would not say that its a ""must watch"" but a ""good watch"" indeed."
5851,All of Us Are Dead,"Irritating Characters, Slow moving storyline and Horrible Screenplay are few of the many flaws..Had the potential for a good movie but it was stretched to become a 12 Hrs of struggle."
5852,All of Us Are Dead,"They are staring zombies. I got bored from the long stares. They are zombies!! What are you looking? Just run! Not good enough, i am disappointed. Why 7.8? Interesting rating!"
5853,All of Us Are Dead,"Intense and doesn't let up. I had to stop a few times to take a few breaths.The perfect zombie flick, except it is 12 episode long. Koreans do indeed do zombies justice.Ignore those naysayers, just watch it. At least you'll get the ride of your life."
5854,All of Us Are Dead,"This is a good show but it had me frustrated a couple of times. I think it has a lot of cool action and chase scenes. Su-Hyeon pulling off some martial arts moves never gets old, neither Cheong-san running through dozens of zombies. The setting is very cool. The acting, the characters being high school students and acting like one were some other strong points about it. But I couldn't help but get disappointed near the last 3 episodes.Well unlike another Korean zombie flick, Train to Busan (which isn't a perfect movie either), most characters do not really develop themselves. Apart from the class president making friends with others and being a nicer person (thanks to On-jo and Su-Hyeong) I didn't notice any major changes. Again, there was a lot of tear-jerking moments as it is in Train to Busan, but they take too much screen time. On top of that, some of these sad scenes are focused on very insignificant/less known about characters which makes it a hundred times more boring to watch through. Nevertheless it is a decent show and I can't bring myself to not like it. Seven out of ten, could have been much better without the drawn out tear-jerking."
5855,All of Us Are Dead,"Started pretty well, but that posh b@#*# in the pink top just ruined the whole show for me...Too bad as it seemed to be unique even if it is a zombie movie."
5856,All of Us Are Dead,"I haven't had one of those ""just one more"" until 3am tv shows in a while.It's so well done, you feel like you speak Korean -it flows seamlessly. Moments of laughter, moments of bawling. It was just great.Nothing scares me more than running zombies. Refreshing take on a virus, just great.One downer was sometimes it was a bit slow. Otherwise fantastic."
5857,All of Us Are Dead,"It contains many issues that Korea has. I couldn't stop thinking about Sewol Ferry when kids were not saved by their own country and it broke my heart. I think the plot is great but it could have been much better with writing, acting and editing."
5858,All of Us Are Dead,How can you rate one out of ten and state in your review that you only watched ten minutes?This is very well made with great acting and direction. It reminds me of the first season of Walking Dead for its edge of the seat action. Some nice twists on the whole zombie idea also. I can't wait for the next season.
5859,All of Us Are Dead,Was a little bit more than just your standard zombie show. Had some rather funny parts too but by the end of the series the protagonists were all so unlikeable you actually just hope the zombies eat them.
5860,All of Us Are Dead,"Violent sexual assault. Extreme bullying.But perhaps worse was a (presumably) real person's review stating that women should be ""rightfully so"" broken in half."
5861,All of Us Are Dead,"Stupid, incomprehensible. Addictive. Guilty pleasure.The characters are incomprehensible , unsympathetic and weepy. The action is nice. Nonetheless i couldn't stop to watch it, like a bad accident you can not look away."
5862,All of Us Are Dead,"This is good not a long review but i must say they should have followed the anime more accurately it would be fun ,please go and check out the high school of the dead also first and compare for yourself."
5863,All of Us Are Dead,"I love zombie movies and series! And I was so excited to watch all of us are dead, but unfortunately I ended up very disappointed. The very first thing that happened is they mocked Christianity, and as a Christian it doesn't feel very nice, but I decided to give it another chance. I continue and it gets pretty exciting. But I started to get frustrated, the characters keep making stupid decisions, they are so slow to action, and continues to fall ALL THE TIME, even when there is no reason to fall. It's okey one or two times but after a couple of times it just gets tiring. If you love zombie movies like me, you should watch it just for the sake of watching it, I meaning they did a good job and the zombies are fast and threatening, but don't expect the best show of all time."
5864,All of Us Are Dead,"I'm literally wondering why everyone is willing to sacrifice instead of thinking of a better solution in a zombie apocalypse. I don't usually watch K-dramas but I just wanted to see zombies walking & running all the time & stuff like that. I don't wanna see dramas in thrillers. Why don't the hybrid zombies, superpower men don't bite the other ones so that they'll all be ok?Wait, I haven't seen such a thing and always wanted to see it, just loved seeing kindergarten kids in zombie forms. That part was so cute & satisfying at the same time!"
5865,All of Us Are Dead,"This serie is clearly an adaptation of Highschool of the dead Manga series which sadly stopped. After the first couple of episodes I like it a lot, the acting is very good. Zombies are superb as you might expect from Korean Zombie genre."
5866,All of Us Are Dead,"I was hoping like everyone if the series is of same universe as of train to busan but it isn't, this series is so dumb and cringe and just like anyother horror or zombie movie, characters instead of running away from fear runs towards it, everything looks so annoying that I couldn't watch it,just horrible."
5867,All of Us Are Dead,This is definitely an amazing fun flick. So many good things and the direction is good. Characters are so good with acting and body language. Nice gore and bloody zombies. Good makeup and sweetly satisfying show.
5868,All of Us Are Dead,"Koreans have been making some pretty decent stuff lately, biggest example squid games. Last few years they been making some great stuff. This year they already came out with 2 different shows including this one im writting about. This was pretty well done, had some flaws with it that is considered tv show mistakes. Had lots of things I remember thinking why can't he do it but she can? So some flaws they did not see but other then that had decent story pretty good characters not huge development on them but still had some, id consider this show more action but was still really good and always kept my attention. Im really bad at reviews and writting in general so I hope people really looking for an awnser can understand what I was trying to say ( if not clear)"
5869,All of Us Are Dead,"One of the best zombie series out there. Don't believe ,check it out. Let me tell you Zombie isn't my thing. I'm shocked how I fell in love with the series.(I suck at reviews , hope you get wht I mean to say)The characters are so well written and so well played, one can clearly see the human behaviour and how they change according to situation.The friendship ,the way the characters stepped up sacrificing themselves for others , so selfless , so bold and so touching. Every character has it's deapth ever sacrifice had it's meaning , totally touched by this series , I wish you wld too.( P.s - I'm in love with the character Lee CheongSan , man hez the real hero )"
5870,All of Us Are Dead,As with all Korean shows there are things that have to be ignored if you're not Korean yourself like the main characters arguing over how a junior student in the school spoke to a senior one when there are Zombies trying to break down doors and kill everyone.Moving on from that the show has very good production value and special effects are on par with anything else out there.The characters are engaging and make you feel everything from happiness to sadness and everything in between. The show keeps you invested and you can never be sure who the next person to be killed will be. The cast is very good and fully engaged in what they do every min they are on the screen which in turn keeps you engaged as well.The only criticism is that some episodes are somewhat samey and in effect become fillers. They show could be a minimum of 2 if not more episodes shorter and still have the same impact.Final verdict is that while it's not by any means ambitious or life changing but in my humble opinion well worth watching.I binged it over one weekend and quite a happy camper.
5871,All of Us Are Dead,Sound and act and speed of zombie like clickers in Last of us game! No Creativity.story poor and thin. Hourly creation decisions.for example why Le Cheongson's mother in spite of know exactly deadly zombies go to school with no plan.part of cafeteria in high school more funny Instead horrible.human and zombies slip like Charlie Chaplin in his moveies! I think 6 is enough for this show.
5872,All of Us Are Dead,"After watching so many zombie movies and series, this one doesnt have anything new and exciting to offer. The characters have no depth and the scenes are predictable and not believable. All of the episodes are just endless acrobats and running around. It such a shame because some of the actors are actually good."
5873,All of Us Are Dead,"I've always been a great fan of zombie shows, and was totally looking forward to this! Loved Train to Busan, Kingdom and had high hopes for this.Love
This show has great make-up effects, a fair amount of humour, and an interesting storyline. Story was unpredictable, and had good twists and turns.Hate
But throughout the movie, I felt irritated so many times by the poor decisions made by the characters - like seriously questionable kinds that resulted in unnecessary sacrifices.Overall a good show, but 4 stars deducted from that."

6590,Kingdom,"Review of Season One:KINGDOM is the second top-notch zombie production to come from South Korean, following the film TRAIN TO BUSAN. This one's a six-part Netflix miniseries that explores a zombie outbreak during the Joseon dynasty. The series is a strong mix of GAME OF THRONES-style political intrigue and plotting with plenty of zombie action; the zombies themselves are fresh and frightening, thanks to some twists with the mythology and 28 DAYS LATER-style speed and ferocity. Netflix have really gone to town with the production values here and many of the visuals are good enough to make framed prints. The scenery and sets look luxurious and the costumes are brought to life in glorious colours. A small but distinctive cast, including Doona Bae, play characters with depth and humanity. In between the zombie attacks there's endless plotting, twisting and oodles of suspense, while the stand-out set-pieces in episodes three and four are among the best I've ever seen. Needless to say, I can't wait for season two...Review of Season TwoThe second season is a slight step down from a first, but only a slight. The zombies only really pose a threat in half of the episodes and for the rest the new focus is on political intrigue, which is present times ten. I found some of the plotting to be slightly over-elaborate; the whole issue of the queen and her child was already fully explained in the first series, but seems to take up a lot of space here. Plus I always find flashbacks to be a slightly lazy way to pad out the story; GAME OF THRONES and BOARDWALK EMPIRE suffered from them too. Otherwise, there are still great production values, strong performances and expert choreography to enjoy, and a left-field twist at the climax ably sets up a very differently toned third season."
6591,Kingdom,"Set in Korea's Joseon Period when, shortly after the king is taken ill, a mysterious plague starts to threaten the nation. The remains of a doctor who had died shortly after treating the king were eaten by starving peasants and shortly after they became ravenous zombie-like creatures, attacking anybody they see, spreading the condition. Crown Prince Lee Chang, the King's illegitimate son, starts to investigate. Rumours spread that the king is in fact dead and that the Queen's family is waiting for her to give birth; hoping if she has a son he will be the next king not the Crown Prince. When the Crown Prince is declared a traitor the army is deployed to find him.If you are a fan of zombies but feel most films/series are just more of the same these days this is a must see. Those infected by the plague might not follow all the standard zombie rules but the way they move at speed and as a mass adds to their scariness. These beings also are apparently unable to go out in the sun and seek shelter at night; this leads to tension rising as dawn approaches. The setting adds to the feeling that this series is something new; not just a different country but also an historical period that provides different problems to our own, notably the rigid hierarchy and palace scheming. The combination of court politics with zombies might seem an unusual mix but they work to give a great story. Everything looks great with beautiful scenery contrasting with the brutality of the action. The cast is solid, most notably Ju Ji-hoon, as the Crown Prince; Bae Doona as Seo-bi, a physician researching the plague; Kim Sung-kyu as Yeong-shin, a mysterious tiger hunter; and Kim Sang-ho as Mu-yeong, the Prince's bodyguard. The main plot lines are nicely wrapped up after two seasons but new details leave things open for a third; I have no idea whether there will be more though. Overall I'd say this is definitely one to watch.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles."
6592,Kingdom,"I was recommended to watch ""Kingdom"" by a friend, as he knew I love everything zombiesque, and somehow the South Korean horror drama ""Kingdom"" had managed to elude my radar.With ""Kingdom"" readily available on Netflix, I sat down and watched all 6 episodes of the first season in rapid succession. While ""Kingdom"" is no ""The Walking Dead"" in a South Korean interpretation, it is still a rather enjoyable TV series because of equal parts zombie action and storytelling.""Kingdom"" is somewhat hindered by a rather slow pacing, that while it definitely helps the movie and story, it just made me feel that it took the series forever to get up in gear and to become good. But the slow pace was necessary, I suppose, because it helped establish the character gallery quite well, while offering bits and pieces of adrenaline-filled segments to the audience of things to come.While ""Kingdom"" is not following the average (and generic) zombie formula, it is still a very enjoyable show and it is an interesting approach on a zombie outbreak. One thing that I am usually not enjoying is agile, fast and running zombies, but it actually works quite well in ""Kingdom"" for some reason.This is a TV series where zombies are a part, yes, but it is not a TV series about the zombies. No, this is a drama about well-defined and nicely portrayed characters and their quests for survival, hunger for power, revenge, political plays and such.The TV series have a very nice ensemble of casted actors and actresses to portray to the various roles and characters in the show. I was definitely more than pleasantly surprised to see Doona Bae (playing Seo-bi) in the show, and she brings with her a lot of grace.The zombie make-up is adequate, and it serves its purpose quite well. As stated above, this is not a TV series about the zombies themselves, so it is not richly endowed with gross and ghastly special effects displaying gore and other such grim things that are often a major part in the zombie movies and TV series. Was that a good thing or a bad thing? Well, naturally as a massive zombie fanatic I would like to see as much blood, guts and mayhem as possible, but the toned down brutality and gore of ""Kingdom"" actually suits the theme and atmosphere of the TV series quite well.The downside to ""Kingdom"" is the slow pacing of the story. While it was a mere 6 episodes running just short of an hour or so each, it felt much, much longer. But it is hardly a deterrence for me to shy away from season 2 if it should make its way to Netflix.""Kingdom"" is definitely well worth watching if you are a fan of the zombie genre, and need something to fill the time in between other zombie shows."
6593,Kingdom,The Zombie and chase scenes are very exciting. The production is lavish and the sets are grand. Actors are good too including Doona Bae. The crown prince is good too. The historical story is interesting so it is a good blend. The zombie logic and explanation are quite plausible. A few faults. Many characters look alikeand dress alike. Confusing. Some middle episodes are a little dull. The first season isn't enough at all - it's just like half a season. You have to watch both. In the first season too much was in the dark. Improved in the second season.
6594,Kingdom,"It hasn't been a mystery that South-Koreans can make very good movies but now Kingdom shows that they can also make quality shows as well. Kingdom is only two short seasons long (plus an additional long episode that came out in 2021 called Ashin From The North) but it's addictive to watch. The cinematography is just on top, and the acting for Asian standards is certainly not bad. Okay you have the occasional overacting from a couple actors but overal it's all very well done. Like Sang-ho Yeon's Busanhaeng (Train To Busan) the zombies are just something different than the usual thing we're used to. South-Korean zombies don't wander around slowly looking for brains like in American movies. Here they run like they are the next Usain Bolt and that what makes it suspenseful. The make-up is all very convincing, credits to the make-up artists for that. I binge watched the two seasons in a couple days followed by the extra long episode from 2021 which explains a lot in the end. You don't necessarily have to watch the extra episode but it's of the same quality and certainly worth watching. Kindom is another example why I love South-Korean cinema. They are the best from all Asian countries and that by far."
6595,Kingdom,"Hell yes! The characters are interesting, the concept of zombie apocalypse in a medieval era and very well found, and the political intrigues add to the tension all the way. A beautiful little South Korean masterpiece that has nothing to envy to big Hollywood productions."
6596,Kingdom,"Kingdom: Set in 17th century Korea, a tale of court intrigue and Zombies. Some great Zombie Horde scenes, sword fights and battles. Just finished Season 1 (6 episodes). 9/10. S2 arrived on Netflix yesterday.Season 2 of Kingdom is just as good, the Zombie Horde scenes are perhaps even better. The palace intrigue continues along with Civil War. 9/10."
6597,Kingdom,"Zombie theme been filming like 10000 times but this one totally unique and special. Once you watch the first episode, you can't stop. It's just amazing for all the chasing, killing n most importantly the storyline. Can't wait for season 3."
6598,Kingdom,"Season1
A series that deserves much more success. A season 1 too short unfortunately, but six intense episodes. The cast plays very well (there is Bae Doona, an actress whom I like very much!), The characters are interesting, the concept of zombie apocalypse in a medieval era and very well found, and the political intrigues add to the tension all the way. The best zombie show I have seen, personally. A beautiful little South Korean masterpiece that has nothing to envy to big Hollywood productions.
.......................
Season 2
Kingdom doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does add new twists to the zombie mythology by introducing the quasi-vampiric nature of its flesh-eaters."
6599,Kingdom,"2020 #230:THE KINGDOM S2 (NETFLIX)Surprisingly the story comes to an end with this season and leaves an opening for a third which I desperately need to see. Whereas the original had terrific, intense horror action setpieces and a fare amount of setup. This is pretty much all battle with some truly crazy ass twists. If your a fan of train to busan definitely check this series out its fantastically entertaining.4.5/5"
6600,Kingdom,"Train to Busan rates as my favourite zombie movie, well this definitely rates as my favourite zombie series. So much more sophisticated and fascinating than The Walking Dead as an example. No surprise given the excellent offerings out of Korea.Cinematography, costumes, makeup, plot, script, acting. Soaring!! This is seriously top drawer on any level.The intricate plot has so many social subtexts and complexities that it will fascinate even the most demanding critic.A must watch and I definitely can't wait for Series 3!!!"
6601,Kingdom,"First season awesome surprise.
2nd one was not able to finish, lost interest in the developments of the story.
maybe I retry 2nd season again.
zombies fan do not miss season 1!!!
try 2 episodes.
cheers"
6602,Kingdom,"With so many zombies movies and shows, it's surprising to see fresh ideas that are smart and entertaining.Kingdom was an excellent show. I loved the setting, in which the plague happened during the old time where monarchy and royal blood were the real deal. Going straight to the theme here, the show did not focus on the zombies, but instead showing the humans as the real monsters. The plague was just an opportunity to show the injustice and abuses from those near the throne. This is similar to The Walking Dead, which also showed the worst in people.The main character, the Crowned Prince, was the grand opposite to the royals. He was similar to those shounen protagonist in anime, but because of how evil the other royals were, I couldn't help but rooting for him to take his rightful place on the throne. Other characters were good as well. Some of the deaths were heartbreaking or great sacrifices that showed how loyal some of the characters were.The premise behind what caused the plague was entirely new that I did not expect. I wasn't entirely sure if this is realistically possible tho.Korean zombies always have unique and scary looks, and their designs were again great in this show. Despite not being super gory, the running and aggressive zombies were still scary and heightened the urgency.Overall, an intense and thrilling zombie show. 8/10 for season 1 and 9/10 for season 2."
6603,Kingdom,"Historically set Korean Zombie series. To be honest the acting is descent, the storyline solid and they have thrown cash at it.
But they do have the craziest hats!"
6604,Kingdom,A special feature-length episode and a sidequel to the second season of Kingdom. An invigorating and satisfying revenge thriller with a staggering performance by Jun Ji-hyun.They better be not make Ashin as a villain in the upcoming season. I want her to be the main star of the series from now on.
6605,Kingdom,"I'm halfway through this now (having a hungover lazy day!) and I'm liking this. Episode 1 is a bit slow but then it picks up. I'm drawn into the story so that's good. Now, to see this bad boy through to the end! 7/10"
6606,Kingdom,"I watched 6 episodes for 6 hours in one spot. Gosh, I was so absorbed by the story, and it felt like 2-hour movie. The power of well-knitted story and the attractiveness of supporting actors fulfill the series.Korean settings and the cinematography to amplify the beauty are pleasure to watch. Especially, the costume is realistic and symbolic as well. The sadness behind characters is applied to the costume."
6607,Kingdom,"Just when zombie films may be headed over the hill , we get this fresh , beautifully rendered, exceptionally acted drama . This action is well paced , the violence makes sense , the plot , costuming and setting are gorgeous.
If you are a fan of the genre do not hesitate to watch this . If your new to the genre , this is as good as it gets serving as crossover series: drama , suspense, character development and world building."
6608,Kingdom,"This is the best Zombie series, I have ever seen. Calling this series as Zombie would be wrong. It has thrill, mystery, suspense and everything that I usually looked into series. It kept me edge of the seat whole time even I couldn't blink. My words won't be enough if started praising for it. I can't wait to watch its new upcoming season."
6609,Kingdom,"The concept of feaudal Japan with lone wolf samurajs and zombies Is a cool one.
But like every japanese/Asien zombie production they fail 100% and makes It look like comedy instead of horror.
All these overacted twitching transformation scenes are hilarious.
Some turn to zombies in 5 seconds getting bitten in the foot. Some slowly transforms. Kingdom has a Really poor sense of pacing like all the other movies and tv shows on netflix, monsters, alive, train to busan etc.
Whats worse is that all zombies are running really fast in this show. Its not scary and its not realistic at all. I give this 0/10 cause of the high score it doesnt deserve. I could only watch 2 episodes before knowing where this was going.
Kingdom could have been far greater If it looked like 16 assassins and had kurusawas poetic charm. Real dawn of the dead zombies
And better samurai heroes. Not these loosers you dont care if they all die."
6610,Kingdom,"As a 7-year fan of Korean drama and movies (which Netflix introduced me to back then), I'm delighted to see so many westerners love ""Kingdom."" The Korean writers, directors, production crew, and actors took the tired Zombie genre and recreated it (as they also did with the movie, ""Train to Busan""). They can do it all-historical, detective, war, comedy, fantasy/Time-slip, romance, etc, and are the best filmmakers in the world today."
6611,Kingdom,"I like the premise a lot.The zombies are conceptually sound.The characters are intriguing.However, characters choices are often so questionable that it detracts from the excellent plot.Very much: If you would have done this, we could have been there. But now we're here. Struggling."
6612,Kingdom,"Zombie flicks are an overdone subject around the world for the past two decades. Most of the zombie movies today have become very predictable, lethargic and boring but Kingdom totally stands out in an ocean of zombie titles, in fact this could be the best ever zombie flick ever produced. The series is intriguing, gripping and intense throughout, with a touch of humanity sprinkled within. Kingdom is actually two different stories of different genres beautifully knitted together by some excellent writing.Cinematography is excellent, with some exceptional camera work during intense action scenes. Editing is very straight to the point and doesn't drag much. Production design, costumes and makeup are decent throughout the series. Screenplay is excellent, especially for the first season as the thrill element doesn't fade one bit. Director Seong-hun Kim excels and keeps the momentum going. Ji Hoon Ju and Bae Doona have done some wonderful acting, ably supported by good performances by the supporting actors.Overall, Kingdom is a must watch for all horror and thriller fans that is completely binge worthy. The run time is just under 5 hours each season, so it's a quick watch. I am not a big fan of zombie movies, but I really enjoyed Kingdom from start to finish. The series truly lives up to the rating on IMDb. 8/10 for the first season and 7/10 for the second season to a overall 7.5 stars out of 10."
6613,Kingdom,"I was iffy on watching this because off all the mixed genres. I was expecting an Asian version of 'Pride & Prejudice' with Zombies.But it's all mixed very well, drama, mystery, thriller, horror with Zombies AND politics, all told in a period setting hundreds of years ago.Believable story with good characters. Well produced too. Get watching."
6614,Kingdom,"I simply cannot fault this.Those who say Hollywood take notice are correct. Of course, it won't. We need another series about a serial killer in London at the turn of the 20th century. Or Fast and the Furious 16"
6615,Kingdom,"There are so, so many zombie movies and even shows around these days. I feel like the zombie craze here in the states is winding down, but you never know. Especially when there are fresh takes on the subject like this series.Like many standout examples of a genre, there is a lot here that is familiar to fans mixed with fresh ideas that liven up the concept. Zombies here follow fairly standard rules when active: a bite is always (eventually) lethal, the death of any infected person adds to the zombie ranks, zombies lose any human characteristics and become maddened beasts who hunt for uninfected to consume, and traditionally lethal wounds only slow them down but things like cutting off their head will kill them permanently.But they've added a lot that's new and interesting. For starters, zombies are only active at night; during the daytime they revert to your basic corpse. This gives survivors a fighting chance, especially since the zombies are of the fast variety, sprinting rather than shambling. And the plague, instead of being some accidental catastrophe, if brought forth quite purposefully to fulfill certain ambitions and simply gets out of control. Also, the show goes where many films and shows fear to tread with the idea that no one is safe, not even cute little kids or even babies.But the biggest addition, of course, is the setting. Instead of it all going down in the 21st century, it's instead taking place in feudal Asia. This is a nice touch, allowing them to blend some court intrigue with a more primitive society that doesn't have access to secure bunkers or cement buildings with doors you can chain shut. Most everything is made out of wood and enough attention can allow the dead to bust in to just about any hiding place, elevating that 'nowhere is safe' feeling.The series is well acted and set pieces seem authentic-ish for the era. Costumes and makeup are similarly high quality. But my personal favorite aspect concerns the writing. Films and shows like this often have a message or theme they are trying to convey like 'we work together and live or go it alone and die', for example. Particularly in foreign productions, I have often noticed that subtlety is not prized, and you often feel like you're being lectured at. But here the writers definitely have a message, but they also have the patience to let that message emerge organically from the story.I don't know if it's a Netflix production or from Korean television, but I saw it on Netflix myself. There are subtitles available as well as foreign language dubs that, at least for the English language one, seem pretty well done. I'd recommend.Edit: Although I'm a fan of this show and eagerly look forward to the next season, I did hear one disturbing thing. Apparently one of the crew members literally worked himself to death during the making of this show. Netflix, I'm disappointed in you. That kind of sweatshop crap would never fly here in the States (well, mostly never), so don't allow it on your productions elsewhere, even if there is an established culture of unhealthy work hours wherever you produce your material. You have a responsibility and while I love that you are exposing audiences around the world to different cultures, you still need to be an ambassador of the kind of values the world needs, including a healthy work-life balance and fair labor practices."
6616,Kingdom,"This fairly obvious connection only slowly dawned on me, because the zombies (wights) in Game of Thrones play a less central role, even if they represent the oncoming winter. In Kingdom, the zombies are a constantly threatening presence, and are conceived more as a form of plague (highly appropriate in the era of COVID-19), rather than the antagonists of a cosmic struggle, as in Game of Thrones (which is admittedly also appropriate in the current cultural environment!)"
6617,Kingdom,"And hit a home run.Originally planned to only watch one episode last night.. Then I found myself up until 6am finishing the entire series. I have not felt compelled to binge a show in one sitting in quite some time. Let alone a foreign series.I'm not going to get into the beautiful production, convincing acting and superb multiple story arch's unfolding.I'm just going to say, if you like horror and feel like the genres become redundant in recent years. Watch this. It's like one of those mishmash of genres you think in your mind would be great, and wonder why no one's ever done it. Well now someone has"
6618,Kingdom,"This show definitely deserves the hype it receives! The acting, storyline, cinematography, and special effects, are all amazing. I binge watched this because it's way too good to not! Kudos to everyone involved in this project for creating such a masterpiece and innvovating the zombie genre."
6619,Kingdom,Never seen this korean zombie drama before and it's lit AF
6620,Kingdom,"It's just not re-watchable , hence on my scale it can't go above 3/10 .The production value is decent, but the story is generic and drawn out .Acting is wooden and stereotypical, filming and editing good, visuals repetitive, dialogue and storyline dull .To be fair, it's one of the better zombie series , but then again that's not saying much .For binging with your brain turned off it's perfectly serviceable though ."
6621,Kingdom,"Watched Seasons 1 & 2. Kingdom puts a spin on the usually zombie genre by placing it in the imperial times of Korea. The zombies I can say at least are not just a back drop for another ""period piece kneel before the king drama"".This series actually has a quite a lot of action in it and a plot that is fitting to the theme of the story. In this world the outbreak is caused by a plant instead of the usual virus or people just die and come back to life and we don't know why story.Kingdom tries to fit in a somewhat plausible story and explanation for what's taking place. Some people may not enjoy that as that makes up a good chunk of the series but it is the only thing that sets one zombie movie apart from the other. Establishing how and why people turn into flesh eating zombies does make a difference. The rules for the zombies in Kingdom are different from other zombie shows which does make it interesting.I will note that the series does feel a bit long and talkative at times. There is also a spinoff movie called ""Ashin of the North"". If you haven't seen that movie before watching Season 2 you probably won't understand Season 2's ending very well.I respected the film for what it is which is a unique approach to zombies. It may or may not be for everyone if you don't like period piece movies or fight for the throne stories which also gets tiring since they're 100% of the time always the same storyline (you know someone want's the throne and is scheming to get it, Good king vs Bad king, yadda yadda). This isn't much different in Kingdom but the added use of Zombies makes it interesting.Having watch both seasons and the movie I give this a 6/10. For me the pace was somewhat slower than I liked and there were just characters I found to be quite annoying as well as the solutions to deal with the Zombies.For me this is two series in one. It's an Average period piece ""fight for the throne drama"" but it's also a slightly above average Zombie series too. So you put them both together and it's a solid 6/10 for me."
6622,Kingdom,"I love it! Actually I am still watching first season and till now it continues very well. Great story telling between high and up classes, 1x4 perfect drama (it made me sad) , great zombie action, good acting. Everything is so nice. Very watchable."
6623,Kingdom,... I still watched and enjoyed this series. I found the historical context of sufficient interest to keep me glued.
6624,Kingdom,"The path to finding really great pieces of entertainment can be a strange one.I was once looking round Quora and had my interest piqued by a question about how a modern military would cope against a Zombie horde. The answers were entertaining but in one answer, someone mentioned that if you wanted to see how armies (albeit those from a good few centuries ago) against zombies might look, to check out the South Korean series called Kingdom. So I tracked it down on Netflix, hit play and sat down.Hands down, this is one of the best shows that I have seen on TV for some years. I don't mind watching Korean films and particularly like Brotherhood, War of the Arrows etc and this was on a par with these, if not better.The writing of the characters was really top notch. Their motivations, their power plays, their slow development was a real joy to behold and none more so than the Crown Prince who grew to be an absolute legend. He was likable, relatable and brave and was supported by a host of equally rich and absorbing characters. You felt that you grew with them, you came to understand them and you learnt to predict how they would react because you had grown to admire them.The show had just the right amount of balance between political intrigue, grand master plans and flat out swords and arrows against zombies which was exhilarating. One of the things that I really liked though was how the main characters and even random ones all seem to act sensibly. There were no occasions when you were shouting at the screen to close the door that had swung open or look out for the guy creeping up behind you.Indeed, some of the tactical and strategical planning involved to combat the zombies was breath-taking and insanely clever.So the writing is on point, the costume work is just amazing as the colours and outfits worn are really quite epic and some of the music is just wonderful. There is a death scene in the show which is one of the most poignant and moving that I've seen in a TV show due to the characters, acting, music and visuals.I really can't say enough about this production. Its constant quality equals that of the very best episode of GoT (which would be Hardhome for me) and is up there with the likes of The Expanse, Angel and Firefly as the very cream of TV entertainment.It's probably the best piece of entertainment I've seen in 2020 and whilst eternally grateful to the guy from Quora who suggested it, I cannot recommend this enough. If you are looking for that undiscovered gem of a production that hasn't yet gained mainstream blanket approval then this really is for you."
6625,Kingdom,This show is one of the best zombies tv show I have seen and its gory . The storyline is no nonsense and it goes increasingly intense each episode. It one of the best so grab your buddy who loves zombos and watch this stuff.
6626,Kingdom,A phenomenal south korean zombie series on Netflix. Absolutely wonderful.
6627,Kingdom,A tremendous drama since Season 1 to this Season 2. One of the top 10 drama I had watched in these 2 years. There are some nice exciting parts and storyline is good too. The directorship is topped and nicely done. A must watch for the years.
6628,Kingdom,"I don't watch medieval soaps/dramas nor foreign language films, but this was pleasantly surprising. Cinematic, well choreographed, down-to-earth acting. Binged in about 1-2 days. The decision made at the ending of season 2 seemed a bit contrived, but hey, I don't mind a few artificial plot devices."
6629,Kingdom,"A good zombie apocalypse based in Japan.
The plot is good, acting and special effects on point.However it got increasingly difficult to distinguish the characters as it progress. With the subtitles as our reference and the continuous increase in characters, all wearing similar attire it was difficult to keep up with who was on screen."
6630,Kingdom,"A really good fantasy adventure series with zombies. There is a real hero and nasty villains. Only drawback. The only drawback is the lack of good-looking female characters. Great costumes. The sets could have been spiced up with CGI, though."
6631,Kingdom,"This show is pretty good but I find myself laughing at the voice over actors. They are so over the top they really sound like characters on South Park. Aside from Bae Doona who I believe is doing her own voice over in English many of the characters make me laugh, and I know it's supposed to be serious. The way the zombies portrayed aren't great either. They have all day to kill these things yet they never even make a dent. They're not scary zombies like 28 Days later and there aren't really all out brawls like The Walking Dead. It's mostly just running and funny sounds that make me laugh. It's entertaining though I guess. This review was pretty worthless now that I read it lol."
6632,Kingdom,"The basic fact that I watched through both seasons (12 episodes overall) within just a few days is basically the only thing I really need to say to show how much I enjoyed Kingdom.I like the characters, the setting, the writing as well as the effects and costumes. Putting a zombie plague scenario into a middle age Korean setting is really something new (at least I haven't seen something like this before). I also found the aspects on how the whole topic with the zombies was treated very interesting.At the same time the show is also about the monarchy in Korea around that time and plays quite a bit with the political intrigue aspect. The show has some good twists and turns in season one and two and I hope they continue with the good writing in season three.One little problem I had was telling some of the characters apart. The 6 characters mostly focused on by the story are easy to tell apart (the prince, his personal guard, the queen, her father, the ""sniper"" and the female physician).When it comes down to other characters (ministers and other nobles, soldiers,...) it is much more difficult to keep track on who is who and which side do they belong to. This especially becomes confusing when they suddenly change clothes as for me those are an aspect used to identify the characters (a lot of them have similar facial features and very ""samey"" beards or hair styles in case of the women). I hope they can improve this a bit in the next season. It may give me a reason to watch through the show again at some point."
6633,Kingdom,"I love zombie horror, though I know a lot of people are bored with it. This show however gives us an entirely fresh burst of air on the genre. It takes aspects of Korean culture and mixes them with a story about political scheming, human weakness and of course the ravening hordes. Each part complements the others well as the different aspects blend together to produce an excellent story.Though of course it's violent, there is no gore for the sake of gore and instead of excessive CGI we have talented extras with very good makeup. All in all, it's a great show"
6634,Kingdom,"Excellent! One of the best shows I've seen in terms of acting, setting, story and music. I didn't see the twist coming at the end, it was an awesome way of setting up season 2, which I didn't know was beginning production later this year. I thought it was a one season and done show. But after that ending, I can't wait for season 2! And the queen wasn't pregnant! I was wondering why they were keeping all those pregnant women in a safe house."
6635,Kingdom,They have done a pretty great job creating a show with wights fighting humans with a backdrop of struggle to power. Pretty edgy and doesn't feel cheap at all in their picturization of war with the dead.
6636,Kingdom,"While it is better than 80% of the zombie flicks out there, I feel this series is let down by some horrible over acting. And some ridiculous characters who I assume are there for some sort of comedy value.One minute it's trying to be serious walking dead style horror, the next minute you have bumbling Laurel & Hardy type characters screaming like girls and falling about the place.As for the people giving it a 10 rating...if you consider this a perfect ten, holding it aloft with the Likes of Breaking Bad and the Wire you need your head examined."
6637,Kingdom,"Absolute masterpiece, I was so invested in this world and these characters I loved every minute of it and was so sad when it was over. Can't wait for season 3. Season 2 episode 1 is in the top 5 of my favourite tv episodes of all time it's got truly jaw dropping edge of your seat moments that will stick with you. Everything about this show is perfect you must check it out."
6638,Kingdom,"At first I thought the show will turn into something surprising after the 3rd episode... but not.
Almost every episode is predictable, unscarry and forgettable.
The only thing I can praise are the costumes and scenery.
In conclusion...
Skip it and watch The Haunting of Hill House (2018 -) instead. ;)"

👨‍⚖️ Review : If you love zombies and are on the hunt for something fresh, you cannot go wrong with Kingdom.Kingdom is a Netflix Original South Korean horror series written by Kim Eun-hee. The series is based on the book Land of the Gods, which was also written by Kim Eun-hee. First arriving in 2019, the horror series has since become one of the most popular non-English titles available to stream on Netflix.Beautifully presented and dripping in Asian culture, zombie action-thriller Kingdom is quite the thrill ride. With a exceptional screenplay and beautiful production value this show has all the indegrients for an engrossing binge watch.The zombies are appropriately inexorable, and resemble Train to Busan in terms of falling over themselves while chasing the living. These are not sluggish walkers of The Walking Dead. The visual style is unique, and makeup effects are also good. The gore looks pretty much real, and there is oodles of it here.Season 1:
Split across six hour-long episodes, Kingdom effortlessly blends political drama with a thrilling action plot, full of beautifully shot set pieces. Brutal action sequences, engaging drama and horrifying zombies make this show a must watch. Brilliant Direction and Extraordinary Performances by the Cast makes it extremely worth your time.Season 2:Season 2 raises the bar more and is bigger and better. Proves the mettle of Korean storytelling in this genre.

6640,Kingdom,"It's like House of Cards crossed with The Walking Dead crossed with Shogun, but better.Very enjoyable, good script, good acting, great scenery and an interesting plot while retaining all the tropes of Korean drama.Very much looking forward to the next series, this is a show with a real story arc."
6641,Kingdom,"Review of season 1 - 2
Entertainment value: 9
Visuals: 10
Soundtrack: 6
Plot: 8
World building and depth: 9
Characters and dialog: 8
Total: 8.5The good:
This is just an amazing series, forget all the other zombie series you've seen, this beats them! It is extremely intense from start to finish all the while not sacrificing elegance and style. It is very interesting to watch traditional Korean society, intrigue and it's hierarchy combined with the zombie apocalypse. The second season just reinforces the first into a beautiful masterpiece. The visuals is amazing.The bad:
The soundtrack could be more memorable and the dialog is a bit lacking sometime."
6642,Kingdom,"Despite the simple storyline, the show is well produced, the acting is excellent, it's exciting, the scenes are gorgeous, and it's fascinating.I'm really looking forward to the second season."
6643,Kingdom,"I was really suprised how much I liked ""Kingdom"", even though I normally don't like zombie movies/series.The whole setting of Korea in the 17th century with different regions and Clans/Families striving and fighting for power is really refreshing in contrast to all the movies and series playing in the european middle ages. I really liked that.Despite the fact that normally I really dont't like the whole zombie topic, I really liked how they used the zombies and explained the origins and backgroundstory of the whole problem.The combination of this two ""genres"" is really good and something nice refreshing in the world of series. And if you like zombies more than I do, ""Kingdom"" will probably be even better rated than it is rated by me. Enjoy."
6644,Kingdom,"The human nature conveyed in this series will be more complex and changeable. The plot, suspense, historical elements also make it more colorful.The human nature conveyed in this series will be more complex and changeable. The plot, suspense, historical elements also make it more colorful."
6645,Kingdom,"I just finished binge-watching Kingdom. I'll now explain my headline lol. Here is my review. The story takes place during Korea's medieval Joseon period amongst a mysterious plague. The shows pacing is perfect. The acting is impeccable and all the actors and actresses did incredible. The action was absolutely epic af. No exaggeration. Blood and Gore galore. The battles are the Koreans version of GOT. Korean anything in cinema is my absolute favorite. I feel like they reinvent the wheel constantly for outdoing their previous entries all the time and that ""us"" as American Filmmakers can learn a thing or two from them. The money they invested into this show definitely shows with each episode costing a tad more than 1.78 million dollars. The cinematography is to die for literally lol. The shots in both the action scenes and dramatic yet everyday scenes that were filmed are superb. The tension of the shots is evident at every angle. If you never liked reading subtitles prior you need to fix that crap immediately because this show is so worth it. I hope and pray that they make a season two because as it stands this is my favorite show of 2019 and it's only January and this will undoubtedly remain my new favorite show. Netflix was smart to invest in this show. Horror done right. The zombie design was magnificent in the most grotesque way possible lol. The few plot twists they had in season one were definitely unexpected to say the least."
6646,Kingdom,"I do not understand the many gushing reviews. Yes, the series is visually stunning. Yes, the combination of zombies and medieval Korea is original. But the characters are all very one-dimensional and the scripts are by far the weakest point. Not worth your time."
6647,Kingdom,"Kingdom is a relatively less-spoken-about show (at least in this part of the world) as compared to other Netflix shows that are often blown out of proportion. But this underrated gem is a sheer masterpiece.This is one show that I have been eagerly waiting for a season 2. Season 1 ended on a strong hook-point and season 2 starts exactly from the scene where season 1 ended. Right from the start, you are rest assured that the show is on the right track and not taking any unwanted shortcuts. The storyline is a natural progression on Prince Chang's journey to reclaim his throne while continuing to fight with the plague outbreak.For the uninitiated, this is a zombie thriller and what adds to the impact is the South Korean period setting. Apparently it has one of the most deep-rooted story setups amongst zombie films - a genre which is often relegated for its restrictive or repetitive and gimmicky approach. This is not your typical zombie film with characters running away from the undead in varied settings. The series has an intrinsic story of greed and power (simplest reference: Game of Thrones) with the zombie outbreak working as a perfect backdrop. But when I say backdrop, it does not mean that the execution of the zombie part is any less effective or thrilling. There is enough and more of zombie bloodbath! The treatment is more gory than horror and could be repulsive than scary. But for lovers of the genre, the blood and gore are enjoyable enough.While Season 1 was more about the setup of the outbreak, Season 2 explores the narrative deeper. After its grand entry in the first episode of season 2, the zombies predominantly come only towards the final episodes. But you don't mind that since the makers spend time on good storytelling. And when the zombies arrive in the climax, they come in huge numbers and the action is on grand scale.Season 2 is intrinsically connected with Season 1 with several flashbacks and back stories well explored. Some existing characters get more precedence. The storytelling is very simple yet effective and never gets pretentious or convoluted. The fast pace keeps you hooked to the proceedings.Kingdom is a show where everything from writing, direction, performances, background music, action, period setting and production values is just perfect!Like Season 1, even Season 2 ends on a strong hook-point leaving you hungry for more. However this time the end is somewhat abrupt with the introduction of a random new character who's conflict or future contribution is unclear. One can expect an all new chapter to open in Season 3.Whether you are a fan of zombie genre or Korean cinema or period piece or none of these, you might still enjoy watching Kingdom for its compelling storytelling. Give it a try. If the zombie bug bites you, you will surely come back for more."
6648,Kingdom,"Not just the best Zombie Tv series but the best Tv series ! I was amazed at how good this series is. The acting from all the actors is superb . There are no weak links. They all fit in with each other. No expense has been spared . The sets are fantastic as is the cinematography .The Show has the that atmosphere that it is happening in a different era . It is very hard to create that. There is suspense and thrills throughout , as well as 'ah ha ' moments . It is not predictable at all . The surprises in the show are powerful and have a strong impact , yet they are subtle and sophisticated.I can't wait for Season two. I would highly recommend this Show. It makes TWD look cheap, tacky and amateurish . Who knew South Koreans do it better !"
6649,Kingdom,It is a good show with astonishing visuals.waiting for season 2.
6650,Kingdom,"Netflix Kingdom is like a lot of Netflix shows.
It has huge production value, more so than most of Netflix shows.
The costume design, the practical effects and VFX for the zombies, all the details in Korean culture, the landscapes, the different colors et cetera. They all really feel like the show is taking you into that certain time.The first 6 episodes were also really good in action, when delivering so. Also the last episode had some really slithering tension and really great built up, leading to a cliff hanger. Don't really know what to think of that, but I'll take it for now.But it also falls for the same tropes of many Netflix original shows. First, it has some pacing issues. The 3 & 4th episode in particular feel practically only like retelling the second episode and in all these 3 episode the only thing happening is actually zombies killing people in villages. That leads to a dragging narrative for quite some time.The other flaw I had with it where the lacking characterization of many characters. While it looked gorgeous on the surface, the substance wasn't always there to back up. It certainly touched on themes like royalty, treason & honor, but it never gave its 3-4 characters at center much time to fully come to life.The acting & humor is very Asian-like, so you'd have to be prepared for some of these jokes, as the performances are very much like one would expect from a Korean production. But that's not really a flaw if you have your expectations.If you really don't care about much substance, or explained depth narrative than the show is absolutely perfect. It's zombie action, put into a unique setting, with unique ideas and themes.
I'm probably gonna check the second season out, so I'm curios what they are going to do after that cliffhanger.6-7/10"
6651,Kingdom,"Season 1 was great. Season 2 big let down, too many plot holes, too numerous to list. Last episode of season 2 turned the show into a complete farce."
6652,Kingdom,Brilliant from start to end I am not fan of zombie movies but it was amazing better then walking dead and games of thrones .. waiting for season 3 it will be sure brilliant
6653,Kingdom,When i first read its by Netflix i though Yes !! A good zombie movie! Then i read its Korean and i thought.. uh its gonna suck for sure cause its an asian zombie show but WOW the zombies were amazingly well done!Amazing acting by all the hordes of zombie actors/actresses as well as amazing work by the Makeup Artists. The story is also very entertaining as the actors all draw you in with such cleverly compelling acting + facial expressions to tell the story regardless that its a dubbed audio.If you Liked The Walking Dead?? Then you will loved this series much much more.If you like zombie shows/movies then prepare to be amazed cause this tops my list for all things zombie related.
6654,Kingdom,"The kingdom is gripped with uncertainty, the King is rumoured to be dead, the Crown Prince has been marked a traitor. The King's second wife, the new Queen, is pregnant and is setting up her unborn son to skip the official line of ascension to be King.
In the midst of this Game of Thrones style politicking, there is a strange disease afflicting the land. The dead are not staying dead and at night roam the land hunting the living.
Kingdom is packed with thrills, action, gore, stunning visuals and a well thought out plot. The acting is great and the characters nuanced. It also has been picked up for a second season so there really is no excuse.
Netflix picks another great foreign series to pick up. If you like your zombies with subtitles, if you like your period drama with gore and if you like great television then Kingdom is definitely for you."
6655,Kingdom,"It's hardly a secret that the zombie genre is a dried out well proven by western releases fighting to be the most boring and generic junk out there. Then to my pleasant surprise South Korea dishes up a series set in a Korean dynastic kingdom in 1897 where a crown prince tries to save his land from the horror. And it does it well. Good acting, believable costumes, lovely cinematic and the monsters blends into a wonderful time that makes this series worth your time."
6656,Kingdom,"I have not read the comic source of Kingdom, so I can only judge it based on the Netflix TV series version. For a long time zombie flick fan I must say that this was a surprisingly fresh take on the zombie sub-genre set in medieval Korea. I would imagine that people living in that era would have been stronger, more savage and handy with weapons, thus they would fare better in a zombie apocalypse than their 21st-century counterparts. Alas, many of the characters especially the would-be victims act and think like modern people. They bicker and stay frozen in times of dire situation. There are a lot of posturing, waiting and being shocked by the horror that surrounds them. The series would be scarier if these characters would display their savage nature and still horribly die in the face of unstoppable zombie horde.This leads me to my second biggest criticism of the show: the extras should have spent more time in zombie-acting school so they could move, run and behave like a zombies. Instead most of the time these Korean zombies were running like a mob of hobos. The outbreaks of zombie epidemic becomes more like a mad dash of rioters during a clothing sale at the local mall.Other than those main complaints I thought the first season was fun, fresh and an interesting take on a zombie sub-genre. And the production value was really high and sometimes it feels like promotional videos for Korea tourism.I'm certainly looking forward for the second season, and hoping they will improve the intensity of the show so it's closer to what I had experienced with Train to Busan. I'm also a little disappointed that the end of the first season reveals the nature of the infected horde, which made them more like the Wights from Game of Thrones."
6657,Kingdom,"Horror, to me, has always been a dicey genre. The last horror genre film i completely enjoyed was Gong Yoo's critically acclaimed film 'Train To Busan'. However, when i started watching Netflix's first Korean Original web cum television series- Kingdom, i was completely taken away by the way mastermind scriptwriter Kim Eun Hee (of Signal fame) has intricately woven the plot. Set in between the 15th and 16th century Joseon Era, Kingdom portrays how easily the foundation of a huge empire can crumble down and create havoc amongst the people, in the wake of a terrifying plague gripping the country. What makes Kingdom shine brilliantly is its ability to keep the viewers hooked till the end, of not only one but two whole seasons. Each episode has been beautifully crafted and planned, taking us deeper and deeper into the sinister world of the Royal Family, the horrifying secrets unfolding one after another, as lead actor and protagonist of the series, Crown Prince Lee Chang ( Ju Ji Hoon stands out in a never before seen manner) strives to find out what happened to his father.
Credit has to be given to the mesmerizing cinematography which has enchanted us via the magnificent and breathtaking sets. The way each shot lingers on a scene, giving time to the viewers to appreciate the exquisite landscapes of the countryside, villages, cities, royal palaces, is absolutely gratifying to a whole new level.
Get ready to be pushed to the edge of your seats, as you hold your breath in anticipation every time the zombies come snarling and hissing, ready to lunge at any visible targets. I assure you, even if are not a fan of thriller-cum-horror series, do give KINGDOM a watch. You will feel yourself falling for its ingenious plot, filled with surprises and twists so sharp that can make you go reeling, as you keep on pressing the 'Next Episode Button' and hope that your favourite characters survive the dangerous circumstances coming ahead of them.
I absolutely enjoyed 'Kingdom' and really urge you to watch it, not only because of the power packed acting, but also the way a kingdom affected by an unfortunate crisis, fights back and tries to reconstruct itself.
Please do not miss this one!"
6658,Kingdom,"Its a world best horror darma web series, its give all edge of sit experience, with a new concept this series not give u chances even bink your eyes,
I definitely suggest you to watch it, its is historical zombie horror series."
6659,Kingdom,"#Kingdom
Rating - 8.5/10
Review :
This show contains elements of horror, action, thriller and even mystery.
Season 1 was thrilling and exciting with many twist and turn.
Season 2 gives a deep meaning of being selfless for the sake of others, sacrificing and above all protecting your country.
Don't give it another thought just watch it straight away you will never regret.
#NETFLIX"
6660,Kingdom,"Zombies yes, stunning scenery and superb acting/story line which in itself is something that isn't often not what you associate with a film about the undead.
Interesting little twist to add to the zombie knowledge.
The buildings are just great along with the costumes.
My only disappointment and its the only one is that there are no chainsaws, this may be remedied in the second series, who know!!!!!!!"
6661,Kingdom,From the start this is an excellent production. The set is beautiful historic. Period clothing very nicely done. Acting is great. Writing fantastic. I haven't seen a zombie theme in a looooooong time that I can say anything great about much less remember. This one is a breath of fresh air.Very well done. Worth a binge.
6662,Kingdom,"This is the a very stylish action and horror show. The scenic sets, production and photography is absolutely stunning. It is a visual feast to enjoy. The storyline is quite simple. People are being attacked by zombies that are infested by some kind of disease. And they attack people to spread the desease. And people are trying to flee or fight this zombie epidemic that threathens their lives and civilization. This may sound stupid, but it is highly entertaining in its simplicity. It is hard to be really scared, but it is intensely action packed with fantastic photography. It is like mixing a Samuraij movie of Kurosawa with a modern action and horror flick. All presented in a fantastic package. Get some popcorn and be ready for some intense enjoying action!"
6663,Kingdom,"Horrific, creepy and darkly comical. Loved the scenes where the two prisoners in neck stocks attached to each other, one becomes a zombie, chasing the guy he's attached to, the other guy running, but they are attached and cannot touch. Mother attacking her child, children attacking adults, zombie wearing comic play happy mask. Also, the Mayor hitting on the nurse and she starts to diagnose him with gonorrhea. Suspenseful, nice comic relief. Fast running zombies. Well done (the entire series, some of the zombies)."
6664,Kingdom,"Kingdom will be the best of its genre once you start waching it.
Im an indian, and in my mother language is Tamil, we have n number of kings novels from our language ancient authors but not many of them were filmed as movies. So we were enjoying Game of thrones and Bhagubali only. But now the history expands it self with KINGDOM.Despite of its similar path on the story base as other king stories In my adulthood, this is the solid king story that made a huge impact on me, a perfect writing that has flawless storytelling and the best versions of the actor's characters.
Every episode encouraged my way of watching with the uniqueness that period films only gives.This piece of art will be cherished in the future worldwide, i WISH."
6665,Kingdom,"The story is your typical king/prince betrayal with a zombie twist BUT the characters are boring and not very likable. Frankly it hard to care what happens to anyone in this movie. Hell the only character I had any care for was the traitorous Queen and that only because I wanted to see her get eating alive which doesn't even happen........The acting was okay but the script was pretty poor.The sure as hell is no where near as good as The Walking Dead or Fear the Walking Dead.....Was looking forward to a zombie flick in such an era but damn this is bad..look elsewhere cause this is pure garbage.Dang so many shills giving this over 5 star rating....if you want a good story line, good acting and great fighting scenes watch Into the Badlands instead!"
6666,Kingdom,"I normally dont care much for subtitled shows, but this one surprised me.
It was really well done, and aside from the occasional subtitle that wasnt displayed for long enough, thoroughly enjoyed it.
Cant wait for the next season"
6667,Kingdom,"KINGDOM was brilliant and in my humble opinion, vastly superior to many of the other zombie series out there today. It's certainly one of a kind, a new breed. It was only enhanced by the Joseon historical setting and alternative history presented by the directors. It was excellently written, casted, directed and acted. Great production and cinematography. Beautiful settings, lifelike costumes and realistic storylines. Epic battle scenes and zombie costume/cosmetics. Dark, gritty and cutting edge series.I really loved the cast, especially Ju Ji Hoon as Crown Prince, and Bae Doona as the nurse Seo Bi. I also really enjoyed the character of Kim Sang Ho, as the bodyguard Moo Young. His character was extremely likable and I loved the dynamic between he and the Crown Prince. Kim Sungkyu, as Young Shin (the Tiger Hunter) was a very compelling character as well, playing a mysterious warrior with a shadowy past.Ju Ji-hoon is excellent in this series. His portrayal of the tragic Crown Prince character is really note-worthy and he plays the noble hero turned warrior very memorably. It's great to see his character grow and conquer new obstacles, and become a person worthy to inherit the throne.One of my main critiques is this. As a big fan of actress Bae Doona (Stranger), I did feel like her true potential wasn't being utilized in this series, but that seems mostly seems due to the direction and writing of this series, rather than any issue on her part. I truly hope to see her character allowed grow and shine in future installments as she is a wonderful, diverse actress with a lot of acting range.This series brought so much to the zombie table, so to speak. I found the ""truth"" behind the plague to be fascinating and unique. It was a truly intriguing twist. Also, this series does not shy away from highlighting both the good and evils of humanity, offering a glimpse at human nature and morality. It was a truly stunning show. I've now watched the complete Kingdom series and am hoping for further seasons in the future. This was a great new addition to the kdrama thriller and horror genres.This review is for seasons 1 & 2STORY: 10/10
CINEMATOGRAPHY: 10/10
ART/DESIGN/VISUALS: 10/10
MUSIC: 8/10
OVERALL RATING: 9.5/10."
6668,Kingdom,"If you like zombie films or foreign horror then this is likely for you. Its not exactly a korean the walking dead, its horror is more subtle and less visceral but it works when its employed to good effect. The production and scenery is of a high quality. I found the acting to be good and the crown prince central role interesting and well drawn, developing as series progressed.The plot has alot of new things to add to the genre as well as the obvious cultural place and time shift to usual zombie flick. All in all good entertainment if zombies are for you"
6669,Kingdom,"Only to find it is another rubbish walking dead movie so boring even the flies laughed them self to death, just because it is Korean hello netflix flix of with this rubbish."
6670,Kingdom,"One of, if not, the best zombie show ever created."
6671,Kingdom,"When I started watching this series I didn't know a great deal about it. I expected to be a a Korean drama with zombies set in the past and lots of sword fighting. I was not disappointed. It was exactly what I expected and a little bit more.First of all, I like the mythology of zombies in this series as they remind me of the traditional image (not the Hollywood version) of another monster whose name starts with v.Then after the first zombies appear, the court intrigues peaked my interest more so than the walking dead. Which mean there are more layers to the story and the suspense comes not only from the survival point of view but also form the character motivations. Another good point is that every episode is edited to perfection, there is no dragging along, no fluff to fill the time. The series is focusing on telling a story.Visually, it's top-notch, beautiful scenery and terrifying zombies. I'm hesitant to say it's historically accurate (well, because of the zombies) but I shook my head when I heard people want a strong female character in a period drama, just for the sake of modern trends. The old Korean society had strict hierarchy and the role of women was strictly domestic. Let's not start a dispute about depiction of history.I have 2 negative opinions about the first season of the series (as of writing the only one). First, the way it ended. Huge cliffhanger. Not a big complaint as the second season will come out this year, too. Second, another part of the ending. It wants to be a twist but it's unrealistic. I know I'm talking about realism in a zombie movie again but everything up to the last episode was perfect. Perfect explanation for everything and no obvious plot holes. It's bugging me that two consecutive nights are so different from one another.If you want to enjoy it, just watch it and be surprised at the plot twist, don't try to use physics to verify the possibility of some stuff. It's an amazing series. Way better than Walking Dead."
6672,Kingdom,"I Can't believe I never heard of it and found this series by just searching ""similar"" Train To Busan options to watch on Netflix, I looks they haven't spent too much money on marketing but using it all in the series.
If you are fan of zombie movies we are talking about here in having excellent production, acting, excellent drama and plot (very original), the landscapes are great, soundtracks (terrific). The minutes for each episode are good too (not to large or short, just perfect timing), no unnecessaries and borings refillings episodes like TWD, it gets better and better after each episode. I don't have any cons about this series, the only issue (just because of my fault) is that sometimes I couldn't recognise some of the main characters (an asian with beard and hat looks all the same to me), so I was a kind of lost sometimes but it was not the end of the world. You can feel there is a high professionalism behind this series, **wake-up call to TWD**. Can't wait for season 3, I hope they don't screw it up. :)"
6673,Kingdom,"How could the producer only create 6 episodes for 1 season?This is one of the best zombie film in the world! Although in Korean, the series deserve to supersede any Hollywood zombie series. There's no cliche or cheesy moments. Everyone is there as they should be. Not every one has strong character, but the protagonist and antagonist surely fits the profile."
6674,Kingdom,"If you are a fan of zombies, this is a MUST! I can't remember last time I felt panic and fear while watching zombie film/show. Holy smokes!
I'm hoping tonight I continue this nightmare in my dreams... xD After 5 episodes in a row, I think I will prob have nightmares."
6675,Kingdom,"These two seasons serials very interesting, because for me it's my first time to watch zombie with korean kingdom's background. Good plot and thrilling horror actions. Great performances from the actors and actresses. I'll wait for the third season."
6676,Kingdom,"I mean, it basically has everything for me - a fight for the throne, beautiful settings and outfits, interesting characters, and zombies. There aren't many great zombie series out there, and Kingdom is definitely one of them. There's really little wrong with it if you're looking for an entertaining zombie series with a compelling plot. It might not be for those who are tired of the zombie tropes, but I have yet to reach that point. Can't wait for Season 2."
6677,Kingdom,"A medievel age zombie apocalypse concept itself is enough for this successful series,great acting by the lead cast....typical political thriller carried neatly with parallel zombie plot makes more impressive...Slow pace at some episodes demands necessity to build the plot...Overall another entertaining and breathtaking series which does make Hollywood biggies envy..."
6678,Kingdom,"Stellar Cast. Great Acting. Awesome Actions. Good Pace. Magnificent Story Line. Wonderful Production. Altogether, one of the best kdramas ever made.Everything about this drama is top notch! One should not miss this."
6679,Kingdom,"I'm an adult and zombies scare the bejeepers out of me, but this looked really artful and interesting so I gave it a try. After a couple of episodes I was no longer afraid and really engrossed by the story. This is, no joke, the Asian Game of Thrones, only not as violent and sexually explicit. There was humor, but it was very subtle. The story has gotten quite intense. The characters are keeping me interested. The settings are beautiful and the music is stunning. I'm very much looking forward to more. My husband and I binged the first season in one night."
6680,Kingdom,"I don't like the whole zombie genre, but I really enjoyed ""Kingdom"". The creators took a whole different approach to it and rather than do the whole apocalyptic dystopian future thing, they did it in a historical setting with skilled warriors.Also a small detail, but makes soo much of a difference, is the dubbing. Its done really well and with a more authentic accent as if they are speaking English, unlike alot of dubbed programs where its either/and off sync, or has voices that clearly don't match the actors appearance on screen.Over the recent years, Korea has made some amazing movies and series and this is definitely one of them."
6681,Kingdom,"It's too exciting. The film alleges the past and the present. The monarch is incompetent, the bureaucrat is corrupt, and the people are forced to alienate. It can be said that it has great depth and significance. Unfortunately, there are still some bugs in the plot. For example, all people will not be eaten up by the zombies, but will become new zombies."
6682,Kingdom,"What a great show!!!!! There is not one duel moment in one single episode, I hang on to the edge of my seat the whole freaking time!!!! This is a change of pace from TWD and FTWD, the writers and directors need to take a good look at what these people are doing, and take a page out of their book!!!! I gave up on those other shows, they are to drawn out and boring!!!!!!!"
6683,Kingdom,"First of all, it has already used a huge amount of GOT soundtracks, if you listen closely, you can hear Ramin's Coronation and the White Walkers' theme, which were used not only once, but multiple times.Second, the characters were basically the same. A prince who's promised ended up being in a desolated place, fighting the dead for his people and the kingdom, sounds familiar? It's Jon Snow, but this time he went south, not north. A vicious queen, with her father's help, gained the power of the nation, granted by the marriage with the king himself, sound familiar? Because it's the Lannisters ! The queen is Cersei and her father is Tywin, even their characteristics are basically the same.Third, the dead were afraid of the sun, ok, that's interesting, I thought that at least there're something different, but until the last episode, that twist is the last straw that breaks the camel's back: they weren't afraid of the sunlight, but instead, it's the temperature that scared them. What it's implying is that the dead can move when it's COLD, which month do you think is the coldest? Which season is it? And which season would the White Walkiers invade Westeros? Just think about it, they're almost nothing in this series are original, what's even worse is that there wasn't even that much plots and characters to make this show more interesting than GOT, and what's more is that the plot still follows the basic stereotype of the Korean drama: using the extreme characters to create an extreme situation, there're only bad guys and good guys, and the bad ones are always extremely evil, they're heartless, cruel and selfish, and the good guys are always honest, caring, and upright, the plot in this kind of dram just always have to satirize the government and the class system, which were already satirized in almost every Korean movies and TV shows.I'm sorry but I just can't see why people keep comparing it to The Walking dead, because it's nothing like TWD, I mean NOTHING. It's GOT its copying right now.The settings, the direction, the pacing, the actors and the production were fantastic as always, but the plot is just too familiar to be good."
6684,Kingdom,I don't know how or where this show got all these good reviews. We tried to keep an open mind but by the end of the second episode I felt like I was losing brain cells.
6685,Kingdom,"I think this TV Serie is worth to watch because:
1) good story ... i think you like the storyline and after watching 1 or 2 episodes you countinu to watch
2) short story ... they say what they want to say in only 12 episodes,
3) good acting, Actors preform their roles very good and real"
6686,Kingdom,"Liked the first season and watched the much awaited second. The second season continuous the same tone as left in the first season,makers taken serious effort to make the details perfect . The writing is mature and on point for which the writer is already well known. They left you with an open ending which is okay for me. One of the best zombie shows up there."
6687,Kingdom,"Season season is lil bit upsetting. Main cast was about to take throne from queen. Just said child is not kid from kings blood, but why it has changed and rejected his throne just after battle. That was too dramatic and annoying. That was just the spot to take his throne. And also scenes that zombies bite people like real are too few in whole season 2. Szn 2 is lil bit upset. 8 rating for first szn, 7 for szn 2."
6688,Kingdom,"I found this Korean zombie series better than walking dead. This series is like a Korean version of zombie in game of thrones. The zombie , story everything about this series is fresh. This series even likes to the non zombie lovers.
This series was a big surprise for me . I never expected it would be such good . They exicuted the series a large scale with limited budget. They keep 2 season with 6 episode each so there is not a wastage of single second. The graphics, action sequences, charectors, story were outstanding. I highly recommend to watch it . It would have been a great lose if you miss it."
6689,Kingdom,Worth a watch. Season 2 ending makes little sense though.Would easily be a 9/10 if they had gotten that right.It seems that they threw all logic down the drain towards the end.
6690,Kingdom,Just awesome! Excellent! I can't wait for more! I love this korean series! This is probably more excellent quality than some any hollywood movies!
6691,Kingdom,"There are wonderful reviews about this show so I was very eager to watch it. The first episode was really good. The scenery was beautiful and I loved the intensity and intrigue. I love zombie flicks and then throw in a Korean period piece....what's not to love?!
But by the 3rd episode the tone completely changed and it seemed like the show didn't take itself seriously anymore. I hated the bumbling buffoonery of some of the town leaders. The zombies became like all the B rated horror movies that we laugh at. It was cringe worthy and I couldn't stomach it. Very disappointing.
I might have to give it another try though."
6692,Kingdom,"The quality of each episode is a bit reminiscent of the Peaky Blinders (o.k, or any good series) where each 50 odd minute segment has the presence and pace of a feature length film.
The infected are gifted with the stamina and athletic running abilities introduced to this genre by Boyle's 28 days later. Overall it is very good. The narrative is well woven between the Prince and his trustworthy bodyguard, a royal power struggle, a wandering nomad and an altruistic nurse. Well worth a watch."
6693,Kingdom,"Really interesting combination of ideas. Fun new approach to zombies. I don't mind dubbing. The problem with this show is the characters are written to be pretty idiotic, with a few small exceptions most of the people are unbelievably dumb. Some of the plot points are pretty trite and ridiculous, even for the genre. The style and setting are so different it's interesting but really suffers from some poor dialogue writing. Potential...so much potential."
6694,Kingdom,The story is not new at all but the execution is totally original and pulse pounding. The cast of hundreds must have been a nightmare to direct for all those frenetic chase scenes. Very well acted and directed. Kudos to the South Korean tv and film industry. Reminded me somewhat of the Wailing A horror story with heart and a little humor.
6695,Kingdom,"Kingdom is far different from TWD.
Yes they both have dead people that pose a danger to the living, but the execution , cinematography, and the frenetic pace in kingdom is very different, as are the huge battle scenes.
And please! Those comparisons to GOT are ridiculous."
6696,Kingdom,"This is my first experience of a zombie show, binge watching in two days and I can't agree more with all the hypes! It's just sooo brilliant! I love every single thing about it, amazing casts, superb story plot, impressive zombies, splendid cinematography, literally every single thing. I am so amazed with Ju Ji Hoon here, he perfectly portrays himself into the character. And I also love the queen, her acting is so great till you can feel how cruel she is. Even after finishing the show, I still browse its behind the scenes because it's simply hard for me to move on from such a brilliant show. Trust me, you'll be so amazed and thrilled with the concept, quality and Ju Ji Hoon's charm. I really can't wait for the third season and hope they won't end it sooner *finger crossed*."
6697,Kingdom,"This is my first try of K-drama and I am pretty surprised. I normally don t watch vampire or zombie TV/movie after too many seasons of The Walking Death. But a zombie show set in Joseon period is kind of new and intriguing.The story is strong and intense, never a dull moment. Execution is good and the fighting scenes are remarkably made. Characters are entertaining and deep specially the Crown Prince. The only character I feel can explore more is the female doctor.The lead actor (who plays Lee Chang) is very good and I really like him after this show. Great acting from a lot of supporting cast and overall, a very good entertaining show that is worth the time.The only disappointment I have is the ending (season 2) where the Crown Prince just gave up the throne to a commoner baby, which he knew is the son of his guard, this contradicts the whole story line, the audience are led to believe that blood line is very important in the succession of the throne and that the royal blood should be preserved. I shall look forward to the third season and hopefully Crown Prince will let us know why he did what he did."
6698,Kingdom,So intriguing and clever. Nice to see something that's not the same thing I've and over.
6699,Kingdom,"One of the best shows on Netflix right now. I did not expect the show to be that good. Good scenario, good acting, suspenseful and great cinematography. I want the season 2 now!!!"
6700,Kingdom,"10/10 for costumes and production. Acting is good. Characters are likable. But what bothered me (and I cannot get over it), why didn't they kill those people at the very beginning? They knew going for the head would put an end to those ""monsters"". Why did they try to contain them in the hospital? They are sleeping during the day (hiding in dark places, looking dead and not moving). Just cut off the head of everyone of them and it's done. After they escaped, yes, it was too late. And there were too many other infections. It seems they thought they could cure the ""disease"". Maybe that was the reason. But really? With people looking like this? Just go during the day, cut off as much heads as you can -- and it's done. In almost every other zombie flick those undead are a danger during night AND day which makes it hard to kill them. But those were mere vampires with no powers during the day."
6701,Kingdom,"The series has a complex story-line which makes you want to watch continuously. Everything is spectacular from costumes, cinematography and settings....It has everything from the drama of Game of Thrones and the horror, action and suspense of The Walking Dead and Contagion-Zombie shows.....would love to have more 6-Episode Seasons .."
6702,Kingdom,"The kingdom is one of the best shows made in recent times. It is very well-paced and keeps you invested in the storyline.The fight for the throne and a zombie attack it kind of feels like what Game of Thrones tried to do with a similar situation where they had white walkers but unlike the game of thrones where they built up the white walkers thing for so long and we never got a pay-off here, we get to see them battle the zombies.Even the fight for the throne is an interesting storyline. We as the viewers are shown how the lives of the people are affected when someone vicious is on the throne and that's why it feels necessary to get someone new on the throne.The show keeps you on the end of your seat most of the times and wondering what is going to happen next. The action sequences are handled well throughout the show.Hope you give this show a try as it's really good and probably better than anything that Hollywood is offering as of now."
6703,Kingdom,"I first watched this in Korea, without dubbing or subtitles. Even without being able to understand anything they were saying, the acting and imagery was addicting. Now back in the states I re-watched it, dubbed and fell in love with it all over again. you don't want to miss season 2's ending, really hoping a third is coming too. Maybe by then I'll know enough Korean to understand it all."
6704,Kingdom,"The Busan tour in the costume palace version is too exciting! Complete 6 episodes in one go. The thrilling atmosphere is created just right, the editing and photography are all film-level, and it is worthy of being produced by Netflix. Like Pei Douna, looking forward to Quan Zhixian in the third season. Always laugh when the zombies ran out of their lives, they all ran too fast and too fiercely! It's really hard for this crowd of actors"
6705,Kingdom,"Zombies in middle Joseon-era Korea? Hell yeah! We've got sword play and Korean kick-ass martial arts to satisfy action junkies and zombie gore to satisfy zombie junkies, all in one series. Firearms are not the primary weapon but swords and human ingenuity are, which present a real sense of struggle in the middle-ages. The zombies are living human-fast but not cheetah-fast (e.g., World War Z), are afraid of water, and are cognizant of day/night. Or is it temperature? Ha Ha Ha see the latter to find out. Having zombies that run as fast as the living makes sense - they can catch up and quickly dispatch you. With slow walking zombies (i.e., Walking Dead, FTWD), it is hardly believable that with a minor trip or wrong turn, they've already grasped you tight enough to mark your doom. The zombie characteristics in Kingdom make this show very disruptive to the zombie genre, much for the better because they bring new ideas to a genre that has shown story-line fatigue through its enduring front-runners (i.e., calling out TWD). The characters are relate-able and the acting is high quality. There is some comic relief as well. I do not mind reading subtitles because I'm used to watching international shows and movies - and you can also learn from them. A terrific show - Netflix DO NOT CANCEL IT!!!!!!"
6706,Kingdom,"This drama makes very effective use of suspense and these zombies are not at all sluggish, slow-moving, or entirely brainless. The biological explanations for dead humans running and trying to eat living humans seems pretty plausible. The only thing lacking is intimacy in the series--you don't really get to know any of the characters intimately, there isn't much character development, and relationships don't really evovle and develop. But in terms of a plot-driven storyline this drama does a great job. Sometimes the shock effects seem gratuitious and uncessary especially after the viewer is introduced to the zombies and have a good idea of how they operate. Scenes where a character is being stalked and pounced by these zombies during the last few episodes seem a little pointless. Suspense is really only exiciting when the predator is unknown and not well-understood. Otherwise, we can pretty much predict what the monster will do."
6707,Kingdom,"If it wasn't for a GQ article about this show, I would have kept passing it by, as I have been for the last month. Just finished the second episode and I know the rest of my Saturday will be shot.The production quality is amazing, the pacing is perfect and the story compelling. Haven't even finished the season and already psyched there will be another one!"
6708,Kingdom,I am amazed by the storyline. It's very well written. Just perfect. I didn't expected it would be this great.Loved it.
6709,Kingdom,"The acting is great, the cinematography is incredible, the production value is outstanding, and yet we are left with a plot that is pretty simple and predictable for the most part. I enjoyed this, don't get me wrong, but I was really expecting there to be higher stakes and significantly more tensions throughout. For a horror series, it was only until the final episode that I ever even got a good jump scare. I respect the use of actual extras to perform as the zombies, but holy crap--some of these extras are so silly in their body language/performance/movement that there is no hiding their human-ness regardless of how much makeup you put on them. Characters are very simply defined without much moral ambiguity, increasing the simplicity of the story.Will watch season 2, but this series is not yet ground-breaking beyond it's production value."
6710,Kingdom,A bit slow in the beginning but then it takes off. I'm not a zombie movie fan but I Loved it.
6711,Kingdom,"I was waiting for this!Perfect show. The acting is very good, the story is amazing!"
6712,Kingdom,"Always been a fan of zombie films and tv series and this was something else. Rinsed it in a day as it's only 6 episodes which I needed more.Quality of the production and locations was stunning and really made it feel there no where to hide. As I had to places English audio to watch it, at first it was a bit hard but it got quick and enjoyable fast. The style of zombie was really fresh and how they contract the disease was new. The era it was placed in was much better than all modern apocalyptic styles. Samurais and zombies was a good concept. Day they are fine to night was exceptional!The ending with the big defensive push was calm and building the tension reall well till the final moment!6 episodes seemed way too short and it might be another year till I see it again."
6713,Kingdom,"Im totally overwhelmed by this exceptionally good korean tv show. Looking so forward for season 3. Script, acting, fight scenes, special effects/ make up, music score, cinematography, set design, editing... etc.. there is nothing to be faulted! I give it a 9.5/10 simply top tv show"
6714,Kingdom,"Only through the first season but there is more to this korean series than zombies. Well produced, acted and soundtracked. The story behind their existence unravel as episodes go by. These are not your regular walking dead that limp or drag. You've got to outrun these monsters!
I'm really enjoying Kingdom."
6715,Kingdom,"I thought the zombie genre was far too saturated and nothing new could be done anymore, but this show proves me wrong.This show takes place during medieval time in Korea, and it combines two seemingly very different genres of period political thriller and zombies. This weird combination turns out to be a brilliant solution for some persisting problems with modern zombie films.First is by having characters using medieval weapons, fights with zombies are now so much more thrilling. You can truly feel the danger the characters are in. More importantly, mixing the zombie survival scenes with scenes of political plotting makes for a very interesting and refreshing experience. There will always be something new to keep you on the edge of your seat instead of the tired repetitive jump scares like in other zombie shows.And of course when it comes to Asian horror, you can always expect all out gore fests. There will be no sloppy cuts, just one epic action shot after another. Hollywood definitely can learn a thing or two from these filmmakers.My only complain for the first season is the disservice the script does to the female lead character as she keeps having to deal with silly B plots and playing second fiddle to the male characters.Overall though this is absolutely horror done right, and I'm looking forward to the new season!"
6716,Kingdom,"This show is exactly what one can expect when Koreans adapt the zombie genre for the screen and more. At the end of this review I will tell who should see this and who should stay away.First let's talk about the visuals. They are beautiful, haunting and bring a great mix of epicness and two person scenes. This looks like someone didn't need to think about costs and hence they overspent heavily. These large scale encounters help to immerse into the medieval Korean world.I personally find the acting and mannerism of east asian actors a bit too suited for actual theater and it was at times difficult to discern who is who just from the many scenes that don't need a lot of dialogue and the vast number of actors. But the characters, good and bad are more or less fleshed out, albeit much less than in the ""Walking Dead""Unlike ""Game of Thrones"", this show does absolutely not feel multicultural. Instead we are shown an intriguing world with a lot cultural background. While the world building is great, the plot is fast and takes a lot of twists and turns in just two seasons. In comparison to the typical hollywood TV-show, the deroulement of the story is fast paced and feels almost crammed. The plot almost never needs to resolve itself by tapping into magic or a deus ex machina situation. Also, some care is given about social differences, justice and responsibility.There is gore and violence but no sex. The thrill is helped by excellent camera work and intense lighting and sceneries. This is all cinema level action perfection.The music, I can't talk too much about it, but it serves its purpose. The intro is great and after a bit of time you'll understand it.When can you see this and when should you stay away? Being a zombie movie genre fan is a prerequisite. Being interested into an all Korean cast in and a medieval East Asian setting is equally a prerequisite. Violence and gore is displayed so don't forget about the PG rating. This is cool and a totally different approach to the zombie genre, give it a try. The intense plot and suspense will make you binge watch this fast."
6717,Kingdom,It reminds me of watching historical korean dramas with my parents as a child and then BAM here come some zombies...
6718,Kingdom,"This is literally exact replica of the movie rampant which came out the year prior, also on netflix. Started watching this right after watching rampant. Doesnt seem to bad of a show though not sure if netflix just stole the idea or not"
6719,Kingdom,"Rating movies and series is different as the very thing is different from each other. When i rate series, i always think about my experience while watching. In this particular series, there was no unnecessary stretching, no fillers wasting time. Characters are on spot and one can feel for everyone. Relationship between them can be felt in a way that you predict what they're going to do next. ( little spoiler: during the interaction between the chief counselor and the Queen also happen to be father and daughter, i felt that the father was exploiting his daughter too much and she is going to protest back heavily. That what really happened) . This kind of relating to characters by audience can be done by a brilliant set of writers.Now the main thing, I have never seen zombies in pre-modern civilization. Zombie slaying by swords and arrows with fancy dress and hats?? I am up."
6720,Kingdom,"""Kingdom"" is ""The Walking Dead"" on steroids.
These zombies don't amble along like your granny with a bad hip. They flat out sprint. And their behavior is part undead, part Regan McNeil a la ""The Exorcist""-- foaming, contorting, and screaming.
For a genre that wore out its welcome years ago, ""Kingdom"" puts a surprisingly fresh spin on the zombie chase.
The setting is charming-- a China when Emperors ruled.
It is hard to find a connection with the characters, due mostly to corny subtitle translation. But I did find myself rooting for several characters.
Here's hoping ""Kingdom"" finds an audience.
For those of us who prayed for Carl's death, and have grown weary of Rick and the tedium of ""The Walking Dead"", this is one tense and at times terrifying alternative."
6721,Kingdom,"I had high hopes for this drama. Previous Netflix backed high-budget Korean drama (Mr. Sunshine) was very impressive. So, Netflix plus a team of writer, director, and actors with solid body of work should have amounted to a very interesting show. Unfortunately, the show falls way short of any reasonable expectations. Some of the zombie attack scenes were too drawn out, lasting over 10 minutes. The writer attempted to sprinkle in some elements of humor, which fell flat most of the times or felt extremely awkward. The audience, myself included, is willing to accept the premise of zombies in Korea in the 17th or 18th century. However, that does not mean the same audience is willing to accept illogical behaviors of characters and ludicrous fight scenes just so that the writer can steer the story to where ever it is headed. It was just a forced effort to mix two popular genres with no compelling story line."
6722,Kingdom,"Words cannot express how amazing this show is. Direction, visuals, story, acting, action, dialogue, makeup and special effects. All knock it out of the park.
Every episode drew me in and kept my intense attention, making me even shout at the television in pure fear for the characters.
Amazingly made and was such a refreshing take to the zombie genre, especially after the Walking Dead became rather mundane and dull.
Everyone needs to watch this show."
6723,Kingdom,"So, like the middle of the second season. I put a thumbs down oblivious without patience what was coming next. But as before, I remain my case that the story telling is amazing until the kid who wasn't blood related to the throne was saved by the gracious King. However the nurse-Doc surge the baby in the water letting the worms out, but towards the end he was still infected???? That story made no sense at all and doesn't add up. Instead of a 10 giving it an 8/10. Hoping the next season explains the occurrence that happened towards the endsof the kid's journey."
6724,Kingdom,They've gotten really good at making it looks like people are being chopped into bits for real
6725,Kingdom,"Period drama, zombie show and tense atmosphere- this show has everything to keep you attached to your seat till the very end of the season. For the actors' strong acting, gripping action and gruesome visuals, and an overall powerful narrative, it is a must watch for horror fans."
6726,Kingdom,"I just want to emphasize that this series is through and through decent. I didn't want to have any issues or questions with it due to the engaging story, cutting edge cinematography, incredible actors and genuine horror.So we are led to accept that the two at the medical compound spent around 3-5 days securing the compound, adding spikes around the parameter and inside, fed and watered themselves... And didn't once think to stab the zombies while they slept? Considering one of them is an elite warrior who has no issue in slaughtering the zombies in the hundreds later on, I would have thought his first reaction would be to just off them.While on the subject of the Hunter warrior fellow, why did he feed the people a corpse which was at least a week old? Why not actually go out do what he said and go hunt a deer? If they don't answer that question in season 2 then it devalues the entire show because if it turns out that he's all for the disease to avenge his family then suddenly it all fits and I'll forgive my last two points. But if they leave it unanswered then we will have to just ignore such a stringent point.The bad guys are 2D and do nothing but add filler to an otherwise brilliant series. The long drawn out sequences where the baddies prattle on about how evil they are and how ingenious their plans are just make the eyes roll.My biggest question is what was with the ending? My theory is that they ran out of money. If you think about it the tension of the series was building towards this ending, the story at the pace it was heading needed at least 10 episodes not 6, and the zombies up until that point had religiously gone to sleep at sunrise and woken up as soon as the sun set which doesn't allow enough time for the temperature to change, the zombies also don't react to warmer environments such as a room with a fireplace , being wet ( they'd stay colder for longer) and cold misty days as shown in episode 4.So the fact that they dropped in this long drawn out, filler filled last episode which contained nothing but building montages which seemed to be made partially of shop floor footage, conversations which I feel would normally have been cut or spread out over a few episodes and a plot twist so unusual it doesn't make much sense- leads me to believe that they simply ran out of money, time or ideas. Netflix could have turned the money tap off and told them to get it wrapped up pronto for the start of 2019. If we go with this theory then the ending does kind of make sense.Despite all this I would highly recommend this series to everyone. And I just hope Netflix does allow them to finish season 2 without it too being cut short"
6727,Kingdom,We need MORE. Counting down the days to hear when season 3 will release.
6728,Kingdom,"I really liked this series. First of all the zombies are not the usual slow-motion lame creatures, they are very quick. Secondly the story adds up like a puzzle and every episode provides some more pieces to the whole picture. The favorite thing for me was that the biggest villain was hidden and appeared only at the end.
I read that it was censured and it was not allowed to have too gory scenes. Well, I don't know which scenes were left out because it had quite a lot spectacular killing moments.
I hope it will be continued soon."
6729,Kingdom,"Just when you think you've seen every possible zombie scenario...Bam! Netflix puts every on notice (Hollywood studios and other streaming services) that they are way ahead of the game! This is possibly the best zombie series or film ever. I know, ""what about TWD""? Well this series answers, ""what about it"". I loved TWD and respect what it did for prime time television, but ""The Kingdom"" is why you pay for Netflix. It is absolutely incredible, mixing gorgeous cinematography, action, political intrigue, feudal Japan (even though it's Korean made) and zombies! Netflix just keeps pushing the envelope and no matter how many mediocre originals they put out they get some right and big studios will slowly fade away (sadly) because when Netflix gets it right they really get it right! This series, that starts off with 6 episodes has another 6 waiting to be released is worth the 14 bucks a month. It's an easy binge and worthy of our time. 10 out of 10!"
6730,Kingdom,"I am very stuck as to whether I want to give this an 8 or 9. In terms of pure enjoyment this thing is easily a 10, I started it one evening then ended up finishing it the next evening because it was just so goddamn engaging. The music is incredible, the costume design is incredible, the cinematography is incredible, the action is exciting, the story is gripping. There's the odd goof and 'why did they put that in?' moment that keeps it from being perfect but I would still give it an easy 9.So what is this massive flaw that makes my 9 so shaky?Time skipping.This show has a bad habit of changing the lighting drastically within short spaces of time. It doesn't make an attempt to make us believe that the characters have been staying in that one place for hours, they have no reason to, they just fast forward the day cycles. This is less of a problem in season 2 thanks to a revelation about the infected at the end of season 1 but still happens at least once.However, if you are ready to deal with this issue and are also up for a LOT of violence (I think this show is more violent than Game of Thrones all things considered), this is an absolutely exhilarating ride."
6731,Kingdom,Zombies and people with silly hats. A perfect combination. The walking dead is boring watch this instead
6732,Kingdom,"This series manages to mix genres and do it very well. The story develops and the focus changes in a fluid manner that makes sense as it happens. Bae Doona, who was so good in Stranger, has a strong supporting role in this series and the rest of the protagonists are good as well. But the stand out performance is Queen Cho, played by Hye-jun Kim. She is one evil character that you will hate by the end."
6733,Kingdom,Best of suspence if you love zombie series or movie you will love it must watch this series.story is good
6734,Kingdom,"Great show from the land of fantastic drama that is South Korea. Some very interesting new ideas on the Z genre, good pacing, nice cinematography, atmospheric soundtrack and a few twists. Was going to give the show the highest rating of 10 but then got frustrated by some of the decisions and behaviour of one of the main character."
6735,Kingdom,"Sumptuous, sweeping period drama that captures the horror of a dread disease sweeping across the landscape. Great cast with a chilling ambience keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat from the first moment to the last."
6736,Kingdom,"Can't ask for more and shouldn't settle for less. If you haven't watched this yet, and you're into great, history-tinged storytelling that's also fun, flawless acting and a bit of unmatched Korean zombie-action, than you're in for a treat. In fact, I wish I was you."
6737,Kingdom,The show is in Japanese I believe with not so great subtitles. But the English voice over helps. This show is actually really good and the storyline is interesting. The virus and apocalyptic storyline makes sense and it keeps you hooked. This show is worth the watch.
6738,Kingdom,"Loved this series, most episodes finished on a cliffhanger.The acting is good as is the special effects.The story is good with great twists, perhaps the game of thrones Writers should have got these guys to write the last season that would have been a major improvement.Season 2 ends on a further cliffhanger, roll on season 3. I hope Netflix signs on the dotted line."
6739,Kingdom,I'm a great lover of k drama and horror films and the Koreans do it so well I've just binged watched all six episodes in one sitting ( it's now three in the morning ) as I couldn't stop watching yes the acting was a bit ott in the beginning it didn't matter and I didn't see the twist coming in the last episode can't wait for season two hear it's got the go ahead if you love zombies and k drama don't miss this
6740,Kingdom,"I would not have recommended this series to myself if I could, as it lacks the (intellectual) depth and inspiration that I seek in fiction. I would say it is worth the watch if the setting and the themes speak to you and if 'thrilling entertainment' is enough for you. 'Spoiler' for the themes: these include political conflict in a historic setting and a zombie epidemic.I felt like from some point the series stretches out the story just to stretch out and lacks the willingness to end the story.
It does achieve a lot in a short period of time and is fast paced. It is good at creating exciting action scenes. This series will definitely give you a lot of adrenaline and regularly leave you in awe for the ambitious scenes in the series.
You do get sucked into the story and world. Especially season one is good at building up a narrative. Season two has more episodes that left me kind of unsatisfied, as the political drama could get somewhat tedious for me. Season two seemed to spend too much time trying to move the plot along or resolving conflicts, and spend too less time on the characters and their motivations (lacking the focus of season one). Season two is still good quality, just somewhat less than season 1."
6741,Kingdom,Better than your average Zombie movie sub-titles mean you have to really watch to keep up with an interesting plot line. With good acting and some humour
6742,Kingdom,"Drama and plot 5/5
horror 4.5/5
Humour 3/5
Action 3/5
cgi 2.5/5
very much engaging"
6743,Kingdom,"The strongest part of this series is the story and its not just another mindless zombie series. if you start watching s01, give it a go for first two episodes and it grows heavily on you. season 2 was absolutely full on class. awaiting season 03. awesome.."
6744,Kingdom,"This is the zombie apocalyptic theme serial have to be made.
Kingdom = straight to them point, not too much drama, action and push your heart beats fast"
6745,Kingdom,Pure genius. It seems like South Korea is the hub for truly amazing entertainment right now. Kingdom and Sweet Home set the bar for this genre. Kudos to Netflix for bringing this masterpiece to their platform!!!
6746,Kingdom,"What do you get when you throw together Zombies, a Korean dynastic kingdom, political betrayals, a nurse and a tiger hunter for good measure. You get a brilliantly original series that's what. Kingdom is a massive breath of fresh air into the somewhat saturated zombie genre.It's not quite as complex as other shows, but it's brilliant fun and has more than enough depth to keep you on the edge of your seat. The scenery is fantastic, really adding to the scale of the show. There are genuine moments of horror, loads intense action and plenty of humour too. Above all else it's a really exciting show that is well worth a watch. Good job Netflix, looking forward to season 3!"
6747,Kingdom,"This show is set set in medieval Korea and follows the story of Crown Prince Yi-Chang who becomes embroiled in a political conspiracy and is forced to embark upon a mission to investigate the spread of a mysterious undead plague that has begun to spread.
The story starts with claims that the king of Joseon is dead and the crown prince should be crowned immediately however no one was allowed to visit the king not even the crown prince himself later at night the crown prince sneaked into the palace to visit his father wanting to know the truth But is caught by the palace guards and decides to seek out the retired royal physician Accompanied by his personal guard Moo-Young Prince Yi-Chang must prevent the advance of the plague towards his home capital of Hanyang while surviving the sinister coup against him aimed towards his removal as the heir to the throne.The show has been dubbed into English but i watched it in Korean the original language the English dub sucks anyways. This show is really good the acting is great and the characters and costumes believable also quite impressive world and set design looks appropriately medieval it has good cinematography with quite a few interesting shots it has very little music mostly background tracks to accompany action scenes some scenes in this show have a huge amount of extras on screen at the same time impressive.This show is great good story great acting Definitely looking forward to season 2. :D 8.5 / 10"
6748,Kingdom,"Very good, this series is really amazing! It tells of a zombie plague in the Joseon era, the whole story is mixed with Horror, Action, Scary, Drama, Politics and History. Anyway, have to watch!"
6749,Kingdom,I have to say that this is absolutely brilliant and superb.As it is in Korean you cannot take your eyes off it in case you miss any subtitles - but you would not want to miss anything anyway.Beautiful cinematography and wonderful costumes.If I could give it 11 I would
6750,Kingdom,This is the best Korean series on Netflix by far. It kept me on the edge of my seat in each episode. The zombies in this series is much different from what you see in Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead so it feels fresh. The political struggle and the fight against zombies makes it absolutely intense. Some of the scenes were riveting. I can't wait for season 2.
6751,Kingdom,"This is my first time watching with subtitles,and I'm glad i gave it a go. Finally netflix has given something good to watch. It keeps you wanting for more. Story is engaging. The thing it lack is connection with the characters, you don't feel much connected but hey you are being entertained and thrilled what else do you need."
6752,Kingdom,Very slow best scenario with mediocre acting. Beautiful visuals and sceneries. Very good costumes also. But the scenario is slow and boring. You can predict easily the next move.
6753,Kingdom,"A very good production but with crucial errors!! The scenario is painfully slowly, with many holes. The acting is mediocre with a theatrical style. Many times you thinking that you watching, Chinese theater!! the way the actors and cabras play is reminiscent of 80s Asian films. For a western viewer, this is almost ridiculous. the costumes are very well made but cannot save the end result!"
6754,Kingdom,"This is hands down one of the best zombie series/movies. Everything from the acting, to the story to direction and picturization is perfect. Each character grows with the story.It has the right blend of zombie, greed, politics and suspense to keep you guessing.Can't wait for the 2nd season."
6755,Kingdom,"By year 2020 if you havnt seen at least 10 zombie movies you either live in bfe Zanzibar or you dont own a tv. There have been more zombie movies and tv shows then probably any other movie theme. zombies have become an entire genera unto themselves and theres really only so much you can do within that genera. To be honest i actually hate zombies unless were talking pre night of the living dead hatian voodoo zombies but those have been forgotten and traded in for rediculous braindead monsters whos entire goal is to eat humans its lazy and been done to death, pun intended. This show however is good on its own. The locations, scenery, and the cinematography are all beautiful theres a cohesive plotline eith all the ingredients needed for a great show and even the zombies, while still annoying do a good job of selling it. The way the actors throw their bodies on top of each other and fall into and onto things is actually pretty convincing and goes along way to sell the feel of the pandemic. Most zombie shows have no real point other then the mindless beasts themselves acting mindlessly and killing for no aparent reason. Overall this is a great period horror/drama well worth checking out"
6756,Kingdom,"Caught this while flicking through Netflix. A South Koreon production, it can be watched with subtitles or dubbed. The dubbed version is OK as the voices at least match the characters! It is a period drama with a difference.There is something wrong with The King. He's chained up in his chamber. The village of Dongnae, struggling for food, is eating a soup made from human flesh. The people suddenly start to choke and die but one by one they come back to life. Meanwhile the Crown Prince, Lee Chang and his loyal bodyguard, Mu-yeong set off to find out about his father's illness. Arriving at the village they find it ransacked. Bodies are piled under the floorboards so they drag them out. The survivors of the village appear and tell them they must be put back. It falls on deaf ears and when the sun sets the dead wake and all hell breaks loose!This a brilliant twist on the zombie genre, very well made, with some incredibly tense scenes. The part where they are trying to reach the safety of the village with the infirm on two wagons, and suddenly realise that the dead are sleeping under rocks along the road as the sun starts to set, is a masterclass in suspence.Just finished the 1st series of 6 episodes. To say the last episode was a cliffhanger would be an understatement. Luckily there is a second series. I'm hooked"
6757,Kingdom,"I really wanted to keep watching and watching
this is called a great zombie tv show
You couldn't find better than this tv show."
6758,Kingdom,"I watched Season 1 & 2 subtitled, I recommend you do too.The plot is the crown prince trying to figure out why zombies are attacking his kingdom, and surviving the zombie horde.The writing is good, acting is good, the zombie effects are good, their traditional clothing is historically accurate.Season 1 is a 10/10, you get to see a zombie horde and its great.Season 2 is a 10/10, you again get a zombie horde but with more mystery and drama.Summary: This show is the best zombie show I have ever watched, I look forward to Season 3."
6759,Kingdom,"The best things about Kingdom are its costumes and set design, with some cases of good fight choreography sprinkled throughout the series coming in a distant second place. It was fun and engaging, especially at the beginning, when the plot is moving along fairly quickly, but I started feeling tired by the end of the first season.The 'zombie' theme was already feeling stale and over-explored last decade, and there's nothing particularly original or that stands out about the ones here. Given that, plus a painfully predictable story and several one-dimensional characters, I grew progressively less invested until I finally finished season 2 actively skipping through scenes just to get to the ending."
6760,Kingdom,"To bad the producers could care less about subtitles. Didnt even try to match it
Example written, 'I want an apple'
Example spoken, 'I am desperately starving. I haven't eaten in months, and have been on a long adjurors journey. All for the sake of saving my sister, whom is dying from a really rare disease. Ect ect ect'Would be a much higher rating, if they even tried to come close."
6761,Kingdom,I really like the cast of this drama. Its not your conventional drama that is exciting from episode 1-8 dies down and becomes boring and picks back up towards the end. This drama is shorter with only 6 episodes per season and its perfectly paced and the screenplay is great. The storyline is two fold. On one side you have to deal with the spreading virus and your learning about the attributes of the virus and how it spreads while on the other side you have the political tension between the ruling clan and the crown prince. How the ruling clan is controlling the villages by starving people and making them desperate for help. I like Bae doona's acting too and the drama doesn't hold back in the fight scenes with tons of blood and flesh and animation when needed. Highly recommend this drama to people!!!
6762,Kingdom,"Well written, well acted, well directed, perfect cinematography, fast moving plots, Kingdom is probably the best video/media presentation in a zombie universe. Features multiple realistically gory battles against the undead and the darkly visualized consequences usually glossed over in other Z productions but would be inevitable in zombie outbreaks (i.e., turned mother attacking daughter, children zombies, etc.).The beginning and spread of this Z epidemic is reasonably presented and though there are various sub-plots about power, opposing armies, greed, betrayal, conspiracy. The series doesn't degenerate into the familiar human vs human conflicts with occasional zombie afterthoughts and instead remains good guys vs bad guys PLUS zombies.With no over-the-top martial arts or sword-fights, and no conventional firearms (only the occasional single-shot rife, with one excellent display of tactical artillery, impressive for the 1500's), Kingdom is an entertaining, satisfying addition to the Zombie genre."
6763,Kingdom,"When I first heard about it, I said to my self not another zombies but when I look deeper I always ask a question about this : HOW DO THEY DEAL IT IN ANCIENT TIMES where there isn't any Guns, Explosives or something. And this series is totally flushed out the toxic from my head.The series is so good and so engaging you really can't get off your seat. The most important thing, some episodes are of 1 hours where you didn't feel like you are seeing the long episodes. Even the flashbacks are little one, and they filmed all this in so beautiful manner, you will gonna love to see their traditions and most importantly the locations. Somehow you can feel the terror mererly seeing the locations in this.Zombies are....you know zombies. What gives you kick in this, their craziness, their running. They reveal slowly about the characteristics of zombies (NO SLOW BURN) and you will gonnal love it.Also you can find a beautiful story about a son, a nations would be king, a cunning young step mother, and one Kingdom to acquire for which they create zombies and used against their enemies (LAST EPISODE OF SECOND SEASON WILL MAKE YOU SHOCK). Highly recommended..."
6764,Kingdom,"What can I say? Netflix does it again! Great directing, writing, and acting; overall cinematography is 10/10. Can't wait already for Season 2!"
6765,Kingdom,"If you like Korean movies, if you like political power fights in plots, if you like to watch disgusting sides of the human nature and also the good sides, if you like good acting, if you like period series and if you like zombies you will really enjoy this series. Interesting surprises, very good fighting scenes and really scary zombies."
6766,Kingdom,"Finally, zombie genre sees a massive change with this show. Great story, special effects and acting. Highly recommended !!"
6767,Kingdom,"The best show i have ever watched in my life. Great story, amazing characters, beautiful cinematography and soundtrack. This is the show that everyone involved in the industry should watch and learn on how its done. Just shocked on how briliant this series is. Kudos!!!"
6768,Kingdom,I like this series. But the zombie scene is very rare. I hope to see more zombie in story 2.
6769,Kingdom,Best zombies show ever and very interesting show. Waiting for season 2
6770,Kingdom,"The only thing better than a good zombie movie, is a good zombie series.I could admit that a few questionable decisions were made to move along the story-line, and a few actions/occurrences were quite predictable (much like Western cinema), but if those things are ignored then you have hours of entertainment that you most certainly will not regret.As a side note, I feel like the writers in most zombie films create problems for themselves the minute they start trying to use science or related logic to try to explain what created the undead..... and Kingdom was no exception. I feel it would have been better to leave that part as a mystery.Still, Kingdom is a must watch.... and if you are like me, that means binge watch. I gave it an 8/10 because I just like zombie shows so I am biased."
6771,Kingdom,"The budget is not as big as GOT but it can rival GOT it is much better than stranger things, I am angry because this show is so under rated, the story the action is the best, Not Boring show."
6772,Kingdom,"Doesn't have the budget oh big US productions but the plot, characters and acting are way better than other average series."
6773,Kingdom,"Zombie movie/series pre 20th century! Finally, I have been waiting so long for this to be made and The Kingdom delivers. The story is on point, interesting and at a good pace. There are no unnecessary jump-scares or over the top gore, it's still scary enough. It rivals the walking dead in the makeup department for the ""sick ones"" and finds its way to top my list of best series amongst hundreds of strong contenders.My only problem is the lack of episodes. The acting is good but I feel like the characters aren't getting ""fleshed out"" enough, maybe season 3 will have more episodes.I can't wait!"
6774,Kingdom,"I think its a perfect zombie movie. Acting, cinematography, thrill, mistery, storyboard, & of course the zombies. Top notch."
6775,Kingdom,"Great show. The fact that it's a period piece probably gave it more life than it would have had, had it taken place in more modern times. Just a little bit though, as it also hits the mark in every other category as well.Its just tense enough for horror, has a good amount of action, and has a nice dash of comedy without drifting into the realm of horror / comedy.Overall, a really great show and I am looking forward to season 3.The only real negative of this show is that each season is extremely short, only 6 episodes each. On the other hand, that allows each season to be focused on what quality, and not drift off into bloat.10/10 would watch again."
6776,Kingdom,"Really Korean knows how to make a good movie or series about zombies.
In Kingdom you can see no modern weapons only sword and arrow some old fashioned guns but still it gives you thrill.
The first episode is might be boring but after that it's totaly engaging because of stroy direction emotion and it's action."
6777,Kingdom,"This show combines Game of Thrones-esque political intrigue with The Walking Dead-esque zombie thrills, but it's better than both of those shows. Not only is it the best zombie series I've ever seen, but it's one of the best historical series I've seen as well."
6778,Kingdom,"This new Netflix original Korean zombie series succeeds in surprising with its fast paced narration and a few unexpected twists in a beaten to death genre.
This show takes a new approach by setting the zombie drama in the backdrop of a period show.
The politics of the monarchy forms the content of the screenplay. For the most part the zombie and political part of the show remains seperate but converges as it reaches the culmination point.
The variety of zombie deaths, the types of kills and the adreneline pumping chases are nothing short of great. It didnt hinder the experience in any way.
The locations this was set in,the aerial views and the scenic beauty captured via the lens provides an immersive experience.
The background scoring was good enough to capture and produce the thrill, especially during the final episode.The tone is really dark in this show. Apart from the zombie elements, the treachery and vile of the characters and their actions to protect power is diabolical at the least.The show does seem to slow down in its pace during the middle but compensates with its heart racing finale.The mini plots during the showcase of zombie disease spreading is done well without holding back in its disturbing level.Ultimately, this show is not a complete one and it never intended to be one. It sets up everything for a high potential second season. While doing this, it manages to surprise the viewers during the last episode.This is a short pacy zombie period show which does not demand much of your attention and can be binged as a casual view.PS: If you are new to Korean drama, the antics, goofs and few mannerisms of the actors may seem over the top, but it is sort of unique to the korean culture and is seen in every Korean movie and drama. So don't consider it a flaw in the show"
6779,Kingdom,"I'll start off by saying, I have not read Kingdom of the Gods, so I don't have a personal bias or history with the IP. That said, this series is really enjoyable. So first and foremost, we have something written and produced in South Korea, so that means a few things. Respect for history, no need to throw unnecessary nudity or sexuality in there, the closest we get are awkward romance scenes. And they're totally fine, not cringe at all.Now, I'm gonna say, there's a lot of predictability in this. And some things that seem predictable, but are actually true red herrings. From the get go of the series, you can kind of figure a few things out right off the bat. Yes we can predict exactly what they're doing from the first five minutes, yes the plot reveals are predictable. But to the show's credit, those reveals aren't really meant to surprise an American audience who is used to the zombie genre. This is a show trying to introduce Koreans to zombies in a period drama method.So of our main characters, we have six to deal with. These are your typified archetypes, there's the altruistic prince. He wants to do things differently. There's the prince's best friend (only friend it would seem like). The prince's former master. The vagabond whose skills belie his lowly stature. The herbalist/doctor who wants to try and cure everyone. And I suppose there's the bumbling buffoon coward who will eventually man up and become a power player if he lives long enough. This is your typical hero's journey where the hero loses everything, and has to risk life and limb to save everyone, while also trying to take back his birthright. But it's still such a good series.As I said earlier, there's no nudity in this series (so far anyway), and it's very tasteful. The villains at first seem fairly 2 dimensional and we can guess what their motives are, and why we should hate them. But appearances can be deceiving, and there might be more than meets the eye. But you probably will still end up hating them, because they're your typical vile archetypes who see people as disposable and have a plan. Now unlike American television where they'd reveal those plans, they don't tell you what their goals or their motivations are. The Queen seems like a mere puppet just doing what she's told, but is she? What is the Minister's plan? Is everyone the hero travels with trustworthy?I really really hope that there's a season 2 and that it arrives expediently, because I'd love to see what happens next. And hopefully more than 6 episodes!"
6780,Kingdom,"Good story, a slightly new take on how zombies came about. Tense, suspenseful action. I'm a fan. Season 2 is out now and so far, just as good as season 1."
6781,Kingdom,"Rich in plot and character development, Kingdom is a rare gem that is well beyond the mediocre cinema produced these days. Everything about this series is outstanding. The cinematography, the story line, the costume and scenery, the suspense and element of surprise. The acting! I'm in awe. Easily one of the greatest shows of all time, hands down."
6782,Kingdom,"This series is amazing. Pretty much every horror show I've ever seen was set in the present, and set in America. It was great to see a series where they didn't have guns to solve their problems, and their rural population made zombies a much bigger threat. Not to mention is was scary to have fast zombies instead of the walking dead where they are just kind of an inconvenience. I also really liked that the characters were actually smart. There was a whole episode that didn't have a single zombie in it, it was just them preparing their castle for the attack. The set design, makeup, costumes, hair and cinematography was amazing as well. Really liked this show, looking forward to season two!"
6783,Kingdom,"What a brilliant story with perfect casting, sound, effect, music and photography.Best Zombie TV-Serie that I've ever seen.And now, we have to wait for 2nd season."
6784,Kingdom,Kingdom is perfect for viewers who do not like horror. Kingdom offers enough fright for it to be enjoyable yet balances it with storytelling which makes the mixture of this Tv series addictive.
6785,Kingdom,"Much better than expected.When most of the zombies film/series can be boring and repetitive, this one was very good from the beginning until the end of the 2nd season.I hope we will get a 3rd season , will watch it.The story and the characters are nice too, it's a must-watch for fans of survival."
6786,Kingdom,"Absolutely epic program. This is hands down the best horror series I have watched in the last few years. Great set pieces, editing, atmosphere, characters, narrative & music. This is engaging and chilling at times. Action packed without being cheesy or boring. A+++"
6787,Kingdom,"What an amazing show Im not a fan of the Zombie genre bc Hollywood made the same mistake everytime and all their shows are literally the same
But this show is was too good
Cant wait for season 3"
6788,Kingdom,"I thought I write a review of the show since I was looking forward to the series when it was released. I had finally watched the last episode of Season 1 of the Korean Zombie TV series Kingdom. Episode 1 started very strongly with great cinematography, beautiful sets and costumes, building up a good story followed by episode 2 showing us who the zombies are. From there it just went downhill. Everything then is watered down.**Kingdom - Spoiler alert*
There were lack of character development for most of its main characters. The worst part is that the director failed in the many little detail of the shows. For most parts everyone's costumes look like its always so clean and ironed every time. If it isn't that, the dirt on their clothes and their face look so painted and amateurish. Doona Bae, the star from Sense8 was given a character that constantly look sad and suffering. She is best remembered always out in the field digging for herbs. What a waste of talent. In one scene in Ep 6, the director made her to do an over exaggerate expression when looking for herbs. That just spoiled it for me.In some scenes where they tried to inject humour by the supporting characters but it fell flat and lame. It might work for Korean TV dramas but not for an international audience. The final episode 6 was underwhelming with almost no zombies in sight. You sat through the full episode but no big battle and no clip hanger? What an anti-climate. Some websites review had tried to compare it to Game of Thrones. But it is not."
6789,Kingdom,This is one of my favorite series of all time. Something different and refreshing zombie show that separates itself from every other zombie stories. I loved everything about this awesome drama! Highly recommend!
6790,Kingdom,"Kingdom has a great start, awesome cinematography and a story that is ridden with plotholes and logic errors from the beginning to the end.
Lots of the characters make incomprehensible decisions that seem only to be there to fuel the storyline. And lots of the story seems to be very far-fetched if you think about it. (I don't wanna put spoilers here, but the whole ""who has the right to be king"" storyline is already flawed).
Also lots of scenes are so obscenely dragged out, that I had to fast forward some of them.
But, if you look past these sometimes very obvious mistakes, Kingdom is still an entertaining series, visually great and fun to watch.
I just wished it'd have made more sense."
6791,Kingdom,"This is like one of the best ever zombie apocs EVER! (oh wait...SMALLPOX.... lol)
Then after the episode 6 shocker it literally was like WTF moment.
This was crazy, insane and amazing how they set this series up and I'm starting to even wonder if they will need help from outside sources (like Japan) to their help/ aid if needed but since this was taken place in a different time era with unexpected turns (not to spoil more) this has got my definite attention and I am impatiently want to see what happens in the next season!!DAMN THIS WAS GOOD"
6792,Kingdom,"Has to be one of the best series in 2019 by netflix, I know I know its only january just now. But what a beginning to the year. You cannot miss it. Just wrapped up the season its brilliant all the way through. Beautiful costumes, amazing cinematography , brilliant gore, hints of comedy, good balanced action. Not too much of anything and not too little. Great gripping storyline throughout with an amazing lead role.
Not a spoiler ***** i died laughing at the head-cuffs scene ***** u'll know when u see it."
6793,Kingdom,"One of the larger Korean series, this serial makes you frequented dose of the adrenalin in each ring of his episodes, fighting by swords, guns and bowl in everything the wonderful series"
6794,Kingdom,"Ohh man...This series is getting better by season to seasons.. What can i say, just watch it and decide. More seasons will come and I am Egarly waiting for them..."
6795,Kingdom,Absolutely loved the first series of this. Some politics but otherwise a simple plot and lots of zombies! Second series was more political and disjointed; was pretty dissatisfied with the ending; the ice scene was a bit daft and I'm not sure who that actually was at the end! Okay but could be so much better with better writing.
6796,Kingdom,"Firstly, I am not a big fan of Zombie flicks, it's always the same - some virus and all plus people surviving and all the director's focus is how people survive the zombie thing.
But man o man! Even though this show is a zombie centered drama, zombies are only one component ( a very valuable one though) of this series. It has an actual story! Brilliant actors, editing is superb and there is not just one wasted/stupid scene in the whole 2 seasons, attention to details, the sets, the costumes, the locations, everything very well thought of. The zombie attacks are scary( and action packed) and you feel claustrophobic and you are always on the edge of the seat - these are not your slow marathon Zombie runners, they are Usian Bolts!All in all I would give it 10 stars, but 10 is perfection, but this show comes pretty close to what it wants to achieve! Dare is say better than The walking dead ? Just because there are no funky super-heroes but just normal people who are as vulnerable as we are ?Go watch it NOW!!"
6797,Kingdom,"Didnt expect much but was surprised , comming from the dissapoitment that is the walking dead , i assure you that you wont be dissapointed"
6798,Kingdom,This is by far one of the best series I have watched on Netflix. I thoroughly enjoyed this from beginning to end. Well done to everyone such a brilliant show!
6799,Kingdom,"Finally something nicely done i really enjoied it, good acting reasonable and nice effect ."
6800,Kingdom,"Overall a good show to watch. Engaging and good acting, good flow of story and great picture quality except one big gaping hole in the story at the end. I usually do not like the story with some illogical plots somewhere.The nurse already found out that the walking-deass do not like water, but at the end, when they ransacked the palace, she did not say anything to the prince when she saw him except to cry like a baby and did not act like someone who was the most knowledgeable one on this decease that was killing everyone. And the prince? While facing the bad queen, acted like he had to request her to step down after he knew what she's been doing with the whole plot?Comon!!"
6801,Kingdom,Netflix is getting way better every year just an amazing zombie serie its like game of thrones meet the walking dead
6802,Kingdom,What a stupid plot for the 2nd season. They made the prince so stupid.
6803,Kingdom,I hope Netflix do more Family friendly series that I can enjoy with my family and have a great production.
6804,Kingdom,"Overall it's a good one, season 2 was lot better than season 1 in lot of aspects."
6805,Kingdom,"Zombie category series.
What I loved the most is the era in which it was shot.
production design is fantabulous.
Cinematography is also good.A must watch series."
6806,Kingdom,So much better than what the UK or the USA can deliver.
6807,Kingdom,"It is very important that with horror (or any ambigious plotline) that the pacing is slow and gradual before the story is unleashed to us. However, with season 1, the pace failed to pick up and was slightly underwhelming. With season 2 the pace was hectic and much faster but within shorter episodes. This matched the genre better and led to more action but felt a tad rushed. S1 and S2 bearing just 6ep a piece was less than originally planned. They were both supposed to have 8 episodes and with s2 you can really tell as you can also with the criminal season one ending whcih would have left me irritated had the 2nd not been available.In regards to the plot, questions do have to be asked, the plague seems to vary dependant on our protagonists but everyone has plot armour these days so its the writers jobs to get around this. They do an ok job but i cant help but raise an eyebrow at some of the plot points. Other than this the story is pretty well written. The only other issue i have is that the story becomes too wrapped up in the internal politics and forgets about the zombies running loose in the background.Overall, the series is a breath of fresh air, the time period and location of the zombie outbreak creates a unique environment which is definitely one i found interest in. The characters share a decent range of depth and all contain indivdual motives which is expressed clearly throughout. It is an enjoybale cinematic series and that is why i still rate this show an 8/10 despite the criticsim."
6808,Kingdom,"So i already wrote a review but after watching any film/serie i tend to criticise specific details rather than expressing the bigger picture. I will try to quickly summarise 'Kingdom' from season 1 & 2 especially as i realise more international viewers will be interested in Korean cinema following 'Squid Game'.Kingdom begins as an ominous horror and diverges into a political battle for the throne. Although the zombies are prominent in the beginning and end, they do tend to go missing inbetween. Each character has individual motives and all convey very different character tropes, yet some are too cliche and are almost laughable. The story consists of a few twists and turns and contains a strong spine throughout the series. The pacing of the first season is quite slow compared to the exceptionally fast paced second. The overall cinema is great, the practical effects are brilliant and the zombies are terrifying. The environment is unique, being set in a medieval zombie outbreak in Korea, this provides an extra tension as communication and defence is weak.8/10 Worth a watch but nothing groundbreaking."
6809,Kingdom,"I'm hooked after just the first episode!
This was AWESOME!"
6810,Kingdom,"If you're a fan of a great story, great acting, amazing landscapes & colour and zombies....what??? Then this is definitely for you! Cant remember the last time a show (probably GOT) got me this hooked this quickly. With only 6 shows in the season & a cliffhanger ending, season 2 needs to come ASAP."
6811,Kingdom,"Season 2 is better than s1...
Last episode was ultimate"
6812,Kingdom,"If someone's missing the early seasons of The Walking Dead, this will be a diamond. The story-line is really solid and the pace of the show is amazing.The best thing is, this doesn't have filler episodes and boring rewind scenes. Just try this for 15 minutes, you'll definitely binge watch all the episodes."
6813,Kingdom,"I've been waiting for this series to come out since the start of january, and I've got to say it has paid off. I think it was George A. Romero, who once said that Horror was a way for him to make a social statement and guess this series somehow delivers that in a great way (in one episode there's a strange- and quite actual- discussion on what to do with the bodies of working and high society people). There's also the long and neverending question between slow and fast zombies. After Train to Busan we got a peek to what South Korea seems to prefer, and I'm glad with this, but if you add the fact that these zombies share also some similarities with vampires (the fact that they're scared/damaged by light) it just climb up to other levels of awesomeness. I would like to say that what most attracted me to this series is the fact that the zombie Genre had long been quite unexploited and Kingdom is a rare gem because not only it's an era drama/horror series but also all the things I've stated before. I see it as a genre disruption (which for me is a good thing)."
6814,Kingdom,"I went into this show expecting a normal zombie movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The zombies and sfx are AMAZING, and the characters are all portrayed very well. The plot is really well paced in my opinion, and each episode leads to new insights on the politics and plague.This is definitely the best zombie show I have ever watched. It is so unique, especially with its Joseon Era setting.Moreover, I am usually not a fan of political drama, but the political drama in this show is really well done! There is a perfect mix of zombies and politics. Definitely the coolest thing ever. It's an overall really badass show! I highly highly recommend."
6815,Kingdom,Slow build but totally worth it. Just becoming more and more epic. Like no zombie show/movie I've seen before.
6816,Kingdom,"Reading reviews it seems to be a love it or hate it series. Definitely not deserving of 1 star votes but not flawless. Seems like people are exaggerating on both scores.Back to my personal opinion. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I wasn't sure what to expect from it and it definitely surpassed my expectations. I'm normally not the biggest fan of zombie movies; they're done to death and usually follow the same trend line. That or you never feel like the main characters will ever get touched or hurt. To an extent this is the case with this series, we never really expect the Prince to turn into a zombie early on. But others around are less indispensable.To the series as a whole. Not knowing much about Korean culture it feels authentic enough. With outfits, buildings, customs etc. The storyline feels plausible and with the weaponry the spread of ""disease"" has more credibility. Something lacking in most modern takes on zombies. The storyline can be slow at times but overall it has a strong thread whilst jumping to different areas of the country to forward the plot.However, it's not without flaws. The actions of some people are slightly comical and there is definitely a lot of overacting going on. It does slightly undermine the feel at times.But as a whole, highly recommended and enjoyable series. Well worth watching if you enjoy zombies or aren't usually a fan."
6817,Kingdom,"After watching both seasons 1 & 2. Hoping to get the new season.. Sooner.... Can't wait..Brilliant, breath taking, superb story.. From A to Z.. KINGDOM is a must watch...!!"
6818,Kingdom,"After wasting 10 years of my life on the walking dead only to give up before I got to the end I realised after watching this what a proper missed opportunity it was.This has action, mood, atmosphere, scares and horror which justify its rating, a must for all horror fans, watch and be enthralled."
6819,Kingdom,Season 1 was a blast 10/10What's my verdict after watching the second season? It's as good as the first one with one minor flaw- the ending could've been much intriguing even if they had a season three on mind. Other that it deserves 10/10 again.
6820,Kingdom,"I came into this not expecting much. I didn't even think that I would make it through the first episode. It kept me watching. The more I watched the more I became addicted. Great zombie movie. I'm getting so tired of our (USA) versions. It's always the same here, great job!"
6821,Kingdom,"I have some issues with this, but overall I really like it - it just keeps moving. The short run length of 6 episode for the first series is a breath of fresh air after drawn out shows like the marvel ones and umbrella academy.This was obvious in the second episode when our ""heroes"" needed to find someone and they were in the Frozen Valley - as soon as I heard that, I was prepared for a long drawn out journey to said Frozen Valley - but no - they were there in the next scene! This is very jarring compared to a US show that can draw out any event over several years, so it was refreshing to see a plot move along at pace.On the downside, I don't like my zombies to only come out at night and move quickly - the scary thing about zombies is while one is easily despatched through decapitation, they just keep coming and you are overwhelmed by slow moving numbers."
6822,Kingdom,"Great story line. Serious and funny.
This show is definitely packed full of suspense too.
Scenes are delivered perfectly to get your heart racing, and then at the very last minute you get your relief. There's plenty of gore and blood which is not overly done and more realistic.
I love how the zombies are fast too.
These are all good zombie show/movie qualities in my book, and we unfortunately don't get a lot these nowadays. Zombie stuff is my jam and I wish there was much much more coming out. Hint hint.
In any case, A must watch!"
6823,Kingdom,"Just finished season 2 (credits rolling as I type), and I'm gutted it's ended. Binge-watched the last 3 episodes and the finale is one of the most gripping, tense and frustrating ever! Great acting, action and intrigue from S1 Ep2 right through to S2 Ep3, there just HAS to be a 3rd series!"
6824,Kingdom,Just amazing.. best zombie series in a long time. Watched season 1 and 2 in 1 weekend non-stop. It's not boring and goood pace. Story is acceptable and logical. Season 3 will be amazing. Cant wait for it. True Gem and a must match.
6825,Kingdom,"Character development? Plot? Music? Action? Drama? What ever the question is, it is insanely good. In comparison, The Walking Dead TV series does not even came close to Kingdom. It was super good, i cannot express myself more. Insanely good."
6826,Kingdom,Whoa!what a series.Thank you Netflix for this amazing series.Hope s3 continues....
6827,Kingdom,"The idea of zombies in medieval times was not that appealing to me at first, but ended up being a perfect combination of political strategy and action. Great acting. This is one of the examples why Netflix is worth it."
6828,Kingdom,Having never watched any Asian production I stumbled on this show late at night and I was immediately hooked ! Loving the history and story behind it and it kept me edge if my seat.Do not miss this show !
6829,Kingdom,"I wasn't expecting much from a show I never seen anything abour nor any of my friends talking about but I was pleasantly surprised. The story is good, the characters are likeable, and the locations of the filming are something to look at. The only complaint I have is when I got to the end of episode 6, I came to the realization that this was the last episode I get to watch for now. With some quick searching my hopes were not crushed and I will get to enjoy a season 2 in the near future."
6830,Kingdom,"Even if you don't call it Zombies, that's what they are, and the best way to explain the spread of the desease is with a virus.First it was a plant that you had to smash and put in with the help of a needle. Then it was something you can get after eating perfectly well cooked human meat. Then it was warms, you eat the eggs and they grow inside of your body. Warms that live inside the body, but drawn when you are below water... what a complete nonsense.First season was slow but quite ok, second season was really bad, I am not watching the third one."
6831,Kingdom,They have done a good job with this serie. The story and the setting is very good.Now lets hope that Netflix will not cancel this like most of there series.
6832,Kingdom,"If you remotely like East Asian productions in general and Korean ones in particular and are a fan of the horror and zombie genre as well, this one is for you and not to miss. Add to that a historical setting with many subplots and subtext, and you get an idea of what kind of complete package this series is.
The only bad thing I could say about it is, that it ended after just six episodes and only half the answers were given with me wanting to get more of that show.
Strongly recommended."
6833,Kingdom,"I am big fan of zombie movies and to TheWalkingDead was the peak of zombie movies. But now Kingdom delivers bloodshed, paranoia and mystery which is similar in TWD season1.9/10"
6834,Kingdom,"This is a phenomenal show. I was bored and was looking for a show to hook into when i found this and boy isn't this a fun show. Although it is a zombie show it has more to it, from character arcs to politics to action to emotions it has everything, hell! it's even funny at times, the production is top notch, acting is even better, directing drives the story at the right pace, i would definitely recommend this, can't wait for the second season"
6835,Kingdom,Such a brilliant 1 season an then other mind blowing season and now I'm already looking forward to third season. Season 2 is fast paced and you'll finish the whole show in one go. Now as the virus is making us sit at home. This is perfect show to pass your time.
6836,Kingdom,This series is amazing. The stories are well told and the action is non stop. Both seasons left us wanting more with awesome cliffhangers. I'm waiting hopefully for a 3rd season.
6837,Kingdom,Nothing much new to add comments wise but wanted to rate and leave a review because it's so good. Fantastic Korean zombie/dynasty drama. For me Walking Dead meets Game of Thrones. Cannot wait for a 3rd series and finally getting round to watching Kingdom: Ashin of the North to keep me going. May rewatch 1 & 2 in the meantime.
6838,Kingdom,"I'm not big on giving full 10/10 to anything, because I always believe in room for improvement. So we finally get a k-drama, samurai's, and zombies all packed into a nice 6 episode season. I loved the show from start to finish. It had a few slow parts, but honestly they spent good time building up characters which I liked. When crap hits the fan; it gets fun. Just the way papa likes it. rofl. They added a really nice twist to zombies in this series as well. I'm a fan for adding your own ideas and flare to how a zombie should act, but I had one hell of a grin on my face when.......oh, I guess you should watch the season finale and see what I was going to say?!The 1 and 2 star reviews don't seem to be zombie fans. They should go back and watch the movie Titanic or something. Leave this genre to the adults that like heads flying off and arms being eaten. Thanks and have a nice day."
6839,Kingdom,This is how a zombie movie is done!!! I was so engaged while watching this. It really is a must see.
6840,Kingdom,What a great series even though I am not a fan of subtitles I could not wait until the next episode. This is cerntialy a must see. Can be a bit gory at times. I cannot wait until the next season is out.
6841,Kingdom,"This series is so amazing, it's well shot, scripted and everything just seems well thought out and makes you want more as each episode gets better. Can't wait for the next season. Please don't judge a book by it's title and just watch it! You won't regret it. Never thought I'd like a zombie series so much. It's way better than Hollywood zombies. 10/10 recommend!!"
6842,Kingdom,"I don't hand out 10s lightly (the last one was 4 years ago for The Expanse); after a second watch - yes, it is that good - I am confident to say that this is as good as it gets. Every other Netflix show take note, this is the show to beat and the task will be impossible considering the average quality of Netflix shows.Everything is absolutely stunning, from the acting to the wardrobe to the atmosphere; wow. I don't think it's possible to overstate how fantastic this first season is.Watch this if you love good television.Don't watch this if you can't read subtitles and think good television is ""reality"" TV or cringey shows (eg. The Flash)."
6843,Kingdom,"Wow. Just wow. This is your typical Korean drama done exactly the same as all the other Korean dramas with a lot of the same actors/actresses you'd normally see except with zombies. A LOT of zombies. Very hungry fast moving pissed off zombies. What makes this show unique and possibly one of the best zombie shows I've ever seen is not just the superb acting, but the complexity of the show. There's political and economical problems going on along with their undead problem. After the season ends you're sitting there wanting more and absolutely loving some of the actors/actresses."
6844,Kingdom,"Nearly everyone, including the main protagonist, are incredible stupid. Most of their decisions make no sense, even though the writer seemed to have the intention to have them look heroic. I don't want to go into any details, because i don't want to spoil anything.
Some of the characters are intentional stupid, probably to add some humor ... it failed. To give general examples, the protagonists just stand there when something is happening, watching, watching, until it's nearly too late, then they act. This happens not once, but everytime something happens. The main protagonist is supposed to be a crown prince and has some fighting skills and can write, but he has no clue of leadership, strategy or whatever, even though the series makes us believe he was raised as a prince. A lot of people die or get infected because of their stupidity.
Everything is just duct-taped to rise tention.When you shut off your brain, the series may be fun to watch. The acting is acceptable and sometimes even good, the cinematography is enjoyable and the action scenes are well made. Therefore not all is bad.Alltogether this series is highly overrated and there are tons of (korean) series that are way better."
6845,Kingdom,"Watched the entire series in 2 nights, and with no expectations. I just watched the trailer.I couldn't honestly believe how good this show is, was totally hooked and obsessed after 20 minutes of it staring and couldn't stop watching it.Can not wait for the second series to start in March"
6846,Kingdom,"Love Zombie movies, but was not expecting Revolution/War/Palace intrigue. All done at a high level. One of the best shows I've seen in years. Fantastic, binge worthy Netflix at its best."
6847,Kingdom,Kingdom is one of those rare zombie gems you dont find often.
6848,Kingdom,"Direction was brilliant, all the characters are done their job well excellent acting from lead role. Don't miss this great one. It is far more better than game of thrones and money heist as all are trending these 2 shows."
6849,Kingdom,"I struggled to figure out how to rate it, was the story is very much mediocre for the Zombie genre, but then i remembered that WWZ has a 7 and this is better than world war Z by miles. It had an interesting premise, and a lot of space to explore all kinds of problems and situations in a post war ravaged country, plagued by an outbreak of zombies, unfortunately in the end it doesnt really feel like it really dives into any of them. It acts as if it doesnt have time.Its beautiful, the shots, costumes, scenery, is gorgeous. The acting is fine, even tho theres some aestetic/mood choices being made that make it feel a bit wonky sometimes.This series has 0 faith in their audience, and things will be repeated and explained to you directly, just in case someone doesnt get it. So If you watch movies often and are paying attention, you will catch yourself rolling your eyes, or wishing they would just move along.Season 2 feels very messy, especially with pacing. It very much feels like they were debating how much time they have to wrap up the story during the entire season, so some things feel rushed and some dragged out for no reason.I will watch season 3 if it comes out. Even with all of its flaws its entertaining enough, and the extra time devoted to figuring out how this plague works, how it came to be etc. Is honestly interesting, and it will be interesting how they explain it further. I wonder where they will go with this. The cast is interesting enough and it just keeps moving, showing you more of this world and this disease.Spoilers ahead:This series has very little tension, even if you care for the characters, you are very much aware that no one on the main cast will die, and just waiting to see what red shirt will fall. You can still have a lot of fun by having the characters do something creative or interesting to get out of the situation but they usually dont (props to the flaming robe to get through the zombies tho). It very much thinks its suspensful, you will get shots that should be cliff hangers or get you concerned, but really if youre paying attention you know where they are going. Again if youre naive enough you might believe they are in danger all the time, but if you know you know. :)The zombie rules are inconsistent. One minute they are mindless beasts yeeting themselves into spikes or whatever is in their way to get to the humans and the next they shy away from fire and water and stand around like good little zombies. They are said to be hungry for human flesh but they dont really eat anyone, they just kinda munch on them and then leave to hunt someone else. The sunlight/temperature thing doesnt seem to make much sense. I wont go that much into it, since season 2 tells us there seems to be much more to how this works than what we and the characters thought, so im giving them a fair shake that they might explain it better later on. I personally liked the idea of ''when winter ends and spring comes this will all be over'', only to have them slowly understand that this something that is now permanently in the world, and will require a lot from everyone. At least I hope thats where they are going, and Id personally really like that as a theme for the show.Peoples behaviors arent the brightest from the start but it starts wilding in season 2. Ill just say I could somehow suspend my disbelief for the Queens storyline, but when we got to our main cast and palace guards slicing their palms to get attention from the zombies, when literally in season 1 they used the same strategy except they had the brains to slice their forearms, you know in case they actually need to use their hands to handle weapons and such, they seem to have 0 problem with these cuts when they fight the zombies 5 minutes later. Our prince punching the ice with his bare hands, when he previously used his sword to yeet through a roof is painful to watch."
6850,Kingdom,"All time favorite for me😍😍💯💯
One of the best zombie flick. I really loved watching every minute of the show. If you're fan of zombies then must watch for you.😍"
6851,Kingdom,"Yes, the title is in complete caps lock. In fact, this whole review should've been. But I digress, this Korean series which now spans 2 seasons is on equal footing as the first seasons of Game of Thrones. The hierarchy in the collectivist culture of feudal Korea is excellently portrayed here, and used as a plot element in order to diversify the cast between good and evil: The need for equal treatment and helping each other or the need for power and being a manipulative totalitarian ruler.The cinematography is amazing with tons of beautiful set pieces and camera trickery, fantastic lighting included.The acting is suberb presented by an all star Korean cast that will suck you in the screen.The production is extremely well done, you feel you are in feudal Korea with special effects to write home about.The direction and story move in a clever way. The pacing is never too slow, the writing never corny and the visual story telling is done at it's best here. It's a true adventure, with unique elements to the zombies that make it original.There are only good things to say about this series. After Parasite the Korean Cinema is booming, and this series continues the trend of delivering quality that many Western production could be jealous of. Go see it now seriously."
6852,Kingdom,"Netflix's Kingdom (2019) spent most of the first season's time setting up semi-dystopian world, which was brilliantly played-out by its cinematography and screenplay with some game of thrones undertones.Exhibiting its hierarchical society's problem on health, politics, and poverty in a way that the ""Undead"" became just a complication of their kingdom's failure. Pretty awesome that the head of state was the patient-0 as if an ant queen was killed and we were just watching its colony to collapse.The origin, design, and mechanism of the undead, appeared quite distinctive and iconic among present zombie genre. Thanks to its proper direction each episode reveals something about the undead in a satisfyingly-paced story.The whole season went well with its intense climax per episode, presenting storylines that filled-out my world-setting cravings."
6853,Kingdom,"There is a creator, Kim Eun-hee. There is a director, Kim Seong-hun. NOT NETFLIX, ok? Ok.
It is like a dorama that replaced the romance for zombies. I thought it was a bad idea but it was not. And thank to the zombies, I'm watching this historical Korean place with my boyfriend."
6854,Kingdom,"Firstly I have to say the zombie genre is not a favourite of mine,but the two seasons of this Netflix is just fabulous. Yes some of the acting by the lesser cast is a tad wooden,the main players are spot on. From everything from the myriad storyline to the wonderful visuals it's definitely worth a watch,& as I say I don't like zombie films,but that is only half of the plot lines. It's also about a battle against good leaders against evil leaders. Warning,there's a lot of blood letting involved but surprisingly it doesn't seem gratuitous. The end of series 2 leaves it all open fora series 3,I hope that is in the pipeline"
6855,Kingdom,"I love Korean movies displayed during the Joseon period and as a thriller fan myself, I binged watched this movie (season 1 and 2) in 2 nights and I must say that it edge if the seat, suspenseful and thrilling movie from beginning to end. I enjoyed it and the characters and director did a wonderful job on this one. I recommend it if you haven't watched it yet."
6856,Kingdom,"Good story to go along with some of the most intense, suspenseful zombie action I've ever seen. So good. Just so, so good."
6857,Kingdom,This Korean series is completely ridiculous. The acting is bad. The dialogue is utter stupid. It seems like most of those Asian series have illogical stories what makes them very unwatchable and frustrating. Only the cinematography is properly executed in this failed Netflix attempt. I can only conclude that the fake high rating reviews are made by payed Netflix trolls.
6858,Kingdom,"Echoing the other reviews on here, this drama/horror show/period piece is a magical conglomeration of genres. Great acting by all! The sets are amazing, the makeup for the undead is topnotch, and the social commentary is interesting. AND THE HATS! What a way to learn about a culture through their historic headwear. I am eagerly awaiting season two! Bravo!"
6859,Kingdom,"One of the best zombie shows I ever seen ! I thought this show is just comedian type from koreans and started the first episode and since then I didn't leave the screen until I finish it, Since netflix play the episodes automatically I didn't notice the show has 6 episodes only I got upset I wanted more fighting zombies with swords and rarely with guns it's super amazing and they run so fast which make it harder to escape and they woke up only after sunset it's the real zombies I'm so excited for the next season you will probably hit your head on the wall because of the ending it's will be hard for you to wait and know what happened and how they survived from that attack Korea + Netflix = Gold Work !"
6860,Kingdom,I'm obsessed with this show!!! Please continue and come out with a season 3 pleeeeeaaaasee. The ending got me struck!
6861,Kingdom,"This show has been nothing short of incredible. The parallels to Game of Thrones are there. Palace intrigue. Check. Heroes and bad guys. Check. Army of the dead. Check. Evil queen. Check.
No dragons though.
Satisfying ending? Check. In this, not Game of Thrones."
6862,Kingdom,"This definitely is a good series to watch if you like crude zombie movies. The series slowly builds up while keep getting better. Even though I understood it with subtitles, it didn't matter much. The story, direction and action are good. It can be ranked somewhere near ""Train to Busan""."
6863,Kingdom,"This is the first serie in a long time I felt very obsessed with and I consider this as one of the 💎 you can find on Netflix.This is basically Korean version of the zombie plague in medieval times. I really appreciate the concept and uniqueness of the serie. This zombie theme is different than popular, a little bit overated one. A lot of movies about gut eaters are basically one and the same thing with occasional twists such as extra speed or some sort of inteligence, whatever. This one is different, and I truly recommend this to every zombie fan. Also, the scenerio itself plus the great acting and characters make this serie special. There is just so much effort invested in this production, but I would understand if for some viewer the plot is moving forward too slow. Besides, I have seen already few other productions played by Ju Ji-Hoon and I consider him an very interesting and talented actor.I think the first season was better than the second one, which is focused more on the political aspect of the conflicts between Prince and Cho Hak Joo, which not everyone might enjoy as much as the action from first season. However, both of them are really, really good. I also like how the reality of the poorest and low born looked like at that time, which was really rough. I mean, I'm not so sure if it was really that bad, or is it a little bit exaturated but it makes the whole serie so deep and ruthless. There were obviously few things I was not pleased about, mostly in second season which might seems a little bit lost sometimes, and I feel truly disappointed with 2 last episodes. I mean, I can't wait to see the third season but the way they ended up the second one was completely not what I was expected, besides, my second favorite character turned out a traitor and died 😭"
6864,Kingdom,"I just finished watching season 2 and it is AMAZING, i mean everything, art, style, cinematography, plot, characters... It feels like a mix between Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead (this is much better than TWD btw), i really hope Netflix make a season 3 and dont ruin it with SJW stuff.It's a shame that something so good is so unknown."
6865,Kingdom,Doesn't overdo the zombie shindig. Delicate and precise in the way it's shot. Would recommend.
6866,Kingdom,"I wouln't say I'm a huge fan of asian movies, but after Train to Busan I had to give chance this korean newcomer. And god almighty, it was definetely one of my decisions in the past months. This is a masterpiece. First of all: evetything is beautiful and authentic. The landscape, the scenery, the costumes are all vibrant and exciting. The acting is nearly flawless, even if the only face I've seen before is Doona Bae's. It's a bit difficult at the beginning to remember the faces, who's who, where and why but once you're familiar, you'll get permanently hooked.The way they treat the zombie question (how they born, how they act etc.) is refreshing and terrifiying at the same time. Huge ups fro the directing and storytelling, I love how they started the action scenes in small, not even showing what happened, only the aftermath. This made the vievers assume the creators didn't have enough money for large scenes with a lot of extras. But how wrong we were! From the middle of the show it's packed with grandiose and brutal action scenes, with bloody close-ups and horrifíying grand totals.I'd recommend it to everyone who loves zombie show, it'll be your new favorite I guarantee!"
6867,Kingdom,"Drama, horror, comedy, action, adventure, all in one. Trust me, you don't want to miss this. Well done Netflix"
6868,Kingdom,"I first hesitant to see the movie, because I tought it would be just a political old kingdom movie. But I was wrong, this movie is just breathtaking. I love the story where the Prince has to fight for his position in the Kingdom, but have to defend his people from the plague at the same time.
I love all the characters, specially the prince, he grow so much, and become a better person, stronger and wiser man each day. All the people around him are intriguing, and have some mistery behind their character.
The female lead also fascinating, she is the physician. She shows that strong women doesn't always nedd the ability to fight or using weapon to defeat the enemies. She use her knowledge, experience, and her instict to survive.
All I can say that, this by far is the best zombie/ horror movie to date. Love every second of it, and leave me wanting more everytime the episode ended."
6869,Kingdom,"It took the first episode into the 2nd to get a feel for it then I fell in love. Great show! Great cast, i like the way it's a zombie flick yet feels different. It has a horror aspect that seems darker than most zombie flicks. Just great sad to figure out I already watched a whole season."
6870,Kingdom,"This show is so worth watching, a zombie story with depth!That is something you never get, it has an interesting storyline running all the way through, not about zombies.They are more like a secondary storyline.The zombies are not like you see in most other shows, they are there and they attack but the focus is not on the blood and gore, they are wild people, not slow walking bones.The story is about people doing anything to gain ultimate power.The zombies are referred to as monsters, but truly it is the humans that are far worse.So far the show has been very surprising, there are tender moments,
great displays of loyalty and revenge, along with espionage and evil doings.The fight scenes are plausable, not the typical Chinese martial arts over the top stuff, no one flying through the sky or running up walls.It is really one of the best zombie based shows I have ever seen, the movie is good too. I hate subtitled material, but I don't mind this at all, it is well worth it. Even if you are fed up of zombie stuff, watch it, as I said it isn't the main focus.So watch it, enjoy some good writing, acting, scenery and special effects."
6871,Kingdom,"1 season is very good, and season 2 is politics and almost No monsters and the ending is Just rubbish."
6872,Kingdom,"If you like Zombies, this is definitely a must-watch. I watched the whole thing in a day because it's short. However, I took several breaks to text people back or watch Youtube videos. That would not have happened if it had REALLY captured me. I like the idea of Zombies in the Joseon era, the production is great, the cinematography beautiful, the acting good. There were definitely some really suspenseful scenes where I barely dared to breathe. But there was not really anything that touched me.I don't feel like I got to know the characters at all, so I did not get attached to them - not even to the Crown Prince. The only character I enjoyed a bit more was the guard played by Kim Sang Ho, whom I've adored ever since ""City Hunter"" (2011).Furthermore, I think a better OST would have greatly improved my emotional investment. Am I gonna watch season 2? Yes. But is ""Kingdom"" gonna be on my all-time-favorite Drama list? No."
6873,Kingdom,10 out of 10. The acting is great the storyline even better. The zombies are the best creepiest zombies I've ever seen! Cant wait for season 3
6874,Kingdom,"This series brilliantly combines political intrigue, vampire horror, and Korean history into one tightly woven story. The production value of this series is way above value, and be prepared to become an instant addict of the show."
6875,Kingdom,Intense! intense! intense! everyone should really watch it especially in this pandemic times..
6876,Kingdom,"I think the beginning of a new for Korean series
Hollywood should take notes from this Masterpiece"
6877,Kingdom,It's a must much korean thriller drama ..! 6 episodes is not enough though..!!!
6878,Kingdom,You won't stop watching until it ends..! Beautiful story line and production design..!
6879,Kingdom,I didnt know anything about this series when i started watching it. Then i ended up binge watching all 6 episodes at nite!!! I love zombie films n by far this tops them all!!
6880,Kingdom,"Another korean masterpiece. Nothing to say more. Just watch,a wonderful thrilling experience ahead."
6881,Kingdom,"Yes, just as I said the first season was great, they mix the horror with politics and many clans vying for power.This continues in the 2nd season but the stake got much higher and the story more interesting.
Sometimes it surpasses any of the Hollywood movies and even in a tv series it was much more enjoyable."
6882,Kingdom,"How often do you watch something and there's not one thing you'd change? The casting is fantastic. A stellar cast. Nobody is in the wrong role, playing a part above their talents. It's fast paced, but still managed to bring depth to the characters. Kingdom isn't just a zombie series, there's social commentary there, politics. This series needs to win every award going, it really does.I cannot wait for series 3. Just phenomenal."
6883,Kingdom,"The best thing bout the series is, it's fucking fantastic!"
6884,Kingdom,Just finished Season 2 and absolutely cannot wait for the next one to come out already. No spoilers from me here but I highly recommend this to watch for anyone.
6885,Kingdom,Super intense! This is the best korean zombie drama!! Cant wait for season 3!
6886,Kingdom,👏 I ALWAYS say that koreans are good actors but sheesh their acting gives you goosebumps i loved it so much it's very fast paced which i like in shows cause I hate it when they drag it for so long for no reason but this show I finished this show in 2days because it's that good I just couldn't sleep without thinking about it so I wall like let me just finish it 😁 definitely worth watch loved it veryyyy muchhhh
6887,Kingdom,"Good story many well defined characters excellent details in props and sets
Zombie move that sets the benchmark."
6888,Kingdom,"A brilliant Korean series with captivating story telling. If you don't like zombies, just watch this series for the sheer excellence of it. The set, costumes and traditional warcraft are amazing. Korean cinema is going to new heights. Keep up this entertainment."
6889,Kingdom,"I finally got to sit down and watch this from start to finish and all I can really say is this shoe is everything walking dead wished it was. Firstly the setting creates a fear of the ""monsters"". No machine guns. No rocket launchers. Just single shot muskets and samurai swords. Every episode has enough wow moments to make you care about the world and is so well filmed and scripted I forgot I was watching a TV show. It's one of the best TV series I have ever seen."
6890,Kingdom,"Seriously, it started all so well but nothing in season 2 makes any sense: the main bad guy gets bitten in the face but doesn't turn into a monster unlike all the other zombies. The medicine girl somehow discovers water is the cure but won't tell the king-wannabe when the monsters were spreading inside the palace. Lastly, the king wannabe without knowing the zombies are afraid of water lures all the zombies to the pond. All zombies then went into pause mode to let this gUy break a little hole in the iced pond and the whole pond collapses. You're right. The last part where he gives away his kingdom to the kid, that was the last straw of how bad this series truly is. He believes that a baby can lead the country better than him. I mean, seriously?? This series is so anticlimactic, I'm so disappointed. Still giving it a score of 3 for the special effects."
6891,Kingdom,"I have seen most of zombie movies/series (as a fan of zombies genre) i even watch those cheap and disappointing shows sometimes i even laugh at them. so far there are only few who made it to my best list.
and the ""kingdom is one of them"".tension rising, intense battle, hair rising scenes, preparation/waiting for slaughter horde, no exaggerations! its worth your time watching.i will even pay more dollars just to watch more episodes of this show. hoping they earn more to create more!"
6892,Kingdom,"Kingdom is one of the best shows I've ever seen. Fantastic mix of horror, action, drama, and political intrigue. A lot of the camera work is *chef's kiss* magnifique as well. 9/10 check it out if you like being entertained."
6893,Kingdom,The acting is great by everyone. The cinematography is also great. The whole production is great. My only gripe is some of the costumes and perhaps how the zombies behave sometimes. These are very minor issues however.
6894,Kingdom,"So this series came as a bit of a surprise for me, but nevertheless, I looked forward to seeing it, and I was not dissapointed. First of all, the production and costume design is beautiful and the cinematography had me happily surprised. Acting and writing were great and overall, this series has very few flaws. As for the story: don't expect a horror series with zombies all over the place, but a well thought-out, not too complex historical drama which the zombies are just an aspect of. And believe me when I tell you: after finishing it, you'll want to see more."
6895,Kingdom,"This show is gripping right from the beginning, like game of thrones meet zombies, I love it!"
6896,Kingdom,"This series is really well done very gripping from the get go and has you binging the series in a weekend, although i thoroughly enjoyed the first season and the most part of the second season, i think they should have stayed with only two seasons as it feels like it would be dragging it out by making another one"
6897,Kingdom,This is a show that takes place hundreds of years back during the time of dynasties set in Korea amd id spoil it if i said much but it takes a very intresting twist on the genre of zombies! Awesome tense show that doesnt hold back on shock factor i love it! Also check out the film Train to Busan though very different setting ots a great film.
6898,Kingdom,"Very well directed and lovely piece of work
Acting was superb"
6899,Kingdom,"Great characters, intrigue and cinematography. Can't wait for the next season."
6900,Kingdom,"Political intrigue, likeable characters, exquisite costume design, action, horror, and comedy... port everything you understand about the multi layers of great Korian cinema and apply it to a TV show. The size and scale of this production is unlike anything I have ever seen for TV save for Game of Thrones and or Vikings. This show is the walking dead we deserve. I highly recommend anyone to at least give it a try."
6901,Kingdom,"Do we need more Zombies on TV? On this showing, yes we do. Great acting, clever plot, beautiful scenery, and when darkness comes, genuinley scary. Watch, and enjoy."
6902,Kingdom,"If you liked any of those shows above, then this show is them put together. This is a must watch!!"
6903,Kingdom,This one is like a zombie apocalypse meets kung fu meets some kind of classical tragedy. The zombie thing provides some excitement. If felt I was watching an old school kung fu flick complete with overacting and an old world exemplary benevolence vs evil incarnate. This always puts the lead characters in endless tragic circumstances. Not my taste but clearly a the ratings show a lot of people like this kind of stuff.
6904,Kingdom,"To those of you saying this is not better than walking dead and bleh bleh
Stop comparing you will never enjoy good dramas if you keep doing that.
For people complaining this had lot of bloodshed and unnecessary funny moments - you guys have to watch something else it's definitely not for you.
People saying that lot of Koreans are giving fake 10/10 reviews 😂 Thats funny because I really enjoyed this show. I'm not from Korean but I do have a thing for Korean Periodic dramas.
Since I've watched a lot of periodic dramas I've compared it a lil with them but I still say this one is on top of my list
The costumes are so beautiful.
I loved this drama for various reasons
Although the pace was slow initially it went according to the plot and everything was so perfect till the end.
All the actors from veterans to kids to the protogonists did their part well.
I can't stop admiring Ji Hoon- he's incredible from the start till the end. I like the way they portrayed his character development throught these six episodes from being a coward to being a leader, crown prince people root for.
Secondly Bae Doona and Seung Ryong - there's no doubt these two would be great by default just doing their thing.
The direction, cinematography, the script - every element is so strong and you'll start developing feelings for these characters.
You feel like you're a part of this show
*I guess I'm exaggerating*
Also the ending makes us realise that this is just a start.
Normally I'd predict everything that would happen but here I barely had time to even think of that ending.
I never really write reviews but few stupid reviews triggered me
From episode 1-6 you'll stay put in the same place and you won't get up untill you've watched till the episode 6.This happend to me!!!
* also get ready to die out of curiosity because season 2 won't be coming out any time soon*
I do understand that this drama is not for everyone watch it only of you'll accept their traditional aspects and only if you like zombie genre."
6905,Kingdom,"I had great experience to loving this show is amazing. there is no moment in it your felt like interest is gone. it full of entertainment, intersting things,curosity. i really apprreciated those all actors who play the role of very intersting way. it looks like has been real in life. i am so greatful to see it."
6906,Kingdom,"It keeps you going, that's for sure!
Wish all seasons are all there. Can't wait to season 2.
Fantastic plot and story beautifully done!"
6907,Kingdom,"Zombies are secondary, Political Twists are primary, A must watch, this series will bind you from first episode of season 1, will never let you go away until final episode of season 2, Full Political Horror."
6908,Kingdom,"This show blew my mind. Every episode is intense and wasted no time on unnecessary drama. The actings, customs and settings are done exceptionally well."
6909,Kingdom,"Best zoombie show i had ever seen
you can find anything in this series
horror, suspense, thriller, drama, action etc
one word ALL IN ONE"
6910,Kingdom,"This is one of the most unique, beautiful, terrifying, and fun experiences I've had while watching something on TV. Truly a masterpiece"
6911,Kingdom,"The way it has been portrayed is damn good, better than so many Hollywood movies and the characters are doing only what they must do they don't act boring and the twists binds the story to it's viewers.They've even maintained decency by not adding unwanted scenes that cannot be suited for kids.So it's a great series if you're looking for a zombie or a thriller series.Must watch."
6912,Kingdom,As I accepted Koreans directors have a great sense in zombie series aur movies nobody can match their level in making of zombies genre this series was much more than I accepted from it.
6913,Kingdom,"I don't watch Korean dramas but I do love the horror genre. After a friend recommended this to me, I decided to give it a go. First episode was a little slow but essential as they need to introduce the characters. It gets better as I continue watching the subsequent ones. The props, costumes are all very detailed. I've just finished season 1 with a twist that I didn't see coming. Gonna start season 2 tonight. Can't wait for season 3 in July."
6914,Kingdom,"It's hardly a secret that the zombie genre is a dried out well proven by western releases fighting to be the most boring and generic junk out there. Then to my pleasant surprise South Korea dishes up a series set in a Korean dynastic kingdom in 1897 where a crown prince tries to save his land from the horror. And it does it well. Good acting, believable costumes, lovely cinematic and the monsters blends into a wonderful time that makes this series worth your time. One more thing VFX could be done Better if they Want to."
6915,Kingdom,The plot is so unpredictable and nice... the characters are so smart to solve the problem with the sciences so the whole story makes sense and worth to watch.
6916,Kingdom,"Did not expect much but season 1 kept us going and we felt well entertained. The ending of season 1 was a huge cliffhanger, something I don't like.
And then.. season 2 started. And it felt like a turbo boost and the series went from ""nice!"" to ""woah!""Unique setting, intrigues, slashing, drama. Everything is in it and it felt SO much better and more energized then the (these days and imho) shallow TWD.Can't wait for more!"
6917,Kingdom,"This one is a must see. Everything about this is much better than usual Hollywood crap, the atmosphere, costimography, story, acting... I really enjoyed watching a tv show that doesnt contain the usual dose of forced special effects, forced audio buildups, stupid drama...this one is just awesome, love it!"
6918,Kingdom,"As my title suggested I am amazed at the successful combination of different genres so to speak. It was a really fresh idea to place zombies during the Korean middle ages(Joseon era) a direct contrast to most zombie films we see today, located at the modern urban landscape. The decision to do that breaths new life to the so far tired zombie genre.Moreover, what I found incredibly interesting is the ""subtle"" commentary on the extremely hierarchical korean society, which is the actual disease that has consumed the nation. Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient 0) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.Btw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!In terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning! Amazing cinematography, directing, costumes, locations, action scenes, it is truly impecable.What I would like to see is stronger female characters as the series is very male dominated.Good job to everyone involved and can't wait for the second season!!"
6919,Kingdom,Koreans are really did it with the netflix . I am the one of the zombie apocalypse lovers and last few years this kind of genre didn't go well of course . But the Kingdom did it to the next level with the really good atmosphere and late of 1800's Korea + Race for the throne will make it sooo dramatic . Don't be bother try it .
6920,Kingdom,"Probably The best Production of all Asian TV series. amazing grading, perfect angels, beautiful settings. It remind me of Game of Thrones, very similar feeling. The main character is killing White walkers(here are the zombies), finding the night king (here is the dead king), then going after Cerci (the queen).S1E01 is very slowly building up the vibe and story. It brought my interest, but after the speed is going faster and faster. Many things didn't explain properly. S2 things going out of control, storyline going way too fast. Stories becoming ridiculous. Important people die way too easy. The last episode was very disappointing. It ruined the entire show. They could have done better with such great production, what a pity!"
6921,Kingdom,"This is a brilliant piece of TV, well done Netflix! I only hope that theres much more of this commissioned."
6922,Kingdom,Story casting shhoting technique casting costumes 10 out of 10
6923,Kingdom,"This series shows how good of writers (and of course, actors) for a series. Every details are well connected and reasonable. The speed of the series are fast so you will enjoy every moment of it. They, Korean film crews and Netflix, did it again. Very enjoyable."
6924,Kingdom,"As many others, I too waited in anticipation for Season 2, and boy did it deliver! Season 2 has all the good things from Season 1 - the super powerful Dowager Empress, Doona Bae's versatility, all the politics of governing an ancient Kingdom. With all these Season 2 brings MORE zombie action, more fight-scenes, more of Doona Bae's propensity to seemingly take central role in whatever production she stars in, and more drama generally. Season 2 appears polished, refined and the production team sure knew what the audience wanted, and how to give it to them. The cast and acting is amazing, the cinematography and use of landscapes is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing. And for once, the zombies are actually terrifying!"
6925,Kingdom,A zombie series with high budget?? Those swords slashing through zombies look so realistic! All the zombie really looked like zombies??! Not just cheap make-up like most other zombie series or movies. Zombies who can really chase you for your blood?? Finally a story where its not an apocalypse. I certainly loved it.
6926,Kingdom,Thank you for this series it was an amazing experience to watch it! Well done
6927,Kingdom,Pls tell me this series is coming back for season 3 and so on! Special effects acting and story all blends in perfectly! Im a big zombie movie fanatic and this hit the spot! Havent seen a good zombie series/movie in like forever...Need more of this!
6928,Kingdom,Ive watched season 1 &2 multiple times! Waiting anxiously for season3... If netflix doesn't sign them up for season 3 I may just cancel my subscription.
6929,Kingdom,"I really love this drama. Acting ,storyline, VFX everything is just awesome."
6930,Kingdom,Too many plot holes. The story is too weak. Bad acting. And no substance. Zombie mechanics are so confusing... sometimes they die sometimes they won't.
6931,Kingdom,Powerfull 10/10 You Should Watch Once In Your Life .Bow Down To Directors & Actors🌪
6932,Kingdom,"Best zombie tv series ever, great pace keeps you hooked, forget the walking dead, this show is astonishing !!!!"
6933,Kingdom,"Characters are well-played
Effects are beyond imagination.
Lead lead actors and actresses are very effective in drama.
Cinematography is excellent.
All plot is heart pounding and exciting! I am so thrilled.
I had already finished the 6 episodes without break! This is so called addiction at its finest!10/10 - I would say this series is a combination of, "" Train to Busan, Walking Dead, Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo, Warm Bodies and World War Z!Thanks to Netflix for this wonderful and incredible series. Looking forward to season 2."
6934,Kingdom,"Either you're into K-Pop or not, you must watch this series. A basic theme about royal's life and intrigues from powerful people that are wrapped with Korean's great history and their moral values. The writer itself known as one of Korea's talented writers, especially for criminal-theme TV drama in Korea; some of her works considered as favorite dramas both in Korea and other countries. I do really appreciate the cinematography: reminds me a lot about Hollywood's war-theme TV series, especially the tone dark that they used (it didn't picture so much ""happy, sunny day"" scene, which made the scary-and-impossible war got stronger). I enjoyed so much its storyline, even though in some minor parts, in my opinion, are too easy to be read or guessed, but it did not matter a lot to the main storyline. In the end, I think their final scene reminds me about something similar in the closing scene of the latest season of GoT: the deads are ready to destroy human presence. I really am looking forward to Season 2.Note: DO NOT WATCH THIS WHILE EATING ANYTHING."
6935,Kingdom,"Brilliant picture, wonderful structured storyline. So refreshing. The first korean production that was brought to my attention and I loved everything about it."
6936,Kingdom,"I sat down to only watch 1 episode as it looked entertaining, and the next thing I know I have binge watched the entire 1st season. I enjoy a zombie movie but only if its made well and VERY rarely are they, however this was beyond good. The geographical locations even at their grittiest are beautiful, serene and yet terrifying in the knowledge of what is right around the corner hidden away. The plot is superb and brings the whole season to a finger gripping on the edge of your seat, breathless ending...where your wondering?? Is Netflix bringing this series back? I hope so, for an enthusiast who loves this type of film, series..this is top notch and deserves to be delved into deeper! If I had more than 2 thumbs they would all be up!"
6937,Kingdom,"Loved it. It kept me guessing and there was not a single moment where I thought to myself ""eh, wonder if I can find something better"", which is saying a lot for my ADHD viewing style. I love the time and place it is set in. There is a lot to like here. I am excited for season 2 and hope it holds up to season 1"
6938,Kingdom,This show is great - shot with the highest production values and acted pretty perfectly. Add to that not only the period drama which is well done and of course the zombie scenario and if this sounds appealing to you you'll be in heaven. If none of that appeals to you then I don't know why you'd be on IMDb!
6939,Kingdom,What a nice series clean no sex no nude great storyThats how to make a showRomanticHorrorActionHistoricalZombies
6940,Kingdom,"Great acting, script and cinematography. It's not a secret that zombie stories are all dried out, however, this Korean thriller is amazing! Original and interesting story, I love how they blended zombies and the joseon era."
6941,Kingdom,I love a good zombie flick and this series exceeded my expectations. I didn't think it was going to be so great! The storyline was so much deeper than your average zombie outbreak. I'm patiently waiting for season 2!!!
6942,Kingdom,"A zombie series worth commenting on, let's get started! At first I really did had to psych myself out to watch it I'm not a big fan of voice over I rather read the subtitles but this is decent voice over work, nicely done. Next the story line is simply.. amazing plot with actual origins of the outbreak not some chemical warfare. Martial arts with gore and sword fights, just couldn't ask for more; zombies that keep on coming never slowing down. I'm going to stop it here but please watch the series and be amazed"
6943,Kingdom,The mix of zombie and Korean jaseon period after the invasion of Japan is just so unique and different from the modern clique zombie movies. Everyone should watch this! Great story
6944,Kingdom,"This series is great although, the one negative is the English dubbing / translations. I am confident that the Korean version isn't as silly or infantile as the translations would have you believe. In fact, the story and acting are enough to help you overlook the Anglo-slaughter of the dubbed version. I liked Ju Ji-Hoon's performance so much I googled him to see what else he was in so I could check them out.The reason for 7/10 is because there are a few moments throughout the seasons where the characters would have to be willingly stupid in order to not draw a straight line between what they've learned and uncovering secrets. I don't think a person of average intelligence wouldn't clue in to some things that characters in the show seem baffled by; again, this could be simply the result of poor translation, but that's the experience I had so it was hard not to be influenced by it.All in all, I am hopeful for future seasons and to see what happens to the Kingdom going forward."
6945,Kingdom,This is best zombie show is k drama history.i its so fantastic.and more cool.i waiting this for s3
6946,Kingdom,"Deserves more Public attention...most underrated show till now...must watch if you are into horror and story...the cinematography is top notch, finely directed and well castes."
6947,Kingdom,Storyline is awesome. Acting is best. If you are a fan Game of thrones then Definitely go for it
6948,Kingdom,"South korea u are amazing 🇰🇷 ..WOW ...... i mean this wonderful tv series apart from the masterpiece zombie story tells us about the traditional korean culture thier traditional clothing , architect .
It's so entertaining and well done that i wanted to experience that thrill in my life 😂.. it's full of Action , drama , thrill , emotion , wisdom, everything.. it's A dish worth every single penny.. and one thing i want to tell u is that u will get same thrill , emotion and action in every single episode ... This series isn't going to waste ur precious time .🇮🇳👍
Note: it's a zombie series so might not want to eat something while watching 😂😂"
6949,Kingdom,Its not just good in zombie genre but...but this shows also tell us about politics for throne ....literally I haven't seen this type of content in my entire life. You should also start watching it.....seriously you'll gonna enjoy it.....
6950,Kingdom,OMG this series is everything. It has all elements which is required to make series worth watching. If you are like umm I don't want to read subtitles then buddy you are missing everything. When it come to zombie movies and series Korean have ace it.
6951,Kingdom,"So there are alot of Zombie movies and series out there. We already know what potentially the way of dealing with them... alot of Amos, food in the shelves, just make sure not to make alot of noise, hide in the basement or somewhere made of impenetrable steel and you are good to survive.But the question here is ... what if the zombies happen during those age, when we live in bamboo houses where there is no padlocks and can easily shatter?This series, Kingdom gave us this thrill. How the stories build episode by episode and the smart way of attacking each and every problems that comes along the way. Kingdom is a brilliant series.I am personally not a fan of Zombie movie or series, but Kingdom made me wanting for more. Season 2 is Another level of season 1. Didnt disappoint. The way how the writers reveal some of the secrets in every episodes is so amazing...Highly recommended."
6952,Kingdom,"Nothing! I didn't regret watching the whole seasons and special episode to be honest. It's worth watching. And if you like zombie tropes series, do not ever miss to watching this.Season 1,
Plot: 8.5/10
Twists: 8.5/10
Character: 9/10
Rating: 9/10Season 2,
Plot: 9/10
Twists: 10/10
Character: 10/10
Rating: 10/10As you can notice, as eps passed, it's getting much better than the previous episodes. The hidden truth will be revealed. The execution of the twist is worth watching. Didn't even regret watching this series. It will raise your standard when it comes to kdrama zombie tropes series.Do not forget to watch the prequel of this series after. It might answer those questions that was unanswered. Thanks you for your hard work for creating this such good series! Salute!"
6953,Kingdom,"The idea of political intrigue + zombies in feudal Korea sounds interesting. However the characters have no depth, plus the story and the plot holes make you roll your eyes all too often. Often the characters are not driven by their own motivations but the writer just pushes the characters in the plot further, dragging the whole ensemble on a rail. The acting in itself is not terrible but it's hard to deliver a nuanced performance when the characters are so 2 dimensional. Really disappointing. Kudos to the cinematography though."
6954,Kingdom,I waited for a long time for this one and boy it didnt disappoint..great show
6955,Kingdom,I wasn't sure if I would like the show when I first come across it but once I started to watch it I'm glad I did. I like how they changed the way they done Zombies and not make them the same way as other tv shows or movies I find they really suit the time period it is set in. I do have one problem with it is that there is only 8 episodes and I watched all of them in a day now I want more. Since the start of the year I've been finding a couple of shows from Netflix that are good but only have one season in it so far they really need more episodes for all of them
6956,Kingdom,"I hate TWD for sure, and i hate zombie movies and stuff.First of all, i want to watch it because it has my bae, ji-hoon. But then, i was captivated by whole script, acting, cinematography, etc.It has brilliant twists and i think the scenario is genius.Love it!"
6957,Kingdom,"Short review. This is a very well made, mixed genre zombie show that's filled with clever writing, camerawork, and set in an interesting time period. It's funny, it's scary, it's epic..and it's not predictable at all. Watch this show. End of my first review."
6958,Kingdom,Such a great series. Koreans are really good at cliff hangers and I really cant wait for the next season. What's impressive is that it has surpring twists like no other series. It is definitely a must watch!
6959,Kingdom,"It's hard to memorize the name at first, so you better write it down on a piece of paper. it has a good concept of zombie apocalypse despite some flaws. the politics resemble of game of thrones. we're rooting for the main character to prevail, and then plot twist. i think it's best if the series ends in season 2, but they make another story of it."
6960,Kingdom,"After watch it without read synopsis I'm not expecting this series at all but it blow me away after watch it just for 10 minutes,
the cinematography is astonishing and perfect. I have to admit that this kind of setting and cinematography is not tv series class, this have to be high class movie.
trust me, after you watch this for just one episode, you'll agree with me that zombie blockbuster movie hollywood should shame after this series.I like this story more than TWD, the acting, thrilling, horror is more intense in this series and more logical than you think
I think this series will change your perspective with korean drama,
this is just to good, cant wait for season 3 got release"
6961,Kingdom,"Overall it's a worthy binge watching series, it's just that the Prince character you'd find is not realistic (you'll know when you hit season 2). The other odd thing is, Seo-bi can avoid the zombies with a single fireball but all the soldiers just died at the end even when they know that the zombies are afraid of fire. Just doesn't make sense to me."
6962,Kingdom,"Really thank you netflix! The Best zombie series ive ever seen! Fights, storyline, everything. I just dropped my brain after last 2 episodes."
6963,Kingdom,"I'm mid-4th episode in and this is easily the best contemporary zombie film I've ever seen. Love the costumes, the heroes, the machinations in the palace, the zombie chase scenes that have me screaming ""RUN!! RUN!!"" from the sofa...whew! I'm not sure we need 6 episodes, but I'm waiting eagerly for the villians to get their come-uppance."
6964,Kingdom,"What do you expected from a corean historical zombie movie? I don't know, but I was suprised. Six episodes later you will be left alone, with some kind of cliff hanger. But this is fine there is more great thrilling story telling to come. Can't wait!"
6965,Kingdom,"Great story and much action with a big budget. Season 1 was better and more interesting I would give it a 10/10 but season 2 was still superb but not as good.
The action in the show is really well done and the zombies are very scary looking and extremely convincing. You will start to care about the characters a lot but this was hampered due to waiting for so long for season 2 that you forget the story so everything was way more confusing because they didn't include any recap.
I think eason 3 will be the best after that ending I can't wait. Please watch this show its easily the best zombie show ever made. Much better than american"
6966,Kingdom,"The Kingdom shows us this is the best quality zombie related movie. Scenes, production, screens are awesome! 10/10"
6967,Kingdom,"I truly can't breathe while watching the last episode, very thrilling and intimidating, please watch it for the good of story and mistery. Gonna update this review after the new season release."
6968,Kingdom,Casually brings the zombie genre back to life. A must see for any one that loves the biters!
6969,Kingdom,"... spoiled it for me completely. First episode was promising, the second instantly spoiled it. The sense of humour like in a Jackie Chan movie is a disaster. Sorry. Good idea, but why make a soap out of it??"
6970,Kingdom,"I need a season 3. I really enjoy this series, can't wait for another one.One of the best zombie I even seen!"
6971,Kingdom,"""Kingdom"" is a well done series with characteristically Eastern production. The sets are well made, the scenery is beautiful, the soundtrack is compelling and the action is fierce. The acting, of course, is melodramatic as usual, but while fans of campy Chinese Kung Fu movies (yes, I know this is Korean) will not find anything unusual about grown men behaving like injured, hysterical children in response to any hint of tension, viewers unaccustomed to Eastern melodrama will be repulsed. I like this series because I like Eastern action movies and zombies, but people who do not like either will not like this show. It has plenty of blood and gore so not recommended for young children."
6972,Kingdom,I never write a review in Imdb or other sites but this one wouldn't allow me not to write ... the show is so underrated just because it's Korean .... well about show I can say S1 was good but S2.... wow I mean WOW! it's way better than the 1st one it has more and more surprises especially the 2 last episodes of it ! There are moments that you say okay that's it the show is getting slow and boring and there's no way to escape! But the writer(s) surprise(s) and you are like wowwww! Gosh!My heart's beating my face ! .... overall this Show's definitely watchworthy ❤
6973,Kingdom,"Great story - politics, war, relationships, humorCompelling characters - strong femaleSuspenseful and funny scenes, with entertaining dialogue and surprising eventsTRUE horror elements including dread, fear of the unknown, impending doom, truly shocking scary scenes, taboo breaking & gruesome events (like mom zombies & kids). I will leave it to your imagination.Multilayered plot / build up to epic battle of human vs zombies and humans vs humans (political war for control of kingdim)SCARY ZOMBIES - Fast, Gory, IntenseNo one is safe"
6974,Kingdom,When you can't tell which season was better then... Waiting for season 3 and hoping they will keep high standards
6975,Kingdom,"Great storyline, awesome heroes, terror galore and a bloody gore-fest too. Kingdom is probably been the best thing released on Netflix this year... so far. What begins as a political drama soon turns into a supernatural thriller... in the best way possible. The first episode is a LITTLE bit slow but give it 'til the end of pilot and you'll be left wanting more. The cinematography is very well done too... if that matters to you, Mr/Miss Reader."
6976,Kingdom,"It is like a mix up of game of thrones and waking dead with korean film making..
This is really good series if you want to spend some time without realizing that you are wasting it"
6977,Kingdom,"An epic historical thriller and a must match Series.
Asians have raised the standards quite high.
Brilliant acting and wonderful locations. A new fan of the Korean Series. Thanks to all who made this series. Waiting eagerly for the next season."
6978,Kingdom,What a twist in the last episode. The show gets very furious from episode 3.Definitely worth watching.
6979,Kingdom,"My expectations is a little bit low before watching this show. Just Zombie show which has no plot and typical violence.
But after watching 2 episodes, I was crazy in this show.
Recently I never completed tv show Episode when I started to watch but I finished all 6 episode without any stop.
I don't know how I can wait season2."
6980,Kingdom,"To be honest I'm only at the first episode yet, but this mix of politics, conspiring, twists and zombies is just so entertaining."
6981,Kingdom,"This drama had me hooked from beginning to end. like reading a good book. Historical drama meets the walking dead. All the elements I love, little romance, lots of tense and thrilling moments, great characters, immersion in the details of the authentic culture of the era - costumes, food social and economic values, love it, cant wait for season two. Please let it come soon."
6982,Kingdom,The storyline is amazing how the zombies began and how the every one fight for the crown in any way possible
6983,Kingdom,"I am so impressed by the intensity of acting in this tale that the zombies are, actually, entertaining. The entire first season kept my interest. I'm looking forward to the second season, hoping that the story comes to an equally satisfying end. Thanks, Netflix!"
6984,Kingdom,"Just wanna note that Kingdom is likely set back somewhere in year 1600, which is right after a 7-year war with Japan. Joseon, the name of Korea at the time, enjoyed 150 years of peace and prosperity but started to disintegrate as power game between political parties became intense and the monarch was losing control. Meanwhile, Japan was at unification and finally launched a surprise attack in 1592, which led to the Imjin war of 7 years btw Korea and Japan. During wartime, the crown prince Gwanghaegun, likely the model of Lee Chang in Kingdom, led civilians and soldiers to battle while his father and royalty fled to north. You will get to know the truth in Season 2, and how the zombies got started, but I won't mention further cuz it'd be a spoiler."
6985,Kingdom,Awsm story telling with brilliant action...and also casting was so good... real intense scene with zombie world.
6986,Kingdom,"I was very skeptical of this show in the early episodes, even though I have had strong recommendations from my trusted friends to watch this show. While I will say that the ending is a final blow in getting me hooked into this show (to see how season 2 continues this), I can agree that there are elements such as the humor from the aristocrat fools don't really work for me other than that they do in a way continue the plot (thin sheet from they are there for the sake of the plot), however this show unpacks in a way that makes it have great potential. In season 1 currently many things are still astray (just details here and there that are waiting to be used later). I will need to see how season 2 fares before I will gasp the true worth of this show. Right now its a bit on how Game of Thrones should've dealt with the frost walkers (with their own mix of talent) but ill have to see."
6987,Kingdom,"A beautiful, under-appreciated show with wonderful performances, breathtaking photography and a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is a bit of a slow burn at first, but completely worth it."
6988,Kingdom,"KINGDOM SEASON 2 VERDICT:
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIMEWhile season 1 was a great run, many are extremely disappointed with this highly anticipated sequel:
terribly slow pace, too much talkingfocused on political power struggle and drama with highly guessable plotswhere the fvck are the zombies????!!!!Looks like another TV series forced to finish deadlines in less than a year. Ended up producing a boring, pseudo-zombie show. Quite a mediocre season at best. Not worth wasting 6 hours of your life. Terrible!To those who've watched, were there any exciting moments worth remembering at all?"
6989,Kingdom,"I love the originality of this show! The actors, story line, and settings are pretty great! I especially love Seo Bi, Moo-Young,Prince Cho, and Shin. Even Beom-Pal starts to grow on you as you continuously root for him to become a more courageous person throughout the series. I think season 2 is even better than the first season, and I can't wait to see what season 3 holds. I love this show. Please don't cancel it Netflix! It is just a refreshing, original show. Well one Kingdom."
6990,Kingdom,"I'm not usually watch Korean movie or tv show but Kingsom is so cool that I have to watch it twice, can't wait for season 2."
6991,Kingdom,Excitement for the series will exponentially increase .
6992,Kingdom,"An absolute gem on Netflix.
One of the best thriller web series I have seen. The most unique and creative period shows on offer."
6993,Kingdom,"An integrated masterpiece that brings your view back to the works of the zombies again, representing, directing and embodying the story by mixing historical political events with the idea of the zombies, even if it was a date of excellence .. Wonderful work, all we lack is dialogues because the dialogues in it were somewhat superficial."
6994,Kingdom,"Hands down the best zombie series out there! From cinematography to setting, plot to battles, political intrigue to twists, costume design to acting, this easily puts all other similar series to shame. The quality of each episode makes you want more and more and you end up binge watching the whole thing like there was no tomorrow. Definitely a must watch and trust me, you'll do it more than once!"
6995,Kingdom,This series is very good and very enjoyable. Actors have payed their role very well. Waiting for it's third season. Hope Netflix release it soon.
6996,Kingdom,"I didn't find any flaws in this drama. Story line and player acting are neat and classy. I really enjoyed the best zombie show ever. and not only that, in terms of conflict this drama manages to present great greed, cruelty and selfishness. the acting of all the players is very good and heavy. all players get the right portion of duration. the writer and director managed to portray this drama very well. the beauty of this drama managed to be presented beautifully. therefore I dare to give a rating of 10. Recomended!"
6997,Kingdom,Simply amazing zombie series .. must watch if you are zombie addict..
6998,Kingdom,Each episode is gripping with a well thought out plot.
6999,Kingdom,"I've been raving about this show to anyone who will listen for a while now! With a winning combination of zombies, politics and period drama, this show feels very fresh and certainly lives up to the hype. Perfectly cast and acted, impeccably produced and with some of the best action scenes in a show for a long while. Definitely one of the best additions to the genre, and well worth adding to your watch list."
7000,Kingdom,"I am glad that I came across this series on ! Old traditions, thriller, Politics, Zombies and lot more, must watch series of you are a fan of chinese movie fan..."
7001,Kingdom,"Everything about this show is brilliant. Like others have said, it seamed strange setting it in this era but my god they got it spot on. The English dubbing is as good as you'll ever get and after the first episode you would almost think it was the original spoken language.
The cinematic experience is on a par with the best of Hollywood when needed, and the attention to detail in the palace's and costumes is second to none.
I used to watch the walking dead but the zombies became so slow and boring that I gave up on it. The zombies here are on a par with World War Z and then some, and just to make it more interesting they are also ever so slightly evolving through the show.
In a nutshell... Its one of / if not the best zombie series I've ever seen and cannot wait for season 3."
7002,Kingdom,"Interesting only because of the location and era. Acting is sub par, story is slow. I was so excited for this, but I'm disappointed."
7003,Kingdom,"To be honest I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this but I found what can only be described as a true hidden gem! Excellent writing, acting, cinematography and fight choreography. I can't praise this enough to do justice to just how good it is."
7004,Kingdom,"Season 1 was very good but season 2 is great.
the best Zombie i ever seen and the whole story about kingdom and the flower ..i love it.
the cast are incredibly good."
7005,Kingdom,"I don't want to discuss the specifics to avoid spoilers, but although it started rather promising in the 1st Season, in the 2nd Season I strongly disliked some of the plot twists, reactions and consequences as the film was evolving. Compassion and everything is pretty nice, but when they appear too contradicting to potential reality it starts feeling too detached and at times even painful to follow. I had to stop myself from fast forwarding some episodes of the 2nd season, and it never happened to me in the 1st season. So yes, this is a bit disappointed, but I still like the show because of the setting and the underlying idea."
7006,Kingdom,"I was recommended to watch this just 3 days ago. I finished the entire season by now and can't wait for the 3rd season. The story line, pace, BGM, cinematography, characters and everything else is just awesome. I can only recommend to watch without hesitation. Netflix should produce contents from all over the world like this story line."
7007,Kingdom,"I think we should move to watching Korean series, it's my first one and I'm highly impressed the way they showcase different genres and stories in a single series. I stopped watching walking dead after fifth season due to the narcissism nature of the lead character RICK but I guess I've found getter version of walking dead. Give it a try and you will be addicted to it."
7008,Kingdom,"Zombies are just a detail of good written deep story.Really a good show, hope there will be 3th season."
7009,Kingdom,"After a long and disappointing wait for All Of Us Are Dead, I am so happy to have discovered this show. I love the back story with all its plot twists and turns, and the unique take on zombies. I found it very original and refreshing. There is so much more to the story than the usual zombie attacks in every scene, with their endless bone cracking and growling noises. There were one or two scenes where I found the acting to be a bit overdone and cheesy, but season 2 is phenomenal! I really enjoyed the depth the characters have developed. I would highly recommend Kingdom to anyone who enjoys Korean cinema or zombie movies, but is looking for something more original."
7010,Kingdom,"Dubbing was as clean as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, few foreign films seem to get it right; however, the Kingdom did just that.It was a compelling story, the first episode was slow (character building), but when the action starts off it is intense. I was mesmerized by the action, production value of the show, costumes were exquisite, and over all performance of all the actors/actressesThey did an excellent job with character development, I was fully committed to each character and their arc hoping each one would survive.I keep hearing how the zombie franchise is a dried up well; however, for me it isn't dried up, writers are just failing to produce good quality movies/series. (In most categories) The Kingdom is not one of them, they threw some twist I hadn't expected and was extremely pleased with their interpretation of the genre.It is a series I highly recommend"
7011,Kingdom,Series that packs a punch with its thrilling plot line supported by amazing cast and direction.
7012,Kingdom,"I love everything about it. The story, the plot, the characters and everything. What's not to love?"
7013,Kingdom,"Late night, around 1AM I was just browsing thru Netflix and came across Kingdom, and I was just like hmm, this looks like a Period Korean Zombie show. I was super excited, once I started watching this, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It's so good, I rewatched all six episodes again! And 6 episodes per season isn't enough!!Season 2 need to come sooner!!! Totallly addicted!Anyone who loves zombie films need to watch this! Enough said, now go watch it!"
7014,Kingdom,"Good tv show,I hope will be a second season,I really enjoyed. The actors did a good job!!!"
7015,Kingdom,"I hattte zombie movies but this one was so well done i finished the whole first season in one seating lol!! Cant wait for the second season!!!!!
Ps. Someone wrote in the rieview tht the movie is too male dominated and would like to see some good female lead actor. If you felt that way than the director did a good job because that is how korea was in the old times. I know it's sad but in the old times in korea, they needed men to support family by farming, fighiting, fishing, etc so males were very precious. Almost to the point where if you have a girl pregnant it was a huge disappointment."
7016,Kingdom,"This show is amazing in many ways. It is estetically gorgeus, has got a great plot, good acting, and so on. But most of all, it speaks about our society more than one could believe: it is about migration, about the happy few exploiting a large mass of people in misery and in starvation, leaving them out of their lands again and again, as if they were just garbage. I think this is one of the best zombie thing of the last few years because it talks about now, truly folllowing Romero's path."
7017,Kingdom,"Awesome show, very intense and action packed. Characters are great! Defently a must see for zombie fans."
7018,Kingdom,"The series is two-level tense and awesome. The story of the crown prince against the usurpers of the throne and his survival while trying to save his people, and the second is the ravaging zombie disease destroying everything in its path. I really like the setting and love the way the disease was introduced. Great show. Looking forward to much more."
7019,Kingdom,"Absolutely amazing. I really love all of this show : the Asian culture and history, the zombies and everything related to it. Just to give to the zombie topic a whole new story."
7020,Kingdom,"This series reflect the actual autocratic society in which the ""so called"" elite will not only rule over the poor but also exploits their works and life. The kind of horrific plague shown here should occur time and again to remind that all people are equal and should have equal opportunity in the society to fight over hunger, poverty and epidemics."
7021,Kingdom,"Oh man! When I started it,I wasn't expecting it to be this good and am so badly looking forward to 2nd season.There is a story and gruesomeness,all in one show.Acting is superb and the gore is awesome.They left us hangin in the air,literally,in the last episode,and if you're reading the comments before starting to watch the show,go ahead,without a second thought."
7022,Kingdom,If u search Like 'got' series this is perfect.in got Dead snow here zombies excellent series.dint Miss.
7023,Kingdom,Excellent take on the zombie outbreak with the explanation of the disease. The show doesn't looses it's intense settings even for a moment. A must watch for everybody!
7024,Kingdom,"It's like watching GAME of THRONES and WALKING DEAD at the same time..
Binged watch the whole season just for one night and i must say all the scenes were amazing and makes you to look forward"
7025,Kingdom,"Best series I have ever watched. The action, the cinematography, the acting and of course zombies are the best show in these series. Looking forward to watch the season 3"
7026,Kingdom,Completely Better than any horror show out there. Better than resident evil a million times
7027,Kingdom,Great cast. Great acting. Absolutely great cinemathography. The scenario also perfect! The series absolutely worth my time.
7028,Kingdom,"Even after reading the many 10/10 reviews here I was not expecting this to be as good as it was. If you (like me) sometimes need a little push to watch non-Hollywood style productions that aren't in english, I can't emphasize enough how much it's worth it here.
Incredibly well made series with nothing lacking-to the contrary! I was on the edge of my seat for the entire 1st season and after one episode had completely forgotten that I was reading subtitles. Like another user put it nicely: Take notes Hollywood - this is how it's done."
7029,Kingdom,"Every frame in this series is a masterpiece! Loved the plot, story, characters and director's vision. While there is so many zombie based films and shows but this one is definitely the best. It shows a new perspective and a new way to show a zombie story. I hope there is a season three for this show. Can't wait.BTW, I saw the show like 7 times and never bored. Enjoyed every time.."
7030,Kingdom,"It is a mistake to categorize this as a zombie series. Instead this series is more of a power struggle to capture the throne with the zombie epidemic backdrop. Well done. The Game of Throne, a Korea version."
7031,Kingdom,"Wow. What a zombie-thriller series. I can't get out from this ""KINGDOM"". Literally every scene is wow moment . The kingdom crew worked so hard to make this perfect, I can see that. Kudos to the team. Zombie makeup and their performance are just perfect . No words to say , I'm impressed. If you like zombie movies , you should definitely check this out , it won't disappoint you. Just give me season 3, I can't wait!!!!!"
7032,Kingdom,Such a mindblowing series with a strong sturdy script. More than the zombie things we will be pocessed by the story and the actors. Twist and turns are portrayed in a subtle manner with out loosing the suspense. Actors performance are too great.
7033,Kingdom,Love this zombie flicks from start to finish for every episode. Can't wait for the second season. Bring it on
7034,Kingdom,"Inlove zombie movies. and i really enjoyed kingdom becuz its different, and not typical zombie movies. interesting and solid storylines. cant wait for season 2. it better come out soon."
7035,Kingdom,"This has to be by far the worst netflix series I've seen. Some characters act outside logic, the zombies should be called. ""Brainless vampires."" Because they act like vampires without thought. The zombies go days without eating but still manage to run faster than a normal well fed human, the magistrate has way too much power over the crown prince, and people seem to ignore the main threat at hand. All in all it was extremely boring to watch and i had to skip some scenes because they were unnecessary."
7036,Kingdom,"A real treat for zombie fans
the locations are very smartly selected
One of the first shows in zombie genre to take us back to the kings and queens era
Plot unfolds in very unique manner which doesn't let us take eyes off the screen even for a second
End of the Season ends with craving for more like a zombie"
7037,Kingdom,"The language, the setting, the atmosphere, the plot, the characters, it's all bloody perfect."
7038,Kingdom,"Best tv series from korea consist of drama, action, good acting made love with this and final episode suspense. This series feels like you are virtually in the series"
7039,Kingdom,"I don't normally write reviews on many tv programmes but this show was a must,I have only one word for it tremendous!"
7040,Kingdom,Must watch this it is so gripping and the unfolding of some secret are mind blowing.
7041,Kingdom,You will end this drama in one go. Over the night. That is for sure.
7042,Kingdom,Most expensive series. is watching this series more than 10 time.in my choice it's best series of South Korea.love form Bangladesh.thank you netflix
7043,Kingdom,"Saw something about this series a while back and was looking forward to seeing it. Have only watched the first 2 episodes so far, but wow, awesome, Can't wait to watch the rest."
7044,Kingdom,It has a slow pace but it still enjoyable to watch. The makeup and the overall CGI/practical effects are pretty good. There was a lot of character building but leaving some mystery to there back story.
7045,Kingdom,The story is a steady mid pace affair with some atypical Eastern archetypes done well with some attention to detail that put it above regular tv viewing. The court intrigues and formalities add tension while the action sequences are well done even if somewhat stereotypical.
7046,Kingdom,"Slow pace, to many dialogue, a bad plot story. Just like B rated 90s age movie"
7047,Kingdom,"On the heels of a myriad of other international series, Kingdom presents yet another hit for Netflix. It's a very unique and satisfying version of the zombie trope that truly immerses the viewer into the onscreen events."
7048,Kingdom,Game of Thrones but with cooler zombies. I really wasn't expecting to like this as much as i did.
7049,Kingdom,"Kingdom is a Horror suspense thriller....
But my only concern is about it's episodes..
WHY IS IT SOO FEW ONLY ""6""..!!!!!
At least 10 episodes must be done....
The thing is its not only about the zombie creature's but also about the nation and his crown prince protecting his people and gaining their belief....as HIS CROWN PRINCE"
7050,Kingdom,"I wish i could put in words and describe how good this show is, literally everything has been managed perfectly, the script is delightful there's 0% percent you could get bored at any moment watching this show the acting is stelar is pure and raw you get to connect with every each oke of the characters of the show and feel just like they, so many emotions for only one show oh and last but not least the camera work deserves all the awards they can get wtffffff im amazed by how good this i just still cannot describe it, this is simply a MASTERPIECE, hands down one the best tv shows I've ever seen."
7051,Kingdom,"The first ancient Korea Zombie Series I HAVE EVER SEEN, and it's pretty nice"
7052,Kingdom,"Don't let the fact this isn't in English put you off.Visually stunning. Brilliant story, well paced with genuinely ""edge of your seat"" action. in some places.Loved it. More please."
7053,Kingdom,"They truely have mastered the zombie genre. As a person who doesn't understand Korean, I still prefer Korean audio with English subtitles rather than dubbed. It just gives the show more character. Now I'm exited for the 3rd season and looking forward for ""All of Us Are Dead"" which is also Korean and comes 28th january."
7054,Kingdom,"I think the young prince kinda look like character ""RICK"" from series ""the walking dead"". i hope this series won't be boring such twd."
7055,Kingdom,"S show is just not a one dimensional zombie show, what's great about this show is it has various aspects and there are things which may come very surprising for you. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if your a fan of thriller shows mixed with political brilliance.."
7056,Kingdom,GREAT.I enjoyed the scenes. It feels very good.I feel like I am there I totally get into the scenes.Must Watch.You cannot miss it anyway.I want season 2 ASAP.
7057,Kingdom,I've been researching movies and their reviews for years on here but never felt inclined to leave a review until now! This movie is awesome! Although I speak English and decided to watch it dubbed rather than read the captions it didn't affect the movie at all. I love zombie shows and I'm constantly looking for my next zombie high and this my friends is it! It took until the 3rd episode to pick up speed but once it did it's been amazing! I've been on the edge of my seat smiling in terror the entire time!! If you have any doubt about watching this please leave the doubt behind and watch it because you will not be disappointed!!
7058,Kingdom,"I never writed a review on idbm before. But must write for this movie series, im big fan of horror movie so i dont feel any scary with any zombie movies, just because i watched alot of zombie movies already. But this series is different, very different, feel very dark and scary, humanity is weak to runing and fast spreading virus zombie :)
I think:
The walking dead: 8/10
Fear of the walking dead 5/10
Z nation: 4/10
This series: 10/10
You will not be dissapointed."
7059,Kingdom,"Best zombie series.I enjoyed every minutes, all episodes are awesome."
7060,Kingdom,"First and foremost, Netflix made a groundbreaking with the release of 'Kingdom', being its first Korean drama. I was aghast with the drama from the start of the first season until the end of season 2 final episode. It's an interesting series with great storyline, settings, and characters. It's been a while I watched a series that each episode will tempt me to see the one that follows. That actually happened again at the end of season 2 final episode, revealing more questions born out of curiosity and display of a new mystery character."
7061,Kingdom,Must watch great acting decent stroy plot twists and much much more
7062,Kingdom,Kingdom is worth seeing by generation upon generation...
7063,Kingdom,Wow! The both seasons are kingdom-nastic and kingdomazing...
7064,Kingdom,Omg love it and I hope they do season 3. I keep watching this drama over and again. Trust me I dont like zombie movie but this drama I love the twist and this better than walking dead and znation. Love this please keeping do this I cant wait to see season 3 on Netflix.
7065,Kingdom,Hope to see season 3 ASAP. Season 2 brings hype and excitement to me definitely. This drama is really a bait for drama freak like me. The drama has it moral values and highly recommended
7066,Kingdom,"Dear all iMDs ones, believe it's the most very extreme lovable series for the ones who really love horror adventure drama politics with a perfect chemistry. The Walking Dead has its own taste, but it's really so worth watching. Kindly go through its first Two episodes you'll get yourself bonded with it. 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼"
7067,Kingdom,I hope there will be a SEASON 3... so many questions to be answered after the last season.... best korean horror tv series of 2019👏👏👏😬
7068,Kingdom,Just crazy good production enjoyed every episode please renew the season. not your typical Hollywood TV show but the did really great on incoporating Asian culture and drama as well as politics
7069,Kingdom,Great mix of Korean medieval drama and a zombie apocalypse. Not gruesome.
7070,Kingdom,"This series is one of a kind especially it's a different genre from what we usually watch from Kdrama etc. My patience was worth it. Every episode gives you chills. Damn. I rarely finished those Kdrama, but this series makes me want to keep watching and anticipating for the next Season. I truly RECOMMEND KINGDOMS for you to watch. Though season 2 is out, now I have to wait for the next season again. T.T"
7071,Kingdom,"This web show was the best ever show I have watched in my whole life....It keeps you hooked up in its all 12 eps.....Do check it out if you haven't yet, you'll not regret it !!"
7072,Kingdom,"The best zombie series I have ever seen. I have rewatched it few times and everytime I appreciate more the cinematography. Everything is beautiful. Stories are excellent. As an Asian, I can strongly relate to the culture and its norms. What I like more from the Season 2 is the comic/manga-like vibe in the finale battle.
I really wish this series will have more seasons to come to satisfy the viewers. Amazing job for the creators, creative persons, casts, crews, and everyone involved. 10/10 highly recommend"
7073,Kingdom,"Great story, great acting, drama, thriller, twists, action, its all there and its done wonderfully."
7074,Kingdom,"I would give it 10 scores but I just hate the ending of S2. I really wish this just end with Cho being the king and the baby is sent back to his mother, and just say ""the queen is dead with her baby due to monster attack"". No people like and trust the kingdom anyway, but they put respect to Cho because he is different than the rest of corrupt governor."
7075,Kingdom,"I myself am not the biggest fan of zombie apocalypse type movies due to the constant theme of America gotta save the day ECT and how they are all based in modern days however I love that kingdom is set during mediaeval Korea wich opens up a hole new type of horror and gives an almost realistic view on how people hundreds of years ago would have responded to a plauge obviously being oblivious to what it is, another aspect that I love was the way they how they executed what could be seen as cliche but instead actually gave a reason behind why it is over all probably my favourite TV show ever."
7076,Kingdom,I'm in awe... this has to be the best series of all time!
7077,Kingdom,"If it was just a zombie story it would be trite and monotonous but they give full focus on the characters and the constant sinister political scheming going on for grabbing power.The character of the crown prince is very well written. He is privileged but did not have a flowery and easy childhood. He is charismatic, empathetic towards the common people and benevolent diverging from the normal trope of evil incompetent crown princes. Lord Cho is in direct contrast an aged man who has already accomplished alot, commands loyalty of the army and will design the most sinister and insidious plots to destory him mercilessly. The central conflict between these two is very well written. The death of Lord Cho was poetic justice, a man who thrived on swallowing and back stabbing others was swallowed by her own snake of a daughter.The plot doesn't make the victory easy for the crown prince which I greatly appreciated, the advantage and events sometimes start favouring him but then the quickly shift to favour Lord Cho.The production design is lush and central performances are great, cinematography and many of the shots are stylish, the score is fitting. Visually and Score wise too it is well done.The ending was bit flawed though the prince should have become the King, I know it is trying to show that he is unlike the rest who don't value others life but he didn't have to kill the baby just return the baby to the original mother and reveal to everyone that he is not actually the deceased King's son, you have the medical expert as witness. By evicting from the throne and letting a baby who can easily be killed by some power hungry minister to grab power puts the nation in jeopardy. Also the two season together tell a complete story and I feel a third season is completely unnecessary and may drag the story needlessly and make it lukewarm since the main political conflict is already over which was the main draw for me. I also don't want an explanation about the resurrection plant it is better as an engmatic mystery.The tactics and strategies to trap, lure and destroy the zombies was also fun to see and workaround in your head and never broke the rules and became implausible."
7078,Kingdom,"It was only when I reached episode 5 of series 1 that I relaized that the Queen was in fact the Prince's mother. This was the Queen who looked about 24/25 and the Prince who was clearly 35-40.This was by no means the most ludicrous part od this series.The evil Queens father bought back to life or at least saved from death by so that he could persecute the Prince and anyone who helped him ( including the woman who saved him).The Prince's right hand man who having taken an arrow through his right shoulder, then gets stabbed in the stomach, then gets a volley of 6 arroes stcuk in his back and rather than dying where he was decides to go for a crawl into the distant forests to be found by the Prince and die in his arms.I swear they must have had a meeting of the script writers who were given an agenda to make this series as ridiculuous and illogical as they could.I used to be a massive fan of all S. Korean films and series but this and Squid Games is making lose faith.PLEASE don't make a 3rd series!!!!"
7079,Kingdom,"This is one of the best zombie series that I have ever seen. I did not expect to watch this series at first, when it was on trend. Many of my friends suggested me since the first season that this series is be worth to watch. I decided to watch when it released season 2 and it did not disappoint me at all. Kingdom is a horror Netflix series that combine the story of period politics and zombies together. Set in Joseon period, by the time strange rumors about their ill king spread through the kingdom. The crown prince becomes their only hope against a mysterious plague that overtaking the land. Within 2 seasons at present, 12 episodes, with a duration about an hour each. As I kept watching, it kept more excited and excited. It took me not so long to finish the whole season. There are so many things that I like about this series. The cinematography and visual effect are just another level, the zombies truthfully look so real, the way they run also make it look scarier. Besides all performers are well casted, they convey their character very well and act very naturally. It would be better that there are more than 6 episodes per season. For me, the last episode of season 1 is the most thrilled part. Kingdom is an 18+ recommended, which included many blood and violent scenes, thus it maybe not be proper for under 18 age or people who easily fearful. Overall, it is a superb series that cram with great outline, incredible performance and leading visual effect. Recommend!"
7080,Kingdom,"I accidentally found this while I was scrolling through Netflix. It's such a great zombie series! It's in thriller and horror genre. The scene, costume, and the effects is so real and believable. The monsters run really fast so my heart too."
7081,Kingdom,"I love all movies/shows thats has anything to do with zombie. But this show..is where all zombie tv need to learn from. I was so used to the adrenaline rush that when i finished the show, i feel so low because I didnt have that rush anymore. Thats what good tv is about! It makes you so engrossed in the story that you feel you are actually living it. AMAZING! Must watch!"
7082,Kingdom,"What a horror thriller series. One of the most beautiful series I have ever seen. Just loved it. Recommended
Happy Watching."
7083,Kingdom,The last episode ruined absolutely everything. Don't waste your time.
7084,Kingdom,"Korean film never fails. Great story line, characters and scary factor. I'm American and absolutely love Asian culture and the historical aspects surrounding it! Very impressed with this series."
7085,Kingdom,This show is really good and I am currently waiting for the 3rd season.The first 2 episodes are kind of slow but it soon picks up its pace with the action.
7086,Kingdom,"This series truly overrated. Even though there are many factors that made this bad, but the thing I hate the most is the logic. They can just solve the problem or defend themselve easily but use the worst solution that made them desperate. Also some of the roles should be clever enough to know the situation, but she/he did something that worsen the situation.Actually my honest rating for this series is 5/10, because there are many series with the same level as this one. But there too many people that overrated this series, so I give 2 star."
7087,Kingdom,"A lo largo de la historia hemos visto distintos tipos de zombies con distintas situaciones cada uno y diferentes ambientes, los hemos visto en videojuegos (Resident Evil), películas (La noche de los muertos vivientes) y hasta en series (The Walking Dead) como es en este caso.Pero Kingdom se diferencia de las demás series, películas o videojuegos de zombies, esta historia es una historia nunca antes vista y creo que podría decir que es la mejor historia de zombies que he visto hasta ahora (o por lo menos en mi TOP 5).Para entender mejor esta historia tenemos que saber qué se ambienta en la época de la dinastía Joseon (1392-1897).La historia empieza con nuestro protagonista que es el príncipe heredero Lee Chang el cual tras saber que su padre esta enfermo y al no poder saber que le pasa ya que le prohiben la entrada al palacio, se embarca con su fiel sirviente Cho Hak-ju a por el doctor que trato a su padre con la enfermedad que tenia.Esta historia se distingue de las demás porque ya no solo hablamos del problema de los zombies sino también le da un giro a estos mismos al darles una historia a estos y una historia a nuestro protagonista totalmente diferente ya que este mismo al recorrer el camino se empieza a dar cuenta de los problemas que tiene su población: no tienen comida, están en la miseria, el gobierno los oprime, etc.Ya por ultimo dire que esta serie tiene una fotografía hermosa con unos planos que nunca se habían visto en otra película o serie de zombies y que se ven asombrosos.Conclusion.Si te gustan las películas o series de zombies te va a encantar esta serie, te enamoraras de los personas y te encantara la historia.10/10."
7088,Kingdom,There is blood eveeywhere.. Whats better and thrilling than that in a series . One problem is solved another appears and I was like bruuuuh they all are gonna die.. must watch this series.
7089,Kingdom,"I was very impress when i start watching season 1 and i'm very excited too wait the next season come on Netflix. Because Jun Ji Hoon appear on the last episode to make spoiler to the next season, it's more misterious and i can't see the ending of this drama.But , you can read Newsboost.com until the next season appear on Netflix.Fakta menarik tentang poker semuanya terangkum dalam Newsboost.News Boost adalah situs yang menyediakan berbagai berita yang terintegrasi untuk membahas perihal terkait judi online.Kami mengumpulkan berbagai berita dan informasi yang menyangkut semua hampir seluruh jenis judi online baik yang tradisional maupun modern.Konten yang kami hadirkan juga memuat referensi agen atau penyedia layanan mesin judi online terbaik yang dapat Anda mainkan agar informasi yang disampaikan akurat.Baca selengkapnya di: https://newsboost.com/category/tips-bermain/"
7090,Kingdom,"This has been one the best shows I have seen in a long while. I binged it in 1 week, both seasons (12 eps total)Great acting, amazing costumes and a brilliant plot that makes, the seemingly played out zombie horror genre, soar.Cannot wait for season 3!!"
7091,Kingdom,"Superb story, excellent cinematography and great acting !!!"
7092,Kingdom,"In spite of a quite original historical background for a zombie series and a few convincing actors, writing is lazy and uninspired, characters' psychology is embarrassingly shallow and inconsistent, editing inflicts on viewers endless boring and useless scenes, chronology regularly lacks any sense at all, dry much as military logics, the most dramatic and supposedly intense scenes are wasted by constant whining and/or screaming. Definitely to avoid if you're over 12yo and are used to pay just basic attention to detail."
7093,Kingdom,"This series is terrible. The plot is poor, the acting is awful with terrible 'over-acting' and ridiculous facial expressions. On top of that, it is very poorly dubbed and translated. If you think this is one of the best horror shows ever made then you clearly need to watch a bit more.. Maybe give Haunting of Hill House a watch instead.. I'm annoyed at just how misleading the ratings are."
7094,Kingdom,"KINGDOM is basically a Korean GAME OF THRONES without a complex plot and nudity.High budgets (USD 1,7 million per episode), really beautiful cinematography, a pleasing eyes costumes and set, great casting decision, and well written story.I love how they edit this series. They give the back story when it needed and in the right time. The portion of ""Zombie's disease"" is long enough so I could appreciate the drama of power struggle for the throne more.I hope Season 2 would have more episodes and not taking too long to be made."
7095,Kingdom,Kingdom is excellent on all levels. A master class in the Zombie genre.
7096,Kingdom,"TV Review: Kingdom Series 1 & 29/10Kingdom is a Netflix Original Korean TV Series first shown in 2019, based on the webcomic series by Kim Eun-hee called 'The Kingdom of the Gods', and wonderfully adapted for TV by her too. With just six episodes in each season (between 36 and 56 minutes), this part crazy zombie horror, part historical political family drama, is a fantastic choice for a binge watch, especially as season 2 directly follows on from the events of the first season.Set in the beautiful landscape of 16th century Korea during the Joeson period, a few years after it was invaded by Japan. Season 1 follows Crown Prince Lee Chang (Ju Ji-hoon) who has been accused of treason by the heartless Queen Cho (Kim Hye-jun), his concubine mother who is no older than he is, and her merciless father, the Chief State Councillor Cho Hak-ju (Seung-ryong Ryu), who is also leader of the Haewon Cho clan, they are slowly trying to pilfer power from the king. Planning on replacing the Crown Prince with a legitimate heir, they confine the smallpox suffering King to his chambers and are keeping him 'alive' with a mysterious plant, while not permitting any visitors, including the Prince.Together with his steadfast servant Mu-Yeung (Kim Sang-ho), the Crown Prince travels in search of the physician who was invited to treat his father at the royal palace, so that he can try and get some clear information on what has happened... Along their voyage, they become acquainted with dauntless physician's assistant Seo Bi (Bae Doona, who you may recognise from Sense 8), the incredibly naïve and selfish Cho Beom Pal (Jun Suk-ho, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Rob McElhenney) and a young enigmatic gunman named Young Shin (Kim Sungkyu).The Crown Prince and his scooby gang must navigate their way through political plots and hordes of the deranged undead whilst trying to unlock the secrets of an outbreak and saving the good people of their nation.The cinematography throughout both seasons is spectacular, with a mixture of vibrant surroundings and authentic costumes, the show makes fantastic use of its high production budget to make the set come to life. The directors really manage to use real horror and emotion to create a sense of dread and impending doom. There is gore aplenty and the zombies are terrifying, don't think snail pace falling to pieces Walking Dead zombies, these guys are a cross between what you would see in World War Z or 28 days later, there's no rest as these zombies with an unusual twist are running non-stop. Another thing running constantly through both seasons is the theme of social inequality, scenes such as burying the rich and burning the poor, and the lower class being starved intentionally by the crown, there is much political intrigue, similar in a way to Game of Thrones, more so in the second season.""Life is the same. The people are still hungry, and the country is still in ruins. But I believe you can bring about change. Am I wrong?""The writing is fast paced, and the plot is multi-layered, with a mixture of shock, drama and a dark comedy that I've now come to expect from Korean writers, each episode adds a layer of suspense and intrigue. Some storylines are quite taboo, especially one which runs through the second season and can be difficult to watch. The characters have great depth and interesting stories, combined with some impressive acting you become emotionally involved in their situations which for me is always a sign of great writing. My personal favourites being Mu-Yeung, his mannerisms and expressions are fantastic to watch, Seo Bi, the heroine and the brains of the outfit, and Queen Cho who is haunting but brilliant.In all honestly this is one of the best shows I've watched in a while; it was entertaining and fresh with twists and turns to keep me on my toes. With season 2 ending on an enigma, there is a possibility of a third season, though nothing has been announced at this stage. If you haven't watched this gem yet, then you're missing out on some amazing television."
7097,Kingdom,"A lot of fake accounts here which are rating the show, too bad. The series have great scenery, sets and costumes. But, the story is slow, the acting is sometimes good, but sometimes terrible, especially from the background actors (which also made me laugh now and then). Anyway, if you don't care too much about good acting and like the concept of Asian zombies, give it a try."
7098,Kingdom,Very interesting and funny horror contentVery interesting and funny horror contentVery interesting and funny horror content
7099,Kingdom,"Kingdom takes place in 16th Century Korea and begins with a tale of political conspiracy: the throwing of the Crown Prince (Ju Ji-Hoon) into exile and cast as a traitor by the King's head magistrate/advisor Jo Hak-jo (Ryu Seung-ryong), who has also managed to put his own daughter in place as the new Queen. As a mystery surrounding the King and his disappearance from public life intensifies a new threat awakens in parallel to this attempted coup. Tied in with this subterfuge is a plague of the undead expanding and spreading across the regions and destroying and devouring everything in its path, and the Crown Prince finds his exile to be right in the plague's path.What is done well is the slow growth from a single undead entity through to a handful and then on to an unmanageable horde and the fear and devastation that ensues parallels this escalation in numbers nicely.
The Crown Prince, the true heir to the throne is intent on claiming his rightful throne and is investigating the situation around this outbreak alongside helping and fighting back against the epidemic with the help of his bodyguard Muyeong (Sang-ho Kim) and nurse/physician Seobi (Doona Bae). There is more to the machinations and plotting than first seems here and I'm very much looking forward to seeing this unfold.The mix of horror/violence and Korean humour feels a bit strange and is thankfully confined to the earlier episodes. It doesn't really fit in having a comedy character alongside the tone and seriousness of the show but the Korean theme of people in positions of power/authority being incompetent/elevated above their ability is definitely on show here.Production values are superb, depicting the time and styles wonderfully well, alongside some truly epic countryside. Which then gets destroyed by the feeding, braindead horde. The action and suspense is really well done and performed. The style of the undead is also particularly impressive as they run but also succumb to multiple falls/trips/stumbles in their mindless pursuit of prey/food."
7100,Kingdom,"The best coming from the zombie genre for years.Plot, story, caracter development, acting, set and costumes are as good as it gets.Im craving for more mayhem."
7101,Kingdom,"Probably the best ""zombies"" EPIC series ever made. Forget Walking Dead. This is a fantastic Series and great acting. The two seasons went by really fast. Hope to see the third one soon."
7102,Kingdom,WHY ONLY 6 EPISODES PER SEASON WHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!
7103,Kingdom,An absolutely astonishing series with a refreshing and more realistic undertone within the zombie genre. The setting. The dialogue. The acting. It's all perfectly intertwined.
7104,Kingdom,"I love this show, the qwality is amazing!!
Even the cast is pict verry wel. The movie sets are just suberb! I love this! 😉"
7105,Kingdom,It surprised me early in the year a good series. Thanks Netflix
7106,Kingdom,"Wow! Zombies in mediaeval times! Well written characters, subtle twists, eerie atmosphere. Bae doona steals the show as a fearless, ingenious physician. Koreans yet again prove they do know how to tell a story. Well done Netflix!"
7107,Kingdom,"Very well acted and innovative series, zombies and internal power struggles all included! Can't wait for 2nd series!"
7108,Kingdom,"Kind of mixture of the Walking Dead and the Game of Thrones.. in unfamiliar time zone.. (the Middle Age of Korea)Nice story line, Nice clothes and Palaces..I think the combination of unexpected things made quite good result..Enjoy your time... 6 episode in one Season is too short!!!"
7109,Kingdom,"Okay so first of all the comparison of 'kingdom' with 'the walking dead' and 'game of thrones' doesn't even make a single bit of sense. When any new show comes with the similar plot and storyline, it is always compared to the shows that are best in that particular genre. This is very ridiculous and stupid,stop doing it. Talking about 'the walking dead', that show is almost completed 150 episodes and has maintained the rating 8.2 even after season 7,8 being lowest rated of the entire series, still it's going strong with it's latest season 9,10 being entertaining again. And this show has 8.3 rating after just 17K votes. If ratings don't matter to y'all then also stop bragging senseless talk. And the comparison with GOT is out of the world. Take this show as a separate standalone show and then write about your opinion, but stop comparing two great shows with this show."
7110,Kingdom,"I love it, I always wanted to see zombies during the medieval era. The origin and characteristics of the zombies are also very original. Definitely recommend!"
7111,Kingdom,"I only checked this out of curiosity but got pleasantly surprised how good it was and ended up bingeing. Every episode is full of action and there's no dull moment. At first I thought the idea of mixing period drama with zombie is laughable but with here, it works. Overall great and I couldn't wait for the next season!"
7112,Kingdom,"The only disappointment was the story for this season ended at just 6 episodes
I hope season 2 is released soon"
7113,Kingdom,"Well choreographed battles along with political intrigue, authentic period costumes and frightening looking zombies makes this series a real treat for horror fans!"
7114,Kingdom,"Thanku Netflix for being global and introducing us to a different filmmaking schools other than Hollywood. WE the non-American viewers are sick and tired from hollywood's films that shows Americans trying to save the planet all the time. But thanks to Netflix we can see different and more beautiful art by (Korea, Spain, Italy, etc. )."
7115,Kingdom,"Korean zombies and horror movies are so well done. I highly recommend this series for its flair, costumes and make up, and look forward to season 2."
7116,Kingdom,Brilliant Masterpiece!!! Every scene from starting to ending it was like damnnnn... Whattt a series man !!!Waiting for season 3. And entire series 😍😍😍😍😍
7117,Kingdom,"Best zombie show ever produced! From the very first episode I was hooked! Has genuine creepy/scary moments and a proper good story! It idsone of my favourite shows of all time, even people who don't watch foreign shows/movies watched this and loved it! A must see for everyone! Especially if you love zombie movies."
7118,Kingdom,"I just finished season 2 and I can only say I want more. This show had me captivated through every episode.
I must admit I had grown tired of the zombie genre, but this show really proved that a genre can never be boring if there is a great plot.
I can only recommend Kingdom, it has everything from great acting, korean history and a well done plot.
I hope a season 3 will come soon!"
7119,Kingdom,"Rating above 8 for trash?
Please do not watch if you have any love for Zombie series. Bad writing , boring waste of time.
Netfail TV Show."
7120,Kingdom,"I'm a huge zombie fan, so I needed to watch this series. Until now, the only Korean zombie flick I'd seen was Train to Busan. If you haven't seen that one yet, I strongly suggest watching it since it's one of the best zombie flicks I've seen. I'm amazed at the level of cinematography coming out of South Korea these days. On par with Hollywood.Kingdom is set in the Joseon kingdom (early Korea) in what I imagine is around the year 1600, judging by the crude long guns and talk of Japanese invasions. This period relied strongly on a caste system, in which noblemen had absolute power over the lower ranks, and those at the bottom were thought of as nothing more than dogs. If you're unfamiliar with Kdrama, you might find some scenes strange when people defer to their seniors without hesitation because of this, but you quickly adjust as you realize this was how life was. I also admit that it can be hard to tell some characters apart when the noblemen are all dressed the same and have the same beards. Most of the time, this doesn't matter.In short and with no spoilers, the crown prince finds himself in a power struggle with the pregnant queen consort and her power-hungry father, who want to take over control of Joseon after the child's birth. The prince suspects something strange is happening at the palace when the queen denies him entry to see the king. When the prince travels to another city for answers, he finds himself in the midst of a zombie pandemic. The prince must find a way to save his people while fighting to regain his place as heir to the throne.Having just finished the 2nd season, I think this show is great. Being set in the medieval wilderness and bamboo huts of Joseon is unique in itself and adds to the tension. There is lots of blood and gore while not going overboard. There are shocking moments that you've never seen in other zombie films, some that have you laughing and others biting your nails. And nobody is safe - rich or poor, young or old.The story line is decent, though it can seem a little jumbled at times. The characters do a great job and I don't feel like I'm watching actors reading a script. It's also nice to see Doona Bae from Sense8 in a native role.I prefer subtitles, though I watched a little bit of the dubbing and found the voice actors seemed adequate. The dubbed version also lined up fairly well with the people speaking, at least from what I saw.If you're into zombie or horror films, give this a chance. I'm highly anticipating season 3 and hope for more seasons after that."
7121,Kingdom,Of the best series I've seen.This makes the undead have feet of mud and tremble to the guts
7122,Kingdom,"It's like game of thrones with Korean Samurai, but things acctually happen here!"
7123,Kingdom,"Well it is medieval ages with the whole meaning of the word, and everyone thinks wt..f with the songs, but I'm writing my first review just for it's sake. I loved it! I loved the show, the soundtracks(every minute I was waiting for one) the special effects, oh yeah those....netflix always does it work! That is how you do it!"
7124,Kingdom,Kingdom on netflix was exciting. Can't wait for season two!
7125,Kingdom,"Excited every second, Serious story, Powerful performance, kingdom is The best of korea series horror of 2019"
7126,Kingdom,"The series is very well directed, but there is a massive amount of stupidity with the main cast and the writing. It takes away from the plot severely."
7127,Kingdom,"Just finished season and am very disappointed that season 2 is not here yet! This is a damn good show that's well worth watching. Im a big horror fan and this delivers in every way. The drama aspect brought in so much for me. I havent been invested into characters like this since The Game of Thrones. Good job to the directors actors, writers and special FX for coming through on this one. A+ work mates.. Cheers!"
7128,Kingdom,"Really love this show has history action comedy drama gore twist great cinematography , writings great acting as well they transform the zombie genre love the pacing of the episodes too .I loved the edge of the seat moments go and watch this you won't regret it can't wait for the next season hope it stays at a six episode season like the walking dead was at the beginning"
7129,Kingdom,"I was skeptical at first.. zombies? Would like to see them pull it off.And they did. Great acting by a wonderful cast, the zombies too. It was surprisingly enjoyable and kept me on the edge of my seat at times."
7130,Kingdom,"Looking forward to Season 3 now, hopefully it's not gonna take too long."
7131,Kingdom,"It's an amazing show, just got to get passed the talking because it's translated into English but still amazing! A twist in your typical zombie shows/movies."
7132,Kingdom,"So disappointed - what appeared to be a grand epic, was just a disguise for a supernatural ghoulish zombie feature."
7133,Kingdom,This Korean film just put all the American zombie movies in place. Damn that was good. Fingers crossed for a few more seasons and more episodes per season.
7134,Kingdom,The best zombie series ever!!! Cant wait for season 2
7135,Kingdom,"Excellent South Korean Zombie drama, Way better then TWD. Cant wait for season 2."
7136,Kingdom,The entire series is a hundred million miles above every thing else. They bought Cinema to TV. Outstanding
7137,Kingdom,"Must Watch!
Both Season 1 and Season 2 are Amazing!!Realistic! Perfect!"
7138,Kingdom,This is a next level release. beyond excellent storyline !
7139,Kingdom,One of those films i heard about but thought its just hyped probably wont like it ill put it on the back burner... I was wrong i also did this with game of thrones. My advice go watch it stop reading reviews its a fantastic series that has a different feel and all the right parts.
7140,Kingdom,"I loved this TV show , good story we wait for the 3 season"
7141,Kingdom,This zombie series is now my favorite! Esp when i saw the last ep. of s2! One of my fave casts Ji Hyun Jun showed up!! Can't wait to watch the s3!! I love everything about this series!
7142,Kingdom,"Walking dead needs to take some tips from this show!! Amazing how the show ends, just gets you mad there's is only 6 episodes."
7143,Kingdom,The best Zombie series in Korean Drama for me. I wish they could add more episodes to season 1. Waiting for the next Season.
7144,Kingdom,"This is series is written by Kim Eun hee same writer who penned tvn hit signal and maybe that's why I gavethis drama a shot.The kingdom is a fresh take on the zombie genre just like every zombie concepta disease breaks out and infects the population and main array of explosions,handguns when fight zombiescharacters fight hard to survive.Unlike other zombie shows kingdom takes place in medievalkorea strips away the usual bombastic/array of explosions, handguns, & tactical gear when fighting offzombies in the typical Hollywood styleThe Drama not only has a fresh take on the genre but also used limited CGI and makeup makes up for aa more realistic vibe.The Actors did a pretty got job the creators know who they are casting.The main cast consists of likable characters. Ju Ji-hoon plays the role of Prince Chang, the Crown Prince who's an only son of the sickly Emperor,set to rule thejoseon. He's a compassionate/simply character with a mellow temper/to some degree introverted who learns to understand the mistreatment of the commoners. Prince Chang becomes gets entangled in the political upheaval and conspiracies to overthrowthe Queen/Hak Ju faction's defilement, alongside the assistance of his trustworthy guardian, Mu Yeong.Bae Doona plays the keen/kind Seo Bi, a doctor's associate who has practical experience in herbs/prescription at Jiyulheon clinic situated in Dongnae, who attempts to discover the remedy for the abnormal outbreak. Indeed, even with all the disturbance, she puts the intrigue/prosperity of others first.Kim Sung Gyu isYeon-shin, who's somewhat reckless and kind of twisted in so many levels. He's additionally has a nicknack for using rifle gun. Much like Prince Chang and Seo Bi, he feels for the commoner's people. He's an individual from a tiger hunting group from Sanju.The intro and end credits are beautiful. The general writing is simplified. Too straight-forward/simple to understand. There's a touch of turns, not excessively shocking but rather satisfying as the mystery unfolds. The exchange/collaborations between characters are decent, not very graceless, in spite of the fact that there is a bit of work, however, needs depth. The acting is good. It isn't excessively dramatized but quite memorable and convincing.Music is additionally something I don't see except if I think that its awful or unfitting, yet in Kingdom that is not the situation. There weren't any extremely noteworthy melodies/ostsin light of the fact that it's everything instrumental to the extent I recollect. In any case, the director has made ideal utilization of music to build tension to keep you at the edge of your seat.The cinematography is lovely with its wide shots of scenic views on rich beautiful forest/royal palace buildings.The ending is anti-climactic with a cliffhanger & twist with so many questions left unanswered."
7145,Kingdom,Fantastic pacing and production. Storytelling is very fresh compared to other zombie genre films. I ended up binging it in just one Sunday evening.Very impressed! Will be anticipating the next season.
7146,Kingdom,"Stuck inside because of the plague? Why not watch a show about a plague?In all seriousness, though, if I haven't mentioned this show before, season 2 just released on Netflix, and it is easily in my top three favorite shows.A taut political drama about rival factions vying for control set against the backdrop of a zombie outbreak. Interesting, well-written characters, well acted, well directed, good pacing (only picked up my phone to look up where I'd seen an actor before). Even Heather was riveted by the story.It compares well to the early seasons of Game of Thrones, but without any of the sexual content or swearing. Violent and gory at times, this is probably not suited for younger children."
7147,Kingdom,"Verry good story, great characters!
Hope there will be a second season!"
7148,Kingdom,"Bingewatched Kingdom on Netflix. I'd go so far as to say that this is one of the best series I've seen in recent years. Not your typical zombie show. Great story and characterisation. 👍🏼👍🏼
It has certain elements of Game of Thrones, such as the ever reliant protagonist like Jon Snow, scheming queen like Cersei, power-hungry patriarch like Tywin Lannister and a bunch of half-dead baddies like White Walkers! The cinematography, production design and musical score is phenomenal! Can't wait for season 2!"
7149,Kingdom,"I was distracted and put this on, thinking was a movie. Stay up until 4am watching all first season, yea that good. Watch it is so good. If you like Game of Thrones and The walking dead. You like this series. Just do not get attached to any of the characters. Be ready to laugh and cry. You will go through an emotional rollercoaster in one episode. Just be ready to be stuck to the TV."
7150,Kingdom,"It's so hard to find decent zombie dramas these days, even more so great ones like 'kingdom'.
As with most of the horror genre, eastern movies/tv series do such an amazing job, and this is no exception! Loved it from start to finish and I cannot wait for season two. Korean medieval zombies, what more could you want! 10/10"
7151,Kingdom,"In general, I was impressed.
Great directing, writing, and acting; Everything Perfect 10/10"
7152,Kingdom,Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! Terrifying! I would recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of horror..
7153,Kingdom,"I had noticed these series on Netflix, but didn't think I was gonna watch. I decided to start watching it a week ago, and now I cannot wait to see season 3 confirmation and hopefully continuation of this amazing story, and the way it is told is incredible. Don't want to set expectations, please watch it, I am sure you will enjoy every second."
7154,Kingdom,I couldn't stop watching it like binge watching game of thrones
7155,Kingdom,"Once you start, you can't stop watching.
Better the z nation, and all zombies movies I have seen.
THE BEST."
7156,Kingdom,Do you remember watching the first season of the walking dead and being amazed at what they pulled off with that show? How lived in the world felt and how great the acting was? Then season 2 happened and it lost its magic. Well this is how I feel about kingdom. This show is amazing. I'm a huge South Korean cinema fan but I tend to stay away from their shows because they're usually just teen dramas but I heard this show was different and was planning on watching it but then I remembered how Netflix loved cancelling their originals so I held off on it. Now a few days away from the season 2 premier I decided to finally start watching this show and I watched all six episodes in one sitting. This show is so damn good and if you're a fan of zombies and/or South Korean cinema then you have to check this one out. It's the most revolutionary zombie property since the walking dead.
7157,Kingdom,"It is not another walking dead, there is a history and objectives. Political and civilians problemas It is a great serie."
7158,Kingdom,"It was hard to concentrate and follow the story. It's not because of the story itself but the pace is quite slow. I think the 6 episodes can be done in 2-3 episodes. If I had to watch it in the cinema without controlling, I could have found this show boring.
Many parts can be skippable ( most fights scenes) , so I finished the seasion 1 in 3 and half hours, and was enough. nothing missed. My expectation for zombie act might be too high though, the zombie acts are pretty awkward.Cannot deny it's interesting to see zombies in historical Asian stories nevertheless."
7159,Kingdom,It's a quiet exciting showing. I recommend it for you
7160,Kingdom,"Well written, directed, and acted and fresh. Loved every episode!"
7161,Kingdom,"Stunning film!
Great directing, writing, and acting
Overall cinematography is 10/10
Cant wait for Season 2!"
7162,Kingdom,Im waiting for season 2. Im always wait for drama like this
7163,Kingdom,"The new attempt to introduce zombies in oriental history, not modern Western zombies, was good, and it is not slow and makes it fun enough for rapid development"
7164,Kingdom,Story and characters are interesting. Watched the entire season in one go. Looking forward for season 2
7165,Kingdom,"The most amazing piece of tv drama in a long time.
An extremely exciting and entertaining mix of asian/korean historic drama and zombie horror. The drama is a classical power struggle between the crown prince of a weak king and heir to the throne on one side and a powerful official who is plotting to get his own bloodline to ascend the throne. This accidently involves the creation of a zombie plague.What is in my opinion amazing about this show is:
1.Like the zombies in World war Z, these zombies are fast, savage and will kill everything in their path, but as a twist only after the sun goes down. They fear the sun so during the day they will hide in some kind of coma. This makes for a great contrast between relatively safety in the daytime and impending doom as night approaches.2. I like the drama and power struggle in the royal court, and the contrast between rich and poor in old Korean society, which is a redline through the series. The greed for power and disrespect for the lower classes is actually the root of the zombie plague.3. The costumes and scenary are just spectacular, so beautiful in 4k resolution. And without being into Korean history the cloth and environment seems very original to the time periode. This can't always be said of many western or chinese period tvseries where people are dressed up like something from Lord of the Rings or other fantasy movies. If the story is placed in a time period stay true to that period.
This means a lot to me as I am a Dane, and I just hate to see how vikings are dressed up like freaking orcs or some kind of other jokes.4. The fight scenes are great and very detailed and gory. I just like the true feeling these scenes depict. Here you won't see any ""House of flying daggers"" style gong-fu with people running around on the roofs or flying through bamboo forest. That was charming and refreshing 15-20years ago, but I just like gritty and true fight scenes where people actually fight for dear mother with all means possible.
You will see small kids gunned down by arrows or eaten by their own zombie mother, so it isn't for the fainth hearted though.5. They kept the series in the original language, which just add to the true feeling. Again as a Dane I grew up with subtitled Hollywood movies, actually that is one of the best ways to learn a language, and the way I learned english and german. If you are watching a Hollywood ww2 movie and the Nazis are speaking english with german accent it is just a no go for me. Please keep all movies in original language and sub not dub.6. The characters all play very well and you get emotionally connected to them and their struggle. Especially the prince's transformation from weak to confident man, who is taking action is interesting.However, I am not overly fond of the sometimes wacky humor, but that is quite normal for korean/asian tv-series, in my experience.Bottom-line, this is a really great show and I swallowed the whole season (6 episodes) in one sitting, and just can't wait for season 2. Well done Netflix and Korean movie industry, it was worth every single penny of abonnement."
7166,Kingdom,"This show is the best show ever made, pure magic.
i love the fact that they speak korean, it makes it like 100 times better, even though i must read the subitiles.
love it, you guys must watch it"
7167,Kingdom,"Awesome show, but its only 6 episodes and it ends with a huge cliffhanger, so unless you like waiting in suspense for about 1 year, then wait for the second season (also 6 episodes) and binge watch. You will like this show if you like walking dead, this reminds me of the beginning of the walking dead, except this is in Korea back in the 17th century which makes it different. The actors are also great, and there is some good humor in here as well. 8/10"
7168,Kingdom,"Actually, it was short. However i didn't know the end was comming. I cannot wait for seoson 2."
7169,Kingdom,"At first, I donot think that it is fabulous but its crazyyy"
7170,Kingdom,Gracefully paced and real atmospheric suspense building
7171,Kingdom,"Way too many 10s here. Idea is awesome, the landscapes and costume and general world building was done very well but in no way is this a 10.First - the characters development and understanding is painfully slow. Of course they shouldn't just know that they are zombies and start fighting but it's like 2 or 3 nights before they stop being frozen with fear and realize they can use a sword. Brings me to second point, why don't they hunt and kill them during the day?Overall felt like the first few episodes were ok with enough of the zombie scenes to make it entertaining but then it finally got really good in episode 5 and 6 (although they really drew this one out) and end it on a bad cliff hanger.My advice would be to wait until season 2 and watch it at once because I don't see myself waiting on edge of my seat to throw it on whenever it comes out"

7751,Kingdom," Cooool
"
7752,Kingdom," Zombies done right
"
7753,Kingdom," Actually created an account to put this in
"
7754,Son: The Guest,"Seen the following scenario before?
An evil being that invades peoples' minds causing them to kill (usually bludgeon or stab) and can move from person to person. Detectives who don't believe in such spirits. Catholic priests who perform their exorcisms.
Not too creative; done too many times before. Nothing new to differentiate."
7755,Son: The Guest,"The Guest: South Korean series about Shamanism, Possession and Exorcism. Sohn (Guest) is a powerful Demon which uses lesser Demons to possess people who then go in to kill their families. In episode one we get the back story of a taxi-driver (also a Shaman), a detective and a priest. Twenty years ago they met up on a fateful night when Sohn was loose, and struck at their families. Now in 2018 the trio meet up again, determined to vanquish Sohn. We see how people mix Shamanism with Catholicism, how even an Exorcist can fall victim to the Demon. The possessed levitate, have superhuman strength and stab themselves in the eyes when they have slain their victims. Dark, disturbing and satisfying! Directed by Hong-sun Kim, written by So-ra Kwon. On Netflix. 8/10."
7756,Son: The Guest,"I usually avoid horror, so I missed this one when it first came out. Then it popped up on Netflix this month, and because of being confined during COVID like millions, I decided to try it. The entire cast is wonderful, the writing and direction superb. And yes it's scary in places but also deeply moving in the building of relationships, and a young person becoming what he was meant to be. However, I did think this could have been done well in 12-14 eps as the last ones felt repetitive and draggy. But I liked the series very much."
7757,Son: The Guest,"A policewoman, a priest and a shamanic taxi driver come together to try and stop a murderous spirit which can control other demons and make them possess normal people who then become vicious murderers. The three all have links in the past where members of their family were murdered by these demons. It is a well acted and dark series although I think it could have been shortened as my interest waned in the middle."
7758,Son: The Guest,"So i only could take one hour of this maybe you all like, it not me"
7759,Son: The Guest,"This show was all around a great watch. The horror elements were very well done - I found the first half of the show to be very scary and creepy. The soundtrack is excellent and along with very good cinematography this is a well-crafted horror drama that was compelling and held my interest to the very end. In addition there was very good acting, and a satisfying ending that made sense, tied everything together, and was deserved. I would definitely recommend this to any horror/thriller fans!"
7760,Son: The Guest,One of the best horror series I have seen! Although some of the plot device were very frustrating; especially the one where people did not communicate with each other. But that is a plot device used in most horror movies/series. In this case it just would've made a shorter series. It still leaves it - awesome.
7761,Son: The Guest,This is exactly what has been missing from the horror genre.Fantastic writing and superb acting from a perfect cast.I really hope they continue 🙏
7762,Son: The Guest,"I struggled with the first few episodes, getting used to reading subs, I found it difficult with the poker face expression on the priest but as episodes went by I could see it was all in his eyes. It wasn't long before I was totally gripped by this well crafted Korean show. The actors who played the leads did an excellent job of conveying pain, strength and friendship throughout, considering the priest barely smiled or spoke. Totally mind blowing story with twists and turns. Do Korean shows not show intimacy and romance? Weird how the main leads showed no interest in romantic relationships. Not be missed."
7763,Son: The Guest,"Nothing that was really outstanding with this series. It was like ""Fast food/drive-thru"" exorcisms. One character says exorcisms would take months or years. Anyway, it's always fun to see how the writers have the characters get out of weird situations.It was okay to watch because I had the feeling that it was going to be fairly predictable."
7764,Son: The Guest,"Perfection ....makes Hollywood look like amateur crap. Hollywood actors are so bad looking these days,,,huge foreheads no upper lip...here casting is beautifully done... perfect selection... perfect story...so interesting....every episode is great....great acting from every one... hope Hollywood doesn't steal it and put their crappy actors and spoil this beauty...hats off."
7765,Son: The Guest,Reviews that I have ever seen reviewing a film/series on IMDB. Seriously nearly every single one has only one review by the reviewer and guess what...they are almost all 10s!!!!!!!!!!!Now for a legit review. It is a good series. It is a bit on the gory side so if that bothers you either fast forward or deal with it. I do like the fact that there are not so many goofy comic effect moments that you see in so many of these series as well.
7766,Son: The Guest,"I really enjoyed this tv show. It was scary at times but never too much.
The story was well written and the last episode was particularly good.
Definitely worth watching."
7767,Son: The Guest,I usually don't review till I watch the complete product but I can't with this director... everything is obvious but it's played as if not. Director shots of scary scenes seems to be the main focus of this compared to telling a story. I couldn't even finish his other drama black.
7768,Son: The Guest,Great story and acting. Primarily a drama with some horror. I binge watched it on Netflix. Shows rarely reel me in like this. Highly recommend!
7769,Son: The Guest,"If I'd praise a series for being an excellent example for character development , for sure it'll (The Guest).It's well written that the main characters are integrating , a Wise one ,an emotional one and a fearless one.Everything is connected to target the main event , even if side story is introduced , it cumulatively contributes to that final act.Each episode is filled with all kind of genres with a thrilling pace encapsulated with a horror theme , there are moments where a rollercoaster defines the greatness of each episode.Directing is perfect , cast is well chosen and music is epic.This one of my favorite korean shows and I like to see more of this."
7770,Son: The Guest,"I am still watching this amazingly fantastically good show. i am in Ep3 and wishing the series don't end. I can't get enough of it. I watched alot of K-Drama in Netflix, Crash landing on you, Under the rain etcetc. Each one is good on its own category. This one ranks one of the top ten, that's why I gave it a ten.
The acting is great, photography is top-class, equal to any Hollywood can offer. No expense spared to bring the audience to seaside, to the wide open fields, to dungeon, dives, dirty smelly tunnels. The list goes on. The Production goes the whole nine yards to deliver a high class horror movie, not filled with blood and gore, but enough to keep the viewer at the of the seat. It's that good. I'm gushing I know, and I'm unshyingly admitting it. Don't believe, go check it out, see if you don't agree. finish at least two episode and see if your tongue don't droll for more more more. who knows, you may even overtake me in your binge. Enjoy. Thank me later."
7771,Son: The Guest,"Why is this show so underrated?!! Its a tad too dark, but overall great story, decent actors, good flow, gripping scenes, keeps you hooked.. not your typical kdrama, but absolutely worth a watch if you don't mind dark and gory stuff!"
7772,Son: The Guest,"It starts off very good for me atleast but in the middle it starts to fall off and i didnt liked the ending that much, but certainly a good show to watch it has creepy/paranormal/ crime drama vibe, not a typical k-drama no romance in the series."
7773,Son: The Guest,"Story, acting, twist, and cinematography are very well done. You can't wait to watch next episode after every episode done. They almost make every episode feel like you watch movie, very tense horror thriller. Its really breakthrough K-drama you can watch. My self are really picky when come to matter of watch TV Show because in many case they can't hold the tension and excitement until few episode left out, but i can say ""The Guest"" are
managed to surpass that problem. The chemistry between three leads are very good and every scene about possessed are really creppy and believable. If you really like horror, with thriller, suspense, excorsist, i strongly suggest you to give it a shot to watch this series. Its pure tense without some unnecessary love scene like other mainstream K drama."
7774,Son: The Guest,"It was an amazing show, I never leave comments or reviews so this is definitely saying something. I just wish that Yook Gwang didn't end up being killed and that Park Hong-Joo was found out and didn't have to live a happy life since she was pure evil! Overall absolutely loved Priest Choi Yoon (Kim Jae-wook- Coffee Prince and Her Private Life) and liked the other two leads Kang Gil-young (Jung Eun-chae- The King Eternal Monarch and The Great Battle) and Yoon Hwa-pwung ( Kim Dong-wook- Coffee Prince and Trade your love)."
7775,Son: The Guest,I have seen hundreds if not thousands of horror movies. Usually I am bored and not scared. My favorite movie of all time is The Exorcist and that scares me every time I watch. When I watched this series I was blown away. The acting is superb. The writing is awesome. The background music is creepy. I Don't rate many shows as a 10 but this one deserves it!If you like being scared watch this in the dark with the sound turned up.... I am pretty sure it will freak you out.
7776,Son: The Guest,"What a great piece! The chemistry of the cast, the story, the acting, especially the script! I love all of it!
one of the best drama I've watch from 2018!!!MUST WATCH!!"
7777,Son: The Guest,"This show has a dark, promising start. Sadly, the shows characters become so idiotic that you start rooting for the villains. I honestly wished for the victims and the protagonists to be killed off because they were so stupid..."
7778,Son: The Guest,"The story is original in choice of the subject and fascinating, although the second half part of the story was a little spent.
The description of humanity and friendship were impressed, It's still worth watching"
7779,Son: The Guest,"If you love thriller ,mystry then it is definitely for you
It is the best korean drama in 2018 i can say to that
If you have seen signal defendant you should definitely see it it will keep you at the edge of the seat till the end of the show
You 're gonna predict wrong i can say that juat
Just see it youre gonna enjoy it
Every episode is super exciting!"
7780,Son: The Guest,One of the best shows out there on Netflix. Engaging from the beginning till the very last minute. Every episode is brilliant.
7781,Son: The Guest,Highly recommended to watch this series. You will live the trio as well as the whole vibe. Loved it so much.
7782,Son: The Guest,"I truly enjoyed everything about this show except for the female lead. I feel like they made her so unlikable that it threw off the whole show. I understand that she is a stubborn cop but they take it to far here and make her heartless. I cant connect to her like I can the other 2 leads. To me she spoiled it. Whenever I saw her get smart with someone, yell at someone, or dismiss people for her own viewpoints i wanted to turn it off. Without her I would've given this show 5 stars but because she was such a central part of it only 3. 1 spoiled apple can ruin the bunch. Maybe next time try not to make her such a rude and hateful person."
7783,Son: The Guest,"It kept me guessing , which I love. Acting was great, and characters were likable. Took a little to warm up to Father Mathew. I really like the way the South Korean entertainment community can combine humor in whatever genre is being filmed. For those who haven't seen them, Black (occult) and Prison Playbook ( prison & sports) are as good as The guest."
7784,Son: The Guest,"Best K-drama i have seen, i literally don't like K-drama but this one is mind-blowing. 16 episodes later i realized um obsessed with this series."
7785,Son: The Guest,"Best korean show I've watched so far, the bgm is awesome, really love the song somewhere, every moment is special in this series, never get bored"
7786,Son: The Guest,"Horror, drama and mystery!
Congratulations to the director!!
Great performances and a mind-blowing story!!!"
7787,Son: The Guest,"I dont know about others. But this series brought teaes to my eyes. Feel lucky I came across this.
Horror, script, presentation, emotions, friendship, what a BLEND!"
7788,Son: The Guest,"I would say this drama is by far the best korean drama I've watched.I was hesitant to start it at first because it was a horror genre series. Not my typical Korean drama genre I opt for. But this drama changed my perception for horror genre. It was so mind-blowing. Not because it was scary or whatever, it's just pure good acting and the storyline.Hard to believe they've managed to pull off a korean drama to be so good without any romance being involved. Yet, the chemistry between the main casts are so well portrayed and you can literally feel it. Still can't get over the bond between the casts and the soundtrack is so on-point. Brings out all the feels in you.You tend feel to feel so much mixed emotions while watching this. I'd cried my eyes out for few of the episodes as well.Overall, it's just a perfect drama with an A class plot. Some horror dramas tend to be illogical or fake sometimes but this was well-scripted with great acting by all the cast.Go watch to all that are having second thoughts on whether to start the series or not. You'll never regret it."
7789,Son: The Guest,What an amazing series. The storyline was brilliant and griping until the very end. The acting was some of the best ive seen and it kept me guessing the whole time. The 3 exude friendship and love in a way that is not conveyed through the physical. Easily one of the best series ive watched
7790,Son: The Guest,"Amazing storyline and satisfying ending. Could not have asked for more. The horror part was definitely there, but in such a good way. Also the friendship part was very emotional to see throughout the episodes."
7791,Son: The Guest,"I really wanted to like this series. Actors are good as well as the cinematography. I also thought the main characters are great, with Detective Kang being my personal favorite. She def knows how to kick some a... even though her fighting skills seem to be almost gone by episode 6. N that's what ruined the whole series for me - the writing. First of all, I'm not sure about the cultural background but everyone at the police force apart from her seems to be completely stupid, then suddenly everyone is stupid - character decisions and reactions that make absolutely no sense at all. Worste being the demon/ spirit that keeps people alive and has his mandatory rant, just that people can be saved by some last minute deus ex machina event - it totally ruined the immersion for me. Overall a decent series with some huge plotting deficits, if u can get passed that, you're gonna have some escapism at least. As for now I'd give it a 4 if it wasn't for badass detective kang."
7792,Son: The Guest,"Great acting from the two male top actors and others also are truly great especially the possessed ones. Great effects that are actually done not much VFX or CGI.It kinda gets loose at the middle part but the starting and the ending is epic. Totally recommend it if you like exorcism and people getting possessed.Sound track is beautifully putted to intensify the feelings and there is no romance so if you don't like romance, it's your go to."
7793,Son: The Guest,"Other than the fact that this is not your typical K-drama, the Guest is not your typical drama either. Every episode of it will leave you on your seats, wanting more, making this one of those amusement park rides you don't want to let go of. The acting, directing and story are all woven together from end to the finish. Watch this masterpiece because it is completely worth it."
7794,Son: The Guest,Very good if slightly drawn out show. It suffers from the same melodramatic tone that a lot of Asian shows suffer from but only occasionally and not enough to detract from the main storyline or the excellent actors from the main guys to the side characters.
7795,Son: The Guest,"I will surely missed the beautiful friendship bond of Hwa Pyung, Kil Young and Choi Yoon.Great series for this genre."
7796,Son: The Guest,"The show grips you from the first episode itself & has many layers to it. The highlight of the show is the bond between the 3 main characters & their struggles to reach their objective. The additional characters do their part well and contribute to the overall experience. The cinematography, settings, editing and atmosphere of the layout is superb. At times scary & intense but the heart of the story is the extraordinary bonding between the primary characters.Another area that adds up to the success, is the background score and the solo track 'Somewhere'. It brings a very emotional outburst to the show's flow.A tight storyline and beautiful performances by the characters brings to life a very enjoyable & thrilling experience...Overall, do not miss this show & I really hope the creators work on a season 2. Thank the creators & artists for making this such a memorable show."
7797,Son: The Guest,I almost died from a heart attack. This series almost scared me to death. I don't usually watch horror themes but this series hooked me. The acting was superb. I loved every second of it. It kept me on the verge of a breakdown but I finished one chapter and had to start the next one right away. Although with the heart in the hand . Wow!!! I congrats you!!!
7798,Son: The Guest,"I have rated this 10 out of 10 as I think this is one of the best horror I have seen so far. This is not a Korean typical drama. The story line, the acting are just perfect.
Even though the horror is about exorcism and possessed people highlighting today's society problems from a different perspective, the main story focuses rather on friendship. I strongly advise you don't miss this one!"
7799,Son: The Guest,"It took my some time and a lot of thinking to start this one as I thought a horror centred plot wouldn't interest me. But obviously I was wrong. I enjoyed each episode of it, well done characters with no extra/irrational traits. Would've loved to have an extra episode of the 3 friends (main characters) just having free time and enjoying life. The ending was a bit rushed but I feel that's the case with most of kdramas. Can't complain tho. Had fun watching it, really recommend."
7800,Son: The Guest,"I wish many people who love maniac occult would enjoy this TV show with various languages 
I tell you I'm pretty good at horror shows, occult stuff. However, this is obviously beyond most of exsting occult stuff.
This show is an accomplishment of Traditional Korean superstition and Western occultCaution: If you have a trouble with sleep, I recommend you to avoid watching the show before get to bed. 
Also, if you're not that good with horror stuff, you better prepare spare panties. Do not watch the show by your own!"
7801,Son: The Guest,Best drama I've ever seen in my whole entire life !! And this is also the first korean drama that made me rate and review it on IMDB!
7802,Son: The Guest,"Guest isn't a typical Kdrama. Rather than horror the highlight of this dramas is Friendship. Every second of this drama is worth watching and there no single scene is boring or need to skip. The cinematography, acting, script, costume everything is amazing. Don't miss out this gem. One of the best korean dramas in 2018."
7803,Son: The Guest,"OCN produced a modern horror classic in 'The Guest'. High production value, solid storytelling, memorable acting and a unique blend of Korean shamanism & Catholic tradition. The pilot episode (ep.1) is arguably the most perfect pilot episode in Kdrama history. The tension in the story builds up and up and reaches a satisfying climax and conclusion. Recommended."

7854,Hell Is Other People,"Korean Drama ""Strangers From Hell"" is a dark story that builds up to the great final twist in the end. The only thing that was missing was a bit of a more craziness of the main villain. All the others were mad enough to be triggering the insanity of the main character.The latter was the star of the drama and the sole focus of it, as his downfall was well-orchestrated, even though there were evidence from the start that something was off that he himself was trying to suppress.The performances, finally, were all great from everyone in the cast and the atmosphere pretty dark and suspenseful.So, overall, 7 out of 10."
7855,Hell Is Other People,"Claustrophobic and unsettling in almost every scene. Even the most standard and regular shots or dialogues left me with a feeling of sickness. Whenever I thought I adjusted myself to the grim atmosphere they turned it up a notch. Could have been a bit more streamlined towards the middle/end episodes (esp not sure about some of the flashbacks or dream sequences). The finale was a bit underwhelming, not bad or anything, it was just not as creepy & subtle as the overall series in my POV. Nice twist though. In summary: Throughout creepy partly horrific at times unbearable.
Hell is other people, the lit. translation is a way better title and provides actually some meaning and logic to the overall story. If you look for a truly horrific and disturbing show go for it!"
7856,Hell Is Other People,"This drama shows how atmosphere affects on human nature,how atmosphere badly forms or shapes daily lives. This drama focuses on studio apartment where people are weird and abound with suspicious activities. When a new guy named Jong Woo comes and starts living in it, he starts noticing weird people which also freaking him out. He is getting clues about missing people who have been missing while living in this studio. As day passes, he started hallucinating and he can also feel the changes in himself. He is becoming one of them. What's really going on this studio? Why people are getting missing?I was supper excited about this drama but I'm bit disappointed. There are some plot holes. I was expecting a bit, maybe a more interesting ending. However, the ending was ambiguous.But, I think, there were really a guy named Moon Jo who was serial killer. Moreover,he really killed guys and made bracelets out of their tooth. But somehow he found similarities between he and Jong Woo,so he tried to make him like him who can resemble his personality even better. But at the end Jong Woo killed Moon Joo. We can see, there were some visuals where Moon Joo was shown, maybe it was because finally Jong Woo becomes like him by killing four people."
7857,Hell Is Other People,A young man moves from the countryside to Seoul to be near his girlfriend but finds it difficult to locate affordable accommodation. In desperation he moves into a rundown building in an area waiting to be redeveloped. He soon wishes he hadn't as the building is occupied by some very strange residents indeed. A well acted series which is claustrophobic and the tenants really are menacing. It is only a short series at ten episodes but I found it a difficult watch as there is no let up on the foreboding and dark air.
7858,Hell Is Other People,"This was one of the most intense and amazing psychological thrillers I have seen. The acting is fantastic, and the cinematography combined with a perfectly haunting soundtrack created an atmosphere that is crackling with energy and tension. I was absolutely spellbound from the first five minutes until the last. The story isn't necessarily that complex, and it could be argued that the ending was a bit predictable, but the journey is what is important in this series. The psychological torture and metamorphosis is so heart-pounding and brilliant that you just can't look away. I cannot recommend this highly enough."
7859,Hell Is Other People,"I suppose this drama is saying something about the potential for violence within us all or something.It's well acted, has good characters. But for me, it never really catches fire. The ending was kind of a mild surprise for me."
7860,Hell Is Other People,"Well, I hope Netflix is gonna keep producing Korean and Japanese horror/fantasy series.
I could totally feel how the main character would go crazy, living in that kind of building with that kind of neightbors (I'd have moved away sooner though).
No overacting, not overdramatic, really freaky ambiance."
7861,Hell Is Other People,"Someone Recommened me this KDrama( Tv series) Want to say Not regret after watched it Direction,Script,Story was Solidl
Back ground music was great,Creepy also perfectly matched with eerie atmosephere,Camera work,Editing was mindblowing all cast Acting was too good especially Jung woo( Lead), Moon jo( negative) & Hajimma( Lady),Twins,Pervert A must watch Series for Those love Thriller,Suspense Hardcore movies"
7862,Hell Is Other People,One of Korean terrible series it could be end in 90 minuts but things keep going on same things. Totally waste of time.i mean how can be people so follish and police.
7863,Hell Is Other People,"Nessa analise me baseei em 5 importantes pontos: Enredo, desenvolvimento, personagens, estética e entretenimento.Enredo: 2/2.Desenvolvimento: 2/2.Estética: 2/2.Personagens: 2/2.Entretenimento: 2/2."
7864,Hell Is Other People,"Strangers from Hell (also known as Hell is Other People/ Tainuen Jiokida) based on a webtoon by the same name, was an excellent psychological horror drama, full of dark, gritty weirdness. It many ways it takes you down the rabbit hole, so to speak, delving into dark topics on the basis of human nature. Are we good? Are we evil? Perhaps there's only a fine line in between. Strangers from Hell showcases all that darkness of human nature and exhibits the increasingly troubled mind of our struggling young protagonist as he deals with other people, and their various forms of evil and darknesses.The synopsis is this. The story of a young man, Yoon Jong Woo (Im Si-wan) in his 20's who moves to Seoul after landing an internship in a company. While looking for a place to stay, he stumbles upon Eden Studio, an ominous cheap dormitory and decides to stay there as he is low on money. Though not thrilled about the quality of the place and its abnormal residents, including his next-door neighbor Seo Moon Jo (Lee Dong-wook), he decides to tolerate it until he saves enough money to move out. However, mysterious occurrences start occurring in the studio, causing Jong Woo to start fearing the studio's residents.Everything escalates from there. And what we get is such a masterpiece, though one that might be difficult to stomach, as its themes get increasingly darker and darker. Suffice it to say there are many references of murder, torture, cannibalism, and other forms of cruelty that can make most of us a bit squeamish. The slow build up, jarred with occasional but shocking scenes of violence or the macabre, makes the whole experience rather tense.As a whole, the show completed what it set out to do. Give us viewers a dismal and disturbing glimpse into human nature, as through a mirror darkly. It does so brilliantly. Combine the excellent cast and acting, great original soundtrack, with great story buildup, and elements that mix the mystery, crime, suspense, and horror genres, you get an utterly twisted journey such as this series. It definitely might not be for everyone, especially for the faint of heart. It gets under your skin.STORY: 9/10
CINEMATOGRAPHY: 10/10
ART/DESIGN/VISUALS: 10/10
MUSIC: 10/10
OVERALL RATING: 9.5"
7865,Hell Is Other People,"It's good but too many scenes where the bad guys get all the breaks and the good guys make bad choices. Police are worthless as usual. And some of the content feels like ""filler"" to meet the hour long episode requirement. But watching something that did not follow the predictable American plotline was refreshing... Not sure if I liked the ending"
7866,Hell Is Other People,"First of all, it's sick, dark and disturbing. Violence and creepiness is all over the show and the way it is filmed is sadistic and gritty. It definitely made an impact on to my heart and if you ask if it would make a good thriller, yes it would! It would make your heart pound incessantly that you would feel terribly sick after a while.Coming to the story, it didn't work out that much. No matter how much you try to convince yourself, the characters are stupid. You have to agree on that. Moreover, every character in this story is irritating like they all have some mental disorder and they lack something called 'Common Sense'.The series is also lagging at times with fillers that wouldn't add anything to the story and some creepy moments that wouldn't make any sense but are added to the screenplay either to give some cheap thrills or to elongate the episode.The climax is sort of clichéd and is not that good. Over all, Strangers from hell or hell is other people is a 'you've seen it all' series that would have worked out if it had been a film or mini-series."
7867,Hell Is Other People,"For me, the series was quite creepy, and unsettlingly sick. Sure there were plot holes that could have been connected and explained, but the visuals were fitting. Lee Dong Wook played quite the murderous character and some of his expressions were downright hideous."
7868,Hell Is Other People,"I am almost through the 3rd episode and so far this show is incredibly boring. I dislike nearly every character, and many of them are so annoying I want to turn the sound off when they appear. Most of the scenes feel like meaningless, unconnected, pointless shots of people doing random things.This show has great ratings and reviews. When does this start to improve, because I don't know how much more of this I can stand. I feel like I am enduring this show, not enjoying it.It is too bad that Amazon got rid of the comment section when they bought IMDB and removed a lot of the good functionality."
7869,Hell Is Other People,"It's not easy to complete this series without feeling queasy, anxious and angry all at once. Lee Dong Wook (as Moon Jo) did an amazing job at being the highest culprit of all, and same goes to the actress whose role is the residence owner (can't recall her name at the point of writing). Hated her hair, her face, her grin, her disgusting way of making meals, and her pervertness towards the protagonist Jong Wu (Im Si Wan), the same hatred feeling for her in her role as the maid in the movie Parasite. The supporting roles of the hellish people in the residence are totally sickening-looking. Can't imagine if I were to be in the male lead's shoes.. i would have been discouraged by the stairs leading to the residence already. But yeah, this is a story, and I feel sorry for Jong U, wanting to search for a career in Seoul, but instead it took its toll on his physical and mental health, and it turned out to be a complete mess.In short, this series is a total psychological thriller. The production team deserves all the applause for such amazing acting + cinematography + set + lighting + everything else that made the series what it is.I just didn't like the ending though.. while I'm glad all the sick people are dead, I would like the male protagonist to have a little bit more self control over himself and his feelings, and know when to walk away. He really didn't know how to improve himself, argh that's annoying, really. Hated the fact that Moon Jo had successfully rubbed himself on Jong U, although he died.What the story didn't explain though, is the development of relationship between Ms Um and Moon Jo. How did he become a dentist? Is he really a certified dentist, or just some guy with know-hows to stitch cuts and pulling out teeth? Did Ms Um really raise him to tertiary education with that sort of mental state? Unexplained. The script just made Ms Um mentioned a little bit of her raising Moon Jo as an orphan (in episode 10), but it's really not enough to understand why Moon Jo and Ms Um are so sick and mental.So, my verdict: 7.7/10.
A thriller worth to watch.
Would I want to watch it again? Nope."
7870,Hell Is Other People,"1- our main character forgot to lock his door once
2- when the doctor killed the reporter he spit .. which would lead the police for his dna
3- the reporter didn't call the cops whatsoever.. also why he thought it was okay to get out of the office literally after a murderer just killed someone
4- the main character had plenty of time to contact with the female cop which was always there ready to help him .. but he didn't
5- why didn't the cops check the security cameras to see the main character getting dragged on the floor
6- police suspect that he's the main killer .. but why would a killer kidnap his girlfriend
7- when the girlfriend was kidnapped.. couldn't they watch the security cameras too ? Like the building she was living in looks expensive
8- what is up with the doctor .. he seems untouchable.. like he has super powers .. he appears and disappears whenever he wants
9- there was a scene where the crazy twin pull up a baggage and hug it .. that wasn't explained.. what was that ?10- if the crazy twin found out that the doctor knows everything.. why would he go to the roof to kill the main character and not the doctor? If it was in fact his intentions.11- what happened to the Christian woman in the karaoke room ? We never see her again
12- at the end .. did the main character lose his mind ? Does it mean he has split personalities.. why he keeps seeing the doctor even tho he's dead .. at the end did the doctor posses the main character soul ?13- if the main character cared so much about his girlfriend.. why didn't he after he freed himself .. run to her too and do the same ? .. he somehow leaves her tied to the chair like she isn't even there
14- what is up with the new guy .. he asks for a charger then we see him in his room using a charger that apparently works just fine
15- when the doctor killed the main character's boss .. couldn't they check the cameras ? It's literally right there
16- the reporter knew who the killer is but still didn't call the cops although he had plenty of time.17- when the main character knew that his boss died .. that means he has no job no more .. why did he stay in the city ?18-Even tho he killed the murderers , he's still a victim .. like everyone knows he hated that dorm
it was so obvious Yet the cops actually suspected him
19- another plot hole .. the doctor said to the main character , you did enjoy all the murders u have done here , what did that mean .. did the main character kill anyone else other than the murderers ?"
7871,Hell Is Other People,"""One of the darkest thriller dramas"", When I say it, I truly mean it! Cause dark doesn't always have to deal with utmost cruel murders and torture, there's surely a lot in the drama but it is something that haunts your soul. I had the same feeling after Midsommar. It is slow and intriguing that at a steady pace pierce into all your weaknesses and makes you shiver with horror.I truly feel the whole team did a great job, especially the story and ambience. How the story of a residence and its members which is not even a horror house (though nothing less than that) could trigger so many intense feelings and give you chills.I am awed!! And demanding more of it rn, I hope it gets renewed for more seasons cause it is one of my favourites. The actors did a fine job and are the ambience, that's definitely too creepy and suites great.A MUST WATCH!!!! (Not for faint hearts plzz)"
7872,Hell Is Other People,"The first half was intriguing but the other was disappointing.There were clear hints of what the end will be and I have no problem with that but it was done in a predictable manner.
Idk but it needed something else. The writer also threw away what he was planning with the new outgoing guy. He clearly had other intentions when he was shown with a lot of chargers but the writer cop out."
7873,Hell Is Other People,"Why, why, WHY did he stay there after day one of all the weirdness?! And why is his girlfriend not listening to him and being so non-supportive?! I do enjoy two great actors in such different roles! This is why I gave it an 8 rating."
7874,Hell Is Other People,"I won't spoil the ending, I will only say that I HATED IT!!!"
7875,Hell Is Other People,"Confusing and illogical storylines, plot holes galore, idiotic and unlikeable main characters, ridiculous dialogue and the introduction of new characters later on that serve absolutely no purpose are just a few of the things that plague this series. Four out of the five stars I give this series were for the creep factor it and the music."
7876,Hell Is Other People,"Lee dong wook never disappoints with his acting, he absolutely killed his rule (quite literally) he completely immersed himself in his role as a good actor does. Everything about his characters was believable, his creepy smile, sinister eyes, eery stance and gaze. All the other actors did very well too. I was gripped and on the edge of my seat at times because of how intense some scenes were. For those saying they don't understand the protagonist and why he didn't just leave, please watch carefully the reason why the dentist was able to manipulate him so well is because he saw himself in him meaning the protagonist already had problems the dentist just set off the bomb in his head. He was a ticking time bomb waiting for a trigger. 100% recommend for a break from all those Rom com clichés."
7877,Hell Is Other People,"Not sure how this has a 7.9 rating cause it really isn't that great, but it is a fun show to watch. (wrote this while watching the last episode)Don't waste your time if you're looking for something scary or suspenseful cause it really is none of these things. But it's shot well has pretty main characters and hey it's Korean...If they would have told the story in 6 episodes it probably would have been really good, but this dragged while we all know how it will end.If you pass over the over acting of the main character the acting overall is pretty solid, right until the end which makes less sense than the IQ of all the characters of the whole series. In all honesty.. any regular Joe would have solved this case in half a day.It's just way too long and needed a bit more spice and a little more intelligence to be at least a little suspenseful.The ending made me change my 5 score to a 3 cause, well it's just dumb and makes no sense whatsoever and completely makes the whole series even less convincing.But, i still finished the whole damn thing, so at some level it was entertaining... Just not for the intended reasons i guess."
7878,Hell Is Other People,This drama is like a movie. Great acting too. You will not be disappointed if you're in for the ride.Warning: You need tough stomach for this.
7879,Hell Is Other People,"The creators of this show do such an amazing job of making the viewer empathize with the main character. You feel as disgusted as he feels, as frustrated as he feels, as tired as he feels. As life knocks him down, instead of making the viewer root for him to get back on his feet, they make the viewer want to tear down the world so that he doesn't have to struggle anymore. You really start to delve into madness with the character. Some of the best storytelling EVER. The villains make you want to hop in the shower and cleanse yourself. Like there should be a masterclass on it. I praise the writing, but the actors did their thing too. Lee dong Wook is always going to be amazing but the main character was so relatable. His facial expressions make you laugh just cause of how perfectly spot on they are. The ending does leave a lot to guess but I don't think that's a bad thing at all. I think this is a perfect drama if you're a fan of suspense."
7880,Hell Is Other People,"I'm not a big fan of MHG, but I've read a few of her books, but I am sure she was an influence in the writing here.The tense buildup, the character development, the long climax with an intense feeling of real time emergency on several perspectives ; the pacing, the acting, the photography, the camera work are spot on on so many levels.Moon-jo is one of the creepiest villains ever caught on film (and casting Dong Wook-Lee, a model more famous for his heartthrob roles in teenage girls-dramas, was genius), and actress Jeong-eun Lee (of ""Parasite"" fame) as the housekeeper delivers gold.Watching this gem you are in for an intriguing, chilling, thrilling ride."
7881,Hell Is Other People,Absolutely loved it it was so dark and gruesome and had me on the edge of my seat after every episode
7882,Hell Is Other People,"Beautifully shot, thought provoking thriller, great acting, great script. What else to ask for?
This isn't your average K-drama, this is what every thriller should be."
7883,Hell Is Other People,"It has an very spooky and creepy vibe, its diffrent from other shows there are no cheap jumpscares, the story is well written, and the main actors are descent but its very gloomy and hard to watch because you feel bad for the main character at least for me. It truly is a very veryy good tv series if you are into dark dramas you will enjoy this!"
7884,Hell Is Other People,"The story hooks you in right away. The atmosphere is chilling and there is a sense of paranoia, making you wonder who can be trusted. However, it starts falling off once new characters are introduced halfway through the season. It ends with an obvious opening to a sequel, which detracted from an otherwise really creepy show."
7885,Hell Is Other People,"I really loved the grim reaper from Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (Goblin) aka Lee Dong-wook so much so that I had to watch his Touch Your Heart and now this. This was a completely different role that he took on and I loved it. It was dark, his character reminded me a lot of Mads Mikkelsen's Hannibal Lector. A beautiful man with a dark soul. Yoon Jong-woo (Im Siwan) just needed someone to listen to him, to believe him, to understand his feelings. We see a 27 year old man go from being excited and happy about his new internship, moving away from home and closer to his girlfriend to a man that doesn't seem stable enough to be in society. If some of the characters just heard him out, would they be able to save him? I found myself being reminded of some of the bullying that is experienced in the adult working world. It's scary what the real world is actually like."
7886,Hell Is Other People,"Bullies at work..
Psychopath roommates..
Such a living nightmares...
Feeling depressed watching this and yet I can't stop watching."
7887,Hell Is Other People,This show is so creepy and the characters are so amazing! Fell in love with Lee Dong-Wook completely..... his character is the absolute best! I was grinning every time he was on screen and even though he was not the protagonist - I was rooting for him... I was watching the entire show waiting for him to smile one more time... Does that make me a psycho too??
7888,Hell Is Other People,"The revelation at the end was amazing. This show is comparable to the show MindHunter in how it shows the perspective of psychopaths/murderers. Great show, you will not be disappointed."
7889,Hell Is Other People,"Plot holes:
1) The new guy that suddenly appears asking for phone charger. Then going back to his room and we spotted he has plenty of charger on the table? So, what that scene supposed to tell us?

7891,Hell Is Other People,"One of the best thriller of 2019.
This drama is amazing with everythinglike; Plot,Story,Background Music & Casting. The 'Goblin' sensation Lee Dong Wook wil be seen in an avatar which is never seen before in big screen. A must watch drama for thriller lovers.
There are some gruesome scenes, so watch at your own risk.
Enjoy Watching......"
7892,Hell Is Other People,This series was so scary that I had to look on u-tube to see the real actors interviewed. As good as Alfred Hitchcock films but more scary. The ending has a twist that makes it even creepier.
7893,Hell Is Other People,"Series could have been much better, the most I hated in this one is the main character acting.i just hated it to the core. He is an pathetic actor.first time I hated a korean actor. He doesn't have right to be an actor according to me. He spoiled this series.and story can be little bit more logical..too many plot holes.and one more thing I was annoyed about that is korean detectives that useless and don't want to work even if their own detective is missing, that is wat makers are showing."
7894,Hell Is Other People,Really enjoyed it from start to finish it was also funny at some parts my favorite character is the laughing guy only issue i have with it is the ending was absolutely terrible i would still recommend watching it though it was an enjoyable experience in my case.
7895,Hell Is Other People,I loved this show. I was gripped the entire way through. Very interesting plot. Find it weird how weapons are blurred but it doesn't spoil the show in the slightest. 100% would recommend.
7896,Hell Is Other People,Every episode had me on the edge of my seat. Lee DongWook was pretty creepy.
7897,Hell Is Other People,It has a great start but ending disappointed me.. Lot of things didn't make sense.. Great acting though...the background music made it so intriguing!
7898,Hell Is Other People,"Korean movie industry is very good at adapting European movies into their local yarns and give them some local flavors without being 100% ripoff. This year we got ALIVE which is quite inspired by a French zombie movie, The Night Eats the World. And now we have Strangers from Hell, which deftly combined Rosemary's Baby and Naboer. But here the writer couldn't come up with a good ending on his own, so it ended in a quite mediocre way like this."
7899,Hell Is Other People,I absolutely loved this so much that this is my first ever IMDB review! Started watching this on a whim and I was obsessed after the first couple of episodes. The acting is absolutely incredible in this and the plot line is truly original. Definitely a 10 from me!
7900,Hell Is Other People,"Throughout most of this, my hand was over my open mouth. It's utterly shocking and terrifying in a way that's similar to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre film.
I've watched (and loved) tonnes of k dramas and Korean films and this has the narrative punch of Oldboy, none of the innocence of Mr Sunshine and the familiar frustration of an overall inept police force.
Absolutely incredible cinematography, soundtrack and casting. I absolutely loved it (but I had to watch it in the morning only with tea and toast because it was so disturbing!!!!) Aggggghhh the twins and the pervert. Mother of God! I shudder....
Don't miss this."
7901,Hell Is Other People,"This is one of the creepiest S. Korean horror/murder mystery I have ever seen, had a lil bit of comedy too so it wasn't too dark. Definitely a good watch"
7902,Hell Is Other People,"Definitely keeps you at your toes every time the main character steps into the goshiwon residence. The music, camera angles are always on point and makes you feel that you are always being watched all the time. I wish there were more stories to explain each character in the residence and how Mrs Um scouted and nurtured Mu joe to become who he is today."
7903,Hell Is Other People,"It's good horror show to binge watch and has a major plot twist in the end was so surprised but it was so good. I recommend this to people who like horror, thriller, crime, and psychological. But it is not a supernatural."
7904,Hell Is Other People,"Another korean masterpiece!! The creepiest tv series I've ever watched!!
The twist at the end gave me a watch-gasme!!
No one can portray those characters like Korean actors!!
A must watch creepy tv series !!"
7905,Hell Is Other People,"I found this title as I was searching for ""what to watch after Squid Game"". My second Korean series didn't disappoint me. EP1 didn't pull me in, but from EP2 and on, I was totally in. By the final episode, I was so addicted that I had to rewatch it right away, which made me bump up the rating from 8 to 9.I loved the ending. It really justified a lot of things that I thought were strange or repetitive in previous episodes. Lee Dong Wook was perfect for this psychopath character, a pale face, soulless eyes, yet so beautiful and magnetic. Everyone ends up getting mesmerized, frightened by him and doing as he says. If Satan really exists, I think he has to be enchanting like him in order to lure people, right?This series was obviously made for a Korean conventional TV network, so it's pretty clean graphically. Although the subject and visual are super creepy, murders are not shown in your face and all gruesome objects are blurred, which was kind of laughable even to a squeamish person like me. I wished that they had done a little bit of editing for Netflix viewers. If it wasn't for the main character thinking out loud for every little obvious thing and redundant flashbacks, this series could've been so much better. I've heard rumors about a prequal on Moon-Jo in the works. I hope it's true."
7906,Hell Is Other People,"From start to finish, the show was incredibly well pieced together. The main setting at them goshiwon really captured the creepy feeling of someone watching you at every moment. From Lee Dongwook creepily staring through a small hole in the wall to the camera panning over / through walls, you felt like another person peeping into hell. At certain points you pitied the characters, regardless of their ""morals"" (which it seemed every character was twisted). Some parts of the show are confusing leaving me with unanswered questions, but doesn't that just add to the suspense? The last episode is a long and bumpy ride leaving me wide-eyed and honestly begging for a season 2!Overall, it's a binge-worthy show that will leave you feeling all sorts of different emotions. Dramas like this are a big harder to come by specifically because of how swift-paced the show is. No long and boring introduction to the plot, no gaps between conflict, and nothing unnecessary to the plot. Even the soundtrack is amazing!"
7907,Hell Is Other People,"Personally, I don't really watch thiller, dark korean drama but Stranger From Hell was a whole new world experience for me. I've seen the webtoon and honestly the series itself was such a satisfying finisher for me. The plot, scenes, place, casts and soundtracks are all great. All of them is a perfect match and brought a special treatment about a group of psychopath that you didn't know what are their true motive until you finish all of the episodes. I still remember my pure reaction when they are about to kill someone, it's giving the fear on the back of my spine. Seriously recommended for people who love mystery and great plot."
7908,Hell Is Other People,"This show is really different from what we use to see in Korean dramas,the cast is really good I actually liked every character, maybe sometimes I felt they were a little over the top but great nevertheless, the ending I think they could have gone further with a creepy storyline it's supposed to be ambiguous probably but I personally would've preferred a risky-er ending"
7909,Hell Is Other People,I have seen many psychological thrillers before and i found this one to be the creepiest and atmospheric with suspense music at the right times.. The character building and the acting was superb.. I literally loved the character of Seo Moon-jo.. Though it had some unexplained loose ends and dragged towards the end still its a superb intriguing show a must watch!
7910,Hell Is Other People,"The main character did not do what 99% of us would have done. Like not keeping going back, not sharing with friendly cop. It got so annoying that after 6 episodes or so, I was hoping the ""good guy"" would just get an axe in the head for being so naive."
7911,Hell Is Other People,"Its one of the best thriller series of all time.
I thought SIGNAL was the best thriller series I ever watched. But this was also awesome.
I saw other language thrillers, but they were never this intense.
Story, screenplay, acting,.... everything was good.
Korean thrillers are best
Now a days, movies within 2 hours can't keep us engaging. But not these series. Every episode has intense/engaging scenes"
7912,Hell Is Other People,"If you enjoy watching psychological triller series, Stranger from Hell is definitely for you. If you don't like this kind of genre, just skip it.I have read some reviews about Strangers from Hell. Some people mentioned that they don't like the ending. But, for me, the ending is naturally perfect. That's why I give 10/10 rating. 🔥Characters development, script, acting are so good. The settings and atmosphere of the series will give you creepy feeling. One of the best trillers ever!"
7913,Hell Is Other People,"Once again I'm impressed with the acting level of Lee Dong Wook. This man is just amazing. He is really a good actor and can easily adapt with any character. First in Goblin as grim reaper, as a Doctor in Life and now as a serial killer in this drama. This is too tough to adapt any character but he did it very well."

There is dialogue that the main character invite the neighbour get bath together. Gay?
Bad green screen.
In the certain episode, there is Microphone reflection in the wall."
7917,Hell Is Other People,"I can't continue this series, the character is disturbing, full of violence. Imho this series has a psychological impact on the audience."
7918,Hell Is Other People,"I had been going back and forth on Netflix as to what I should watch. I'm really glad I picked through My List and decided on this. A great thriller with interesting character development. Nothing terribly unique about the storyline, but well executed."
7919,Hell Is Other People,"Good directing throughout, interesting characters that make stupid choices, g0dawful choices. So dumb. Really frustrates me. Otherwise ok.."
7920,Hell Is Other People,Very well written. Very well filmed. Very well cast. Very gripping indeed. Brilliant.
7921,Hell Is Other People,"The start was promising. Creepy, with just the right balance between suspense and gore. Then the annoying stuff started. At first it was mostly bad acting, like the main character really can't act anything but ""being normal"". The moment he is acting drunk, injured, annoyed or angry his acting turns terrible. I mean, really really bad, ""shouting at the screen"" bad.But then the annoying stuff starts for real. The main character starts making stupid decisions. Reacting incredibly sluggish, missing multiple opportunities to stop this madness. And for some strange reason he could not just move from that building, when any sane person would just leave their things and go. I'd rather sleep on a bench or walk around the city all night, over sleeping there one more night. Or he could go back to his home town.And he doesn't try to contact the good police woman, who always shown that she is willing to help him. He even ignores her calls. And near the end, when people talk to him, he is almost constantly spaced out. I know this can be a realistic human reaction, but they don't portray it realistically in any way. Super annoying.Then when his girlfriend is kidnapped by the murderer, he first doesn't want help from his military friend. Then he acts incredibly sluggish before he goes inside the building, even though he knows that his girlfriends life is at stake. And he doesn't even try to look for any kind of weapon before he goes inside. And when inside, he and his military friend walk super slow, and get separated from each other (why??!!!!). Then his friend drinks from some bottle he found (why would he do that?) and drowse off.Then comes a scene where the murderer stands right in front of the main character, and the main character has a knife in his hand. But instead of killing the murderer, he just talks about how he will kill him but does nothing at all. He had SOOO many chances, at multiple occasions, to hurt the murderer but he never does anything.But the main character is not the only annoying one. The way the murderer seems ""untouchable"" is mind-blowingly annoying. And not only that, he seems to have some supernatural (ie unrealistic) ability to turn up in unsuspected places and can follow people pretty much anywhere without being spotted (except for when he wants them to see him). And he keeps insulting people, but they do nothing. He even touched the main characters Adam's apple, out of the blue, and the main character didn't push his hand away or even walk away. WTF?! Who would accept that?The police woman also did some stupid and annoying stuff, the main thing being staking out places on her own (there should always be at least two police officers!). And the reporter stayed in his car, in two separate occasions, parked in a desolate area, and didn't pay attention to people walking up to him.And in multiple occasions (two that I remember clearly, but I think at least one more time) one of the characters (main character, and the CEO) closes a door without it really closing and without checking it. Who does that? And the girlfriend of the main character chats with what she thinks is her friend, but she thinks he seems strange. But she still goes to some deserted place (I thought Soul has lots of inhabitants? Seems almost deserted, judging by this series), and only when she gets there she figures out she can call her friend instead of just texting (why didn't she call before she left her room?).I could go on, but in the end all these annoying things just were too much for me. I ended up wanting pretty much everybody to die. I did not feel any connection to the main character from maybe episode 3 or so. And I didn't even finish the last chapter, that's how annoyingly stupid it got.The first episode I would give maybe a 6/10, then it gradually went down, and the last episode I would give 1/10. So 3/10 overall. Would not recommend to anyone."
7922,Hell Is Other People,"Très lent, très long, très ennuyeux...
Pas d'horreur, pas de suspense, pas de thriller, un vrai nanar... Que du classique, vu et revu.
Digne de Netflix. On s'ennuie, il ne se passe rien, c'est incohérent... Et tellement ennuyeux.
Au pire regardais l'épisode 1 et le 10.
10 heures de visionnage pour ça c'est dommage."
7923,Hell Is Other People,"Starts off as boring like every great dramas. The ending is phenomenal. If you are looking for a psychological thriller, horror, suspense, this is the best one to go for. The series is very small has only 10 episodes.
Each and every actor of the 'Eden studio's has done superb job at acting.
OSTs are addicting!!!
Lee Dong Wook proves himself in this drama that he can essay more intense roles than just the chocolate boy in love. He has done an incredible job and I can undoubtedly say that this drama is one of his best works. The intensity, the emotions he has given it all to his character.
Ending is splendid as I said.
Deserves much more attention.
I hope they come up with season 2 soon. Pls. Can they? T_T"
7924,Hell Is Other People,"I was surprised to see this series and it was very informative, thank you for your good series"
7925,Hell Is Other People,"I have been among complicate feelings after what ch this overall.
What about do you feel scare?
Ghost? Zombie? Beast?
No, one mysterious man does make scare to person.
Be care when you meet mysterious man or hiding something or creepy person."
7926,Hell Is Other People,"I like the series, never read the webtoon though. But throughout the episodes I just couldn't embrace the acting performance of Im Siwan, just too much for television, it could be intentional to imitate the character on webtoon idk."
7927,Hell Is Other People,All of the reviews are bs. It is an addicting drama series. I want to watch more like this one. The reviews should be 10/10
7928,Hell Is Other People,"Yeah, no this is a masterpiece what more can i say?"
7929,Hell Is Other People,"I have mixed feelings about this series. The story is intriguing and the acting and suspense are all top notch, but the problem is the protagonist. He is such a wimpy pathetic weak and spineless invertebrate that very soon I was actually rooting for the bad guys to put him out of his misery. If he was a teenager, his sulking, weakness and inaction would make more sense, but for a 27 year old....Jeeeez, he's so annoying. I can understand why his boss is hitting on his girlfriend. Yoon Woo just doesn't deserve her.
So, I started seeing him as a village idiot and started rooting for the female police officer who is ten times smarter, braver, more articulate and decisive than the guy who is supposed to be the protagonist. Just do that - like me- and the show becomes much easier to watch and enjoy."
7930,Hell Is Other People,One of the absolute best dramas i have ever seen. Acting was incredible. Story was so well written. Excellent from beginning to end!!!!Lee Dong-Wook's and Im Siwan's finest performance!!!!
7931,Hell Is Other People,"This is the best bestttt intense thriller drama.I really loved it, all the actors are just mesmerizing. The way they portrayed their respective characters is just marvelous.Highly recommended!!!"
7932,Hell Is Other People,Total waste of time!!! This series shows that koreqn police are so dumb..whole series I waited what actually will happen but I was irritated so much.never ever watching Korean series ever...I think plots were not well put.Total waste of time!!! This series shows that koreqn police are so dumb..whole series I waited what actually will happen but I was irritated so much.never ever watching Korean series ever...I think plots were not well put.
7933,Hell Is Other People,"Intense thriller and nice storyline but have lots of stupid and illogical action from the character. The main villain seems to have teleport ability. The police and detective are NOT professional, kinda dumb. Does the road in Seoul always empty at night?"
7934,Hell Is Other People,"Upsides:
-Some really good acting here, especially from Park Jong-Hwan as the mentally disabled twin and Lee Jeong Eun as Mrs. Um.-Building of suspense is gripping and makes the story never feel slow, you always feel like wanting more of the story
-The main antagonist and the dynamic between him and the main character is played really well.-The lovely Lee Dong Wook is very nice to look at.-The creepy, foreboding atmosphere.-Hitchcockian feel to the story and characters.Downsides
-There should have been more episodes, as the last two felt very rushed, this drama definitely would have benefitted from having several more episodes, and more buildup to the finale, more mental decline of Jong Woo as Moon Jo kept messing up his life.-Too much time is wasted on pointless scenes of Jong Woo's and his girlfriend's co-workers and bosses making small talk.-Moon Jo should have had more scenes. Lee Dong Wook has second billing in this, but it felt like he didn't have enough screen time.-Should have elaborated more on the backstory of Moon Jo, Mrs Um and the twins, how those kids came to be in her care and how she messed them up so they became as psychotic as she is and became lifelong attached to her ""family business""
-The pervert should have been killed off (by Moon Jo or Mrs Um) much earlier as there was really no point in him being in later episodes.-Siwan tending to over-act in certain scenes that breaks immersion.-Final showdown between Jong Woo and Moon Jo was rushed and should have been better coreographed instead of Moon Jo just pushing him around for five minutes before somehow getting cut in a second.-Moon Jo should have killed Jong Woo's girlfriend, it would have made a lot more sense and added more to contributing to Jong Woo's mental breadown.-Last episode relying on cheap jump scares instead of staying with the psychological thriller aspect
-Ending is too predictable and underwhelming, the ""twist"" is nonsensical.-""Twist"" isn't really a twist...it's not convincing buying into the whole ""Jong Woo becomes a psycho too"" bs when all he did was kill the psychos who had been tormenting him and people close to him.Recommended if you want a good thriller that with characters and setting that feel both classic and original at the same time. It just lacks in certain areas and had the potential to be better."
7935,Hell Is Other People,The show really captives the feelings as well as gives the viewer really chilling perspectives. Really loved the show and can't stop thinking about it. 10/10 on my book.
7936,Hell Is Other People,"It's like every cheap Hollywood horror movies back in the day about a group of teenagers gets to an abandoned house when they obviously know they shouldn't.This movie could have end in the first few seconds or at least in every second after but not. The buildup is way too slow and repeated that can get a decent audience to feel detached from the main character. You can't help yourself but to ask why. There are too many fillers and too many ties that are used to complicate the plot but receive no answer after. The suspense is great in the first few ep. But the horror attempt is childish.If you watch a certain classic movie, you would know how this goes. Yet the development to get there is illogical.The edit feels very much inspired by Edgar Wright's Cornetto trilogy but there is a reason why Wright uses that technique on movie, not series. First episode feels amazing to watch but after the third ep., it feels almost suffocated."
7937,Hell Is Other People,The acting is mostly on point. It's very creepy and atmospheric. The sound design fits the situations aptly and the visuals were on point save for some poor CGI at the end. The blurring is ridiculous but apparently that's standard. What I really didn't enjoy was the ending. The series started off with a lot of suspense and character building. Slowly some characters are left out and there are too many loose ends left unexplained. The show dragged on towards the end and I found myself trying to get through it rather than actually looking forward to watching it. The ending was very disappointing. Very ambiguous and some will say that you just didn't understand it or it's up to you to decide. I personally think it's lazy writing but hey that's me. Watch it for yourself!
7938,Hell Is Other People,"I have watched many Korean series in the past couple of years and nearly all have been very satisfying. I usually use the IMDB rating as a guide as to whether a show is worth watching. This one was horribly way off the mark.The first episode probably should have been a warning with super-annoying characters being introduced and a main character who is a complete moron for not getting out of the residence in the first place.Then there is the issue of one of the other major characters always turning up out of the blue and always just at the right time! It became way too coincidental and made me shake my head in disbelief that viewers could be expected to take this show seriously. I just finished watching the last episode and I still can't work out the motive for all the carnage that occurs.In summary, this was one of the worst Korean shows I have ever seen and my advice would be to avoid it at all costs."
7939,Hell Is Other People,"I'm watching Kdrama for over 8 years now and I can sincerely say that this is the best one I've ever seen. It has a really good actors and actresses, has a good script and the atmosphere in this series is smt else I swear. If you like to watch thriller this is the best choice you can choose"

8026,Sweet Home,"SWEET HOME is a South Korean TV show from 2020 now available for viewing on Netflix. It's based on a 'web toon', whatever that is, and I went into it with a few reservations that were quickly blown away from the end of the first instalment. This ten-episode, hour long series explores the lives of a group of residents at a tower block who wake up one day to find the world destroyed and rampaging mutated monsters killing anyone who ventures out of doors. Even worse, some of their own are infected and in the process of becoming monsters themselves!Handsomely shot and mounted, this possesses all of the quality acting you expect from Korean cinema and television, and the realistically-drawn character portraits of people you don't always like or love but who ring true to life: the conflicted, suicidal teenager; the stroppy guitarist; the masculine firefighter; the scarred gangster with a talent for torture. Interesting character development is interspersed with outlandish action and fight scenes every episode as the dwindling characters encounter one nightmarish creation after another. The CGI effects aren't meant to be photorealistic but I grew to love them anyway as they fit the show's fantastic landscape. Twisty, turning, surprising and grisly, with a consistent quality from beginning to end, this might well be the TV show of the year."
8027,Sweet Home,"The story rushes into assorted monster attacks too quickly without establishing an emotional connection with the characters or background story. Not scary or exciting if you don't care for the characters. Unusual for a Korean series to lack an emotional connection. This series has a one dimensional story with less depth than usual. Only later in flashbacks do you get to know the characters but it's too late by then. The viewer is plunged into a post apocalyptic gory mess quite quickly without enough explanation and the attacks feel repetitive and monotonous. And the gratuitous violence is out of place in a Korean series.
Visually the monsters and effects look good. The cast is good and likeable with 18 Again's Lee Do Hyun, Love Alarm's Song Kang, Lee Jin Wook surprisingly good as a tough guy and Park Kyu Yung of It's Okay.
I prefer Kingdom or the excellent Odd Family Zombie for Sale to Sweet Home."
8028,Sweet Home,"Sweet Home (2020) is a Korean horror television series available on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a virus outbreak that turns people into monsters. The storyline evolves around a group of survivors inside a residential high rise building while chaos takes place outside.The writing for this is very inconsistent. The first four episodes were out of this world A+ action and horror scenes. It was so fun. I thought this show was Amazing out of the gate. However, the storyline quickly shifts from the cool monsters to the humans hybrids and their conflicting feelings about the surviving humans. Overall this series had a lot of potential and falls apart halfway through. The series was a 10/10 through 4-5 episodes and then 3/10 the last 5 so I'd give this a 5.5/10."
8029,Sweet Home,"Korean Drama 'Sweet Home' has awful CGI, but it makes up with the on-point atmosphere. The settings, the costumes, the music, the performances, everything is and feels perfect, as the group of residence is trying to survive. However, this season felt more like the introduction, as we start to get to know each character and bond with them, without, nevertheless, getting too deep into the mystery of what is happening and why and how to move forward. Still, this season sets strong foundations for those to come.In addition, everything is well constructed, with enough screen time for each character and each storyline. The pace is also perfect for the action element of the story. Finally, the performances were all quite emotional.So, overall, 7 out of 10."
8030,Sweet Home,"Sweet Home: South-Korean TV series, mostly set in an apartment block. There is a conspiracy at work here, some state actors new things were wrong before the outbreak. People transform into different types of monsters, zombies, giant spiders, gel creatures, shape-shifters. A motley crew try to survive in the block, infighting, suspicion are rife but people also co-operate. Dark in more ways than one with the tower block interiors. Some of the back stories are a bit soapish but others contain elements of existential terror. Some great fight scenes with the mnsters but there are also tangles with marauders and soldiers. Great fun. Multipe directors and writers based on the Naver webtoon of the same name by Kim Kan-bi and Hwang Young-chan. On Netflix. 8/10."
8031,Sweet Home,"This show feels like the same kind of surreal nightmares I have after eating pepperoni and sausage pizza too late before bed. surreal, even for horror."
8032,Sweet Home,"After watching Squid Game and Alice in Borderland I thought this would be something similarly great.But when I heard the line ""Go commit suicide somewhere else"" I was like wow, this is introducing garbage characters from episode one. And of course, the main character just takes it.And that's just it, the entire thing relies too heavily on the characters, but most of them are forgettable trash, and nothing too interesting happens to get you invested.It's all confusing too, I had to search online for explanations as to what happened exactly, since even after watching the final episode I was confused.So yeah, surprisingly disappointing."
8033,Sweet Home,"Enjoyable, but somewhat odd. The creatures are great, not always realistic looking. That's not what's odd. What's odd is overly long shots of people just looking or staring with no expression on their faces.Maybe it's a cultural thing but no one really seems to react to anything with fear, even curiosity. Things just happen in front of them and they just stand there staring at it. A 10-ft tall thing with elongated legs and arms and everyone just stands there going, what is that? And then as it approaches them, nobody moves they just stand there. Its it's bizarre.A lot of characters are introduced, but you start to be able to distinguish who's who and what they're doing and who's brave, who's a coward, who probably needs to be killed by the monsters, and who you're going to enjoy being killed by the one of the monsters.Another strange aspect to this series is Marlboro Man. the dude in the suits what's up with him is he infected, is he not infected, or did he just happen to be caught up in this when he was robbing somebody???I'm three episodes in and I can't tell yet. Stuck in the house during the pandemic you could do worse."
8034,Sweet Home,"""It's not a disease; it's a curse."" And the series is not a horror story, though it is, but an allegory. And it is beautiful, frightening, tragic, compassionate.......and brilliant."
8035,Sweet Home,In a building besieged by humans who have turned into monsters which take the form of their hidden desires a group of people join forces to survive. Well acted and a good storyline which is based on a web toon which is apparent in the direction which focuses on reaction and shock in short stints. You might want to view it with the lights on as the monsters are pretty scary.
8036,Sweet Home,"The story is addicting enough to make you want to know what happens at the end. There are some attempts at character development to provide some reasoning for the motivations. It is Return of the Living Dead, X-Men and the Mist.
There are many comments about the horrible CGI and it is true. The CGI was almost at a level of a talented teenager with a laptop and Adobe. Since the series has certain level of dark comedy, I was able to look past that. I was not able to look past that this 10-hour series could have very easily been a very good 2.5 hour movie. There was extremely amount of filler that did not provide any additional context to the move.Other big problem was editing which is the reasoning for my 4 stars. It is disjointed to say the least. It is almost like they taped entire scenes and then cut out the bloopers or mistakes and stitched together what was left with reshooting anything. There are many jumps, skips and entire characters appearing and not appearing and darkness that makes it hard to know what is going on(think Game of Thrones White Walker battle in Season 8). A five second action scene can have 15+ edits and you end up confused. Other big issue....the ending, I have no idea what happened in the last 15 minutes.For some people this may be a 7 or 8 star while for most 'adults' it will be 6 at best."
8037,Sweet Home,"If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic themes, monsters, and gore, then this series probably got your attention. It got mine.Sweet Home (2020) is heavy on gore, suspense, and drama. The gore is self-explanatory. The other two need in-depth details.The suspense is what kept me going. Not only because of the thrilling moments but also the curiosity to know what will happen next. Every episode does a great job of raising a question, a concern, and leaving answers for later. This kept my attention and gave me the motivation to keep watching until the end.Finally, the drama. This series is great about portraying the drama involved in this whole situation. And the character acting is outstanding. You care for people, you hate some people, you cheer for the heroes. In the end, I think this is all about humans, even though the main problem is the monsters.As for the monsters, I have to mention the cheap CGI. It definitely breaks your immersion. You need to numb your mind to this and watch it for the plot. In contrast, the practical effects are well done.I would definitely recommend it to everyone, but I know this is not for everyone. Casual watchers will not like this series. Gore and monster lovers will like it, maybe."
8038,Sweet Home,If this was an American series it would get torn apart and all you have to do is look at the ratings of any of similar shows that have been on TV other than WD or AHS and even those are have lower overall ratings. An anti American bias by Americans taints every bit of pop culture this gets a boost it deserves simply by it not coming from the US. I love this show it's not only a great horror show it's also an excellent mystery and has spots of comic relief. The story the acting the pace and its presentation are all excellent and while the CGI is not the best it's good enough that it's not unintentionally funny.
8039,Sweet Home,"This Human - Monster related series is fun to watch. Only drawback was that some scenes felt dragged on or else, this show is good enough."
8040,Sweet Home,"9/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean science fiction, horror drama with 10, 44-59 minute episodes.An introvert after extreme bullying, teenager Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kant) loses his entire family in a car accident. Despondent and suicidally depressed, Hyun-soo moves into a large apartment building and continues his life of solitude. That is until strange things begin occurring in the building and he and his neighbors must rely on each other to survive. Something is causing people to turn into horrible, blood thirsty, destructive monsters and it is hard to know who to trust. Martial law is declared throughout South Korea but this little micro chasm of humanity must endure and fight both the monsters within as well as out.Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kang). A teenager who lost the will to live after losing his entire family, finds himself in a hell like existence where humans turned monster roam about and it is hard to know who to trust. Winds up becoming part monster but is able to control it giving him superhuman powers.Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook) no one is quite sure who he is but he is willing to do what others will not and punish evil doers as he sees fit. He looks rough and gangster like in appearance with a heavily scarred face. He is abnormally strong and ruthless.See Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young) a character created for the drama (not webtoon) she is an expert martial artist who served in special forces and was also a fire fighter. After her fiancé vanished mere sprays before their wedding, she has trust issues.Lee Eun-hyuk (Lee Do-Hyundan) is th self designated leader of the group of survivors whose cold rationality makes his leadership strong but cause there's to consider him unfeeling. He is a medical student and older brother to Lee Eun-yoo (Go Min-si) a former ballerina who has a chip on her shoulder as she had to quit due to an injury.Jung Jae-heon (Kim Nam-hee) A devout Christian who wields a sword, Normally a mild mannered Korean language teacher, he is diligent and fearless in the defense of others.Yoon Ji-soo (Park Gyu-young) After her boyfriend's suicide, she moves into the building and tries to keep to herself and keep her bass guitar playing from annoying others.Park Yoo-ri, (Go Yoon-jung) is a caregiver for one of the apartment's residents and her medical knowledge is a valuable asset to the group of survivors who are frequently injured while battling the monsters.Ahn Gil-seob Kim Kap-soo) he is recklessly brave as he is terminally-ill. Park Yoo-ri Is his caregiver and knows his grumpy facade hides his caring nature.Han Du-sik (Kim Sang-ho) Former military man with skill in creating weapons. Although bound to a wheelchair his a kill with weapons makes him an invaluable member of the group..
Kim Suk-hyun (Woo Hyun) is both mentally and physically abusive to his wife. He owns a grocery but is reluctant to share food even in the apocalyptic scenario. He frequently creates tension in the group.Ahn Sun-young (Kim Hyun) She is meek and beaten down as Suk-hyun's wife. The group supper gives her the strength to stand up to him.Cha Jin-ok (Kim Hee-jung) continued attempts to open the door and escape in order to locate and save her teen daughter repeatedly puts the group in jeopardy.Kim Su-yeongm ((HeoYool) is a small child (9 Years Old) who along with her brother Kim Yeong-su (Choi Go; 6-year-old) lost their father when he was attacked by a monster while attempting to repel down the side of the building to get them food.Son Hye-in (Kim Gook-hee) considers her Pomerania; Bom, like her child and continually carries it.Im Myung-sook (Lee Bong-ryun) devastated since losing her child when the baby's stroller got loose and rolled into traffic.Choi Yoon-jae (Go Geon-Han) pretends to be kind to hide among the group from Sang-wook. But he is a human monster of another sort, a Child Predator.If Movies in the horror genre are your thing then this will likely fit the bill. The monsters were definitely scary and horrific and the fact that the people turn into monsters was in and of itself frightening . That type of transformation was reminiscent of the American movie ""The Thing"" though only vaguely so. It was interesting the way the people both had to work together while not completely trusting each other to be able to make it through. I liked that there was that central character, the teenage boy, and that he was unique and that he had the monster in him yet was largely able to control it. The series was well paced throughout most of it until towards the end when it got a little chaotic and felt like a lot of people were dying very rapidly. There were also aspects that were not well explained such as why the fire fighter character was suddenly with the military at the very end. The fact that she was working with them had been revealed earlier but it did not seem like she had given them what they wanted enough that she would've been able to join them completely. The gangster guy was very different in the television series than in the webtoon where he was more of a goofy character and much more likable. For the most part they stuck to the webtoon enough that it was clear that it was made based on it and yet deviated enough to make it work in the television format. They left it open for more seasons as everything was not wrapped up and in the fact there is additional story line in the webtoon indicates that there is story left for more episodes to the series or another season. I'm not sure why they decided to only do 10 episodes, 16 or more episodes would have allowed for a more complete telling of the story."
8041,Sweet Home,"So bad that you will fall asleep. Is so slow, bad cgi, bad korean show. All the korean show are over acting. And i don't know why imdb now is forcing to write a review longer. It sucks."
8042,Sweet Home,"Imagine the most miserable, unlikeable people on earth stuck in a residential building while random monsters go around with zero explanation.The monsters are pretty cool but the characters kill it. There is zero reason to give a flying crap about a single one of them. Every one is nasty for no reason. The stupid dancer runt, the crazy lady, the incel loser. Who wants to look at these imbeciles.Pass."
8043,Sweet Home,"The trailer had me hooked, and I was looking forward to this. The show is visually great, IMO. There's a decent amount of CGI that's hit/miss but various practical visual effects were done really well. The show is very colorful for almost 10 episodes of scenes trapped inside a building. The music was good too, minus the repetitive Imagine Dragons song. So if you like to enjoy stuff like that, give this a shot.
One of things that's a plus about Korean movies and shows in general is that they easily blend genres. They make you get so invested into the characters in thrillers/horrors that the genre also becomes emotional - in a good way. Sweet Home has A LOT of characters but it takes time to get invested. But since it's a tv show and since there were so many people, i think it's okay to consume that much time.
The monsters too, are very different from each other, unlike what we'd have seen in most zombie-type movies, they too had different personalities.
The story though, was a slight let-down for me, I personally found that there were inconsistencies which breaks the suspense/tension/sense of urgency. I felt that there were several questions that were left unanswered towards the end of the show, which was also a let down, but maybe that's just me. Will there be an S2? Will they answer all those questions? I don't know, and the show doesn't end in a way that would make me wait in anticipation for S2 and for those answers. I might not even watch it, answers or not.
But overall, something slightly different to watch. I thought that it was visually really good, great music/sound too! Watch this if you're bored and have nothing else to watch. 10 hours is a lot of commitment."
8044,Sweet Home,"Some of the actors were great but this fell short of my expectations. Maybe it's because I've watched several shows with a similar premise, but this just didn't capture my attention. And I can tell that this was adapted from a webtoon because most shows adapted from webtoons end up lacking in some way."
8045,Sweet Home,"The idea of this series is great. Instead of zombies you get people turning into these crazy monsters. First seven episodes are survival horror and the last 3 are straight up Game of Thrones/Walking Dead if you know what I mean. It just gets dark, gruesome and sad really quick.What I liked the most about this series is that it isn't the usual stuff. It's like a mix of 21 days later, meets resident evil, meets the last of us meets Marvel comics. It has a lot of good themes going for it that makes it worth watching if any of the above appeal to you.I will say that watching this it seemed like a single season was good enough. I'm not sure how adding a season 2 would go with so many good characters now gone. At least for me everybody I liked was dead at the end so there was no point to watching the story further. I guess it really did hit a walking dead point."
8046,Sweet Home,"So this is definitely one of those shows that people will either love or hate. I feel like you get a pretty good idea of the tone, atmosphere, and direction right from the very first episode, so if you dislike the first episode then I would not continue watching.
Yes, the CGI isn't the best, but it's also not the worst I've seen either.
The core of this show is this group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing.All that being said, I really and unexpectedly loved this show. The weirdness of it intrigued me in the first episode, and by episode 3 I was fully hooked. The characters are really, really great and you can't help but root for them to survive. I loved the soundtrack, especially the use of Imagine Dragons ""Warrior."" I can't really explain why I loved this show so much, it was just this perfect combination of weird and exciting and gory that kept me completely immersed until the very last second. I really hope they give this a second season because there was a lot left unexplained!"
8047,Sweet Home,"I think it's well done and looks interesting but after 3 episodes I just don't find myself caring to watch anymore. It's not bad, it just doesn't really seem to be anything I haven't seen before. Perhaps it's got a little more ""column A"" and a little less ""column B"" but it doesn't feel fresh or novel, which isn't in and off itself a bad thing, and I've seen enough of this ilk to not need to see more at this point."
8048,Sweet Home,"Katana oppar is daddy af. But seriously, The concept is actually pretty strong, mutated monsters with unique skills is interesting, but the story is just bleh and the sfx is passable. It's pretty obvious they want to make this into a long run series so everything just feels dragged so bad, you can skip five episodes and still pretty much gets it. The characters? Omfg the characters are just god awful, the main characters are overly edgy, the supporting characters are overly lame, both have anime logic and sensibility and overall unbearably annoying.If you don't like edgy manhwa you won't like this. Also i LOLed every time a wild 'imagine dragons' appear."
8049,Sweet Home,"During lockdown and due to COVID, there is a real shortage of video entertainment coming out of Hollywood these days; as such, I have started watching foreign tv shows that still seem to be coming out. I am extremely glad that I found this gem of a tv show to watch! It is literally top notch! Beyond some of the foreign cultural items in this show, I literally had no problem understanding most aspects of this show. In fact it's better than a lot of the stuff coming out of Hollywood these days!The acting is decent. There are many supporting actors in this show and they all did fairly well also. The cinematography was really top notch with beautiful snow scenery and post apocalyptic city scapes.
A good part of this show included cgi monsters and while these were clearly not realistic, they were realistic enough for me to look beyond this small failing. If the cgi were done in the west using the best cgi we have it still would have been difficult to achieve realism in this film as it is filled with so many monsters.This is definitely worth the watch and I watched the entire series binge style over a two day period. 8/10 is a great rating for a non western show! See this!"
8050,Sweet Home,"Just finished watching this show. I must say , at first I was thinking hmm should I actually watch this. Then I gave it a go and didn't regret at all. Loved the characters, music, the gore element, tonnes of blood thrown in ,with a great story and some over the top monster action.
I am sure they have to come up with Season 2 now. Watch this you won't regret, something different on TV rather than the usual boring PC stuff."
8051,Sweet Home,"I can give max 6.5/10 only because the idea of different monster types are only copies from many movies and dramas. The story is just average, nothing to brag on and similar stories to all same types of dramas and movies.They should make better dramas from new stories and not just copied from others.I dont suggest to pay for this dramas because they are so many other better dramas."
8052,Sweet Home,"The story arc and plot are random and chaotic. Whatever seems to fit at the moment. The scene cuts were spasmodic. But it was engaging enough for me to watch to the end, even though I was debating whether to continue a few episodes in. Once I got use to the whatever-goes mentality, I could enjoy it."
8053,Sweet Home,"Quite truthful to the original story. They didn't wrapped thing so much, so that's good too.
CGI are ok, acting is good, filming is really good."
8054,Sweet Home,"It's good, but forgettable. Some much exciting parts, but there's much filler and long flashbacks that is not really necessary. Not anxious for a second season, but I'd watch."
8055,Sweet Home,I really love this series so far the monsters are creepy and very frightening in the whole plot is just awesome. You have to check it out you have to see it to believe it. Best Asian horror series I've seen in a long long time.
8056,Sweet Home,"This is better than most English language horror/monster shows by far the characters might not be incredible but the production value and monster design is incredible I've not seen anything this good looking outside of American cinema even the monsters in stranger things look terrible compared to this.
Even if you hate reading subtitles or whatever this rises above the rest it doesn't drag there's not too much talking so give it a go."
8057,Sweet Home,"The ideas and premise shown in Sweet Home aren't new. You have people turn into monsters and basically causing the end of the world as we knew it. I like the idea of how the humans are turning and being affected in different ways by this I guess you may call it possession.Unfortunately the execution makes it all feel completely fake. It's not just the CGI that makes it look fake. It's also how the transformation happens, how people act and even the changes themselves.Just to give a quick example on why this feels fake. Even though it isn't said when exactly it's happening towards the end of the first season we can see it starting to snow. So it plays around late autumn and early winter. This means usually it's rather cold outside. Except for one comment made by a kid no one ever refers to it being cold outside or how winter and snow may affect them. Winter in an apocalyptical event is usually a pretty serious issue. Here it's not even considered.In general food and water seem to be just some minor inconvenience that are also only mentioned once and then never again.The show is focused on human interaction and drama and unfortunately fails there too as the characters aren't feeling real for the most part and I'd call them one-dimensional.Towards the end of season one they also go for a very big cliché which is often found in zombie movies and honestly it's just not believable. In addition early on the monsters are established as a considerable threat. However the show shifts the focus away from the threat of the monsters and suddenly they barely make any appearances and are only a nuisance instead of an actual threat. You got to have your human drama...One more thing that really bothered me, was that throughout the whole season we stay in that one big apartment building. I still know nothing about how that building is even structured. We're jumping around between places within the building and often (especially in later episodes) it's not clear where the characters actually are within the building. And btw. with all the destruction going on there apparently was no real issue with getting electricity and that especially is not really believable.Honestly I wanted to like the show and I watched through season one within one week. Throughout it my rating was constantly going up and down between 3/10 and 7/10 because it has a few good scenes. Unfortunately looking at the overall result and also considering the poor choice and placement of the soundtrack at times I can't rate it higher."
8058,Sweet Home,"Netflix will probably ruin this like all of it's good shows by canceling it too soon. Like literally anything worthwhile is cancelled and they renew crap.
But highly recommend this"
8059,Sweet Home,"Got me hooked from episode 1!
Great weekend binge. Tension and action packed series. It's a crazy ride!
After 4 episodes it shifts focus on the drama of surviving rather than fighting the monsters (which rarely appear anymore). Overal it was a good show, with good acting and the best was the music and the action sequences."
8060,Sweet Home,"I was really impressed by the first few episodes, but series start to go down very quickly after that. It seemed like they've spent most of their budget on the first few episodes, because after that it's almost nothing but people sitting around, talking and crying. Lots and lots of crying. Newly introduced monster designs were crappy and sub part, in comparison to the beginning.I just hope, that if this show gets the second season, they'll get more money to bring in some new cool looking monster designs, rather than focusing on people fighting people, like they did as the season progressed."
8061,Sweet Home,"Just the way a horror series should be with that jump and yell out factors, I love it!!!"
8062,Sweet Home,"Terrible CGI
Boring drab lifeless acting
No emotion in the characters
And just terrible bad ugly fake cgi.The quality is just too poor to enjoy on my nice tv."
8063,Sweet Home,"Its cringy as can be and I've had friends getting me to watch redo of healer. If you don't know what it is don't go looking seriously. I couldn't care less about any of these characters other then the gangster and maybe the man building things.Every single time there is an action scene they start playing Imagine Dragons - Warriors in the background and it doesn't fit at all, its like they signed a contract to get rights to play it for free but they had to play it 10 times so every episode.The entire message it looks like is willpower and not giving into desire.Its definitely not a 6 or higher, anyone who thinks this is a masterpiece is high on kpop bands probably. I like Korean films like Train to Busan and Alive but this is garbage."
8064,Sweet Home,"This would have made a good three hour movie, but it had too much time to get lost in itself. By the seventh episode or so I was losing interest, but stayed with it until the end, which provided no resolution at all."
8065,Sweet Home,"First of all, watch it with subtitles because dubbing is terrible and original language is always best. I watched the first episode because I got bored and love these types of shows, then found myself 5 episodes in and really liking it. I would rate the first half of this show a high 8/10 even with some sketchy CGI and over acting. The second half starts to go down hill and gets very long winded with far less monsters and gore and more long, drawn out drama. By the end, it's more drama than anything. So I would rate the second half more of a 5 or 6/10. The premise is that people are turning into all sorts of monsters....no monster ever the same and at first there is no known cause for it. This show follows the survivors and monsters stuck in a very large apartment building. As the show moves on, you realize it's not an infectious disease like with zombies, but I won't say more. The CGI is sometimes great, then goes totally flat and looks absolutely horrible. Overall, this is a very enjoyable show to watch with a very unique premise behind it. I look forward to season 2 should they make one."
8066,Sweet Home,"Please do not pay attention to the people who read the webtoon. This series is perfect and I can see it getting way better in the upcoming seasons. The writer did not shy from providing the most authentic realistic flow of events possible even when it hurt. I enjoyed the lead in this series. His state of mind fits the mood. Overall, an incredible work. I can't wait for season 2."
8067,Sweet Home,By far one of the best show Netflix put out in a minute.Was a bit sceptical at first and didn't know what to expect but then when everything unfolds this show really takes off. Can't wait for season 2.
8068,Sweet Home,"This is definitely worth a watch . It's entertaining and good fun! I like the fact as it's dubbed into English so I don't have to read those pesky subtitles . Some people state that they prefer the subtitles but the translation isn't very good anyway ( as often it doesn't make sense ) so imo it's better to have the dubbing .( You also miss people's expressions and the action because you're too busy reading the subs!)
Apart from that , it's a good watch!"
8069,Sweet Home,"Another shameful project of worst content maker, NETFLIX."
8070,Sweet Home,"There is room for improvement and the story is a bit lacking, but the original Idea works and the zombie variety adds a fun twist. More fun than scary, but good fun."
8071,Sweet Home,"It wasn't bad and it wasn't good. For anyone out there who has ever taken anti-depressants in your life, you know how they don't really make you feel happy or sad? ... how they just kind of create a lack of emotion entirely? That's pretty much exactly how this show makes you feel.. like you don't know whether to keep watching or turn it off or why they even bothered in the first place.There was zero heart and soul put into this. Reminded me of a project where nobody really cared about it and they were more focused on getting it done rather than take the time to connect the story to their audience.This is the show equivalent to eating cold 2-day old leftovers from Olive Garden. Like.. sure it still tastes good I guess.. sort of... I mean I think? Let's just say it's passable but I certainly need to have something better tomorrow to make up for it."
8072,Sweet Home,"Probably worst Korean series ever watched.
Finished it in 2 days fast forwarded after 1st episode . totally not worth to watch ..all girls look like same ..few male characters look like same hardluto recognise them.plus whole serie in one building make it worst ..save your time don't start else u will watch till end to find some this lol"
8073,Sweet Home,"Nessa analise me baseei em 5 importantes pontos: Enredo, desenvolvimento, personagens, estética e entretenimento.Enredo: 2/2.Desenvolvimento: 2/2.Estética: 2/2.Personagens: 2/2.Entretenimento: 2/2."
8074,Sweet Home,"This Kdrama series which is adapted from webtoon comics. A survival monster apocalypse series where the plot isn't very deep, But I still enjoyed since the drama has its own unique side.Monsters had good designs but the cgi made them look really fake.It wasn't that bad though."
8075,Sweet Home,The story is all over the place. I don't see how this show is getting such good reviews. I really wanted to like it but gave up after 5 episodes. Has some pretty cool visual effects but that's about it.
8076,Sweet Home,The only thing worse than this show is that it should never have had an episode 2
8077,Sweet Home,Wow what a pilot . Thrilling from episode 1 . A love the video game visuals although sometimes its just bad and that monster from episode 1 was terrifying. One more bad thing is the music selection . The first and second episodes were the best so far . The third and fourth were slower
8078,Sweet Home,"Tldr; It was more of a suspense and teary eyed jerker. Everyone waiting on Season 2 before really giving it a ""Yay"" or ""Nay."" If anything, at least watch for Lee Si-Young's amazing back abs, which I didn't even know was possible. I had to rewind that part to make sure I wasn't hallucinating-lol.If you looking for something that has great Action? This isn't it, you be better off watching a Shonen Anime or John Wick.You want some Romance? It is almost non-existent even though love is thick in the air, they don't try to progress further than that.Scary? It definitely have its' horror elements, but I can think of scarier things like the 13 ghost or Exorcist. Out of the 3 categories I mentioned so far, it does this the best; while mixing in drama and sadness. If anything, what hooks u from episode to episode, is to uncover the mystery as into why everything is so screwed up.It reminds me a lot of #Alive except, instead of Zombies you have people turning into different types of Monsters; and there is a MUCH bigger cast of characters. With the main protagonist giving you Kaneki vibes from Tokyo Ghoul.Lastly, be prepared to be left on a cliffhanger, if Netflix doesn't give it a Season Two, we are screwed. Overall I think it is average at best, but I still enjoyed watching it and would watch Season Two. To see if it gets better, before dropping it. I think it could have just done better in several other categories, like the ACTION! That was the biggest let down and the 2nd was Romance. I'm like screaming at the screen, ""Just freaking kiss already,"" at multiple moments, even up to the very end."
8079,Sweet Home,"I found this series through the manhua based on it and was shocked when I found out that it was produced and created, I didn't expect something like Sweet Home to get a Live Action release when not even an animation of it had been done.And I like it, shockingly enough.Usually Live Action adaptions of works in manga/manhua/comic/book form these days I have a visceral dislike for as they're usually terrible, but this adapts part of the story well.Lets get to the deets tho, the actors are fine, they're usually as believable as possible for what they are playing though some of it comes across as a little hammy to my uncultured Western ears, it might be decent for Korean TV/Movies but I wouldn't know, this is literally the first piece of Live Action Korean cinema I've seen and like I said I like it. (well except for some of the portrayals, that woman clearly going crazy with the virus at the start giving the poor guard the rotten fish annoyed me to no end)Now we get to a little bit of the problems though.The series doesn't give time to let things breathe, the way things go in the series it's a VERY fast ride through the plot from beginning to end and in that quickness, there's a lack of needed connection for certain characters, leaving emotional deaths to be less than thrilling and the eventual end to be kind of anticlimactic.I would love to see more of this universe even though the manhua as (as far as I know) finished.In itself, it's a fun little zombie movie with some original ideas, while they're zombies they are also strange monsters too depending on who/what they were before they were infected. That's what drew me to the series in the first place and it's a fantastic story to see more of.All in all the only reason this isn't 10/10 is that quick rush to the end. If they'd let the story build a bit more, have the heroes at a half way point and let this move into a season 2 I think it would be a perfect series.But aside from that, it's fantastic.As always (without very few notable exceptions) the netflix dub is atrocious and I suggest watching this on original language with subs if you don't speak Korean, the VA's in it are terrible in English and like most things these days dubbed into English, I avoid that like the plague."
8080,Sweet Home,"Despite the all over the place story & occasionally terrible special effects, this is yet another fab Korean series. They really have got the horror market sewn up!"
8081,Sweet Home,"One of the worst things I have ever seen. Horrible characters, annoying to the core, terrible soundtrack and special effects. This was definitely the stuff of nightmares... production nightmares. I don't understand how anyone could watch more than one episode, the opening scene alone is just awful. This is just a weird show that has no real reason for existing and is all over the place. Couldn't even make to episode three. Hated this, its just loud and ugly and random. Tried to sit and give it another try, nope... its not happening."
8082,Sweet Home,"The show is actually very good oh, and goes much deeper than you would expect. Visually good and well written. Sure on the outside it looks like a monster flick but it's what's on the inside. Everybody has monsters living inside them screaming out. Would you like to be your monster, yes.....no. Would you kill? Can you survive?"
8083,Sweet Home,"I really enjoyed this series. The mix of horror, drama, and cinematography are well done. In regards to the cinematography, it's not about great vistas and scenery. It's the way the actors are filmed. The acting is very good, many of the actors are really quite good looking. While I rarely like Action or horror productions that dwell overly on human relationships, because the writing is often not very good and melodramatic. I found myself reasonably invested in the fortunes of the various characters and the group as a whole. The CGI is professional, but much of the series is not about monsters, but about people trying to survive. Threats come from different and unexpected sources, which kept me involved. I would be very happy to see a second season if they decide to produce one."
8084,Sweet Home,"This is a pretty solid horror show and an interesting premise at that. Rather than just a straight up infection turning people into monsters, the nature of what is turning people into monsters is left intentionally vague, though it is affected by the type of person. There is a lot of human drama and issues dealing with surviving in an enclosed area with limited resources. The actors/actresses are good for the most part, though there is a disconnect where some characters are super emotive and over the top and others and barely responsive given the situation. The one thing that I thought could have been better were the effects. While I understand that it is a lower-budget show, it's just that a lot of the CG, especially the monsters, felt out of place. Some of the CG looks pretty good, other CG not so much, but it just doesn't really mesh well together. If all the CG was low-budget but had a more consistent art style and direction I think it would have been alot better. Still, a pretty good show."
8085,Sweet Home,"""Sweet Home"" is a South Korean fantasy horror directed by masterful Lee Eung Bok. This show is about a group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing, so this is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it category. Monsters are unique and extremely hard to kill with some pretty terrifying cosmetics and fairly basic CGI. The series overall is visually stunning with many disturbing scenes akin to the Evil Dead franchise. The narrative is very disjointed, difficult to follow, and not very engaging, but the show is addictive and a bloody feast to watch."
8086,Sweet Home,"So it seems that the show kind of let down the manga fans who complain about the adaptation. Well, who cares.This was a fun, bingeworthy show with an excellent ensemble cast and more character development than in 30 episodes series. You just need a manga lens to get used to the silliness of some of the monsters, but as the show progresses we get less of that and more of human interactions.Still, a potential viewer must be warned that there's no explanation why that plague has befallen Seoul (and probably the world), there's no clear ending and probably no season 2. Just so you know."
8087,Sweet Home,"I totally love South Korean films and cinematography, always technically innovative and unique. The series is visually stunning unfortunately the script is very disjointed almost difficult to follow and not very engaging. But it is a feast to watch."
8088,Sweet Home,"With some pretty terrifying cosmetics and fairly basic CGI, it does create some disturbing scenes akin to Evil Dead. But the plot is sadly ruined by a lot of nonsensical moments actions & reactions that are clearly only there to create tension. It's also oddly like every actor went to the same acting school and acquired an annoying prolonged lifeless gaze look as their reaction to basically everything.... Wondering what to have for dinner? ( Stare longingly into the fridge). Watching your neighbour get devoured by a hideous demon (stare longingly into neighbours intestines). Saving your friends from certain death by simply closing a door ( stare longingly at door handle) it's relentlessly like this from start to finish."
8089,Sweet Home,"As a Webtoon long time fan, I just had to watch this, and I can say, I am not disappointed. Characters are just amazing, great representation of human interaction in specific horrifying circumstances, lovely depiction of fight from average, normal people you could likely meet anywhere, great action, fun, there is also a lot of humor, and the story is just amazing. It has horror, sf and comedy elements, but it also has deeper meaning, much more than surface deep horror, it makes you think. There is no some superficial glamour, no model like characters, but humans you can relate to and like. Story is quite interesting and has deeper layers than it looks on first sight. Granted, CGI effects are not much, as production does not seem expensive, but I still loved it, because all CGI is in function of the story, not just to shock you.Also, soundtrack is getting great along with the story.I would recommend it, and I am waiting for second season!"
8090,Sweet Home,"Yes, I've read the comic to completion. I was thoroughly enjoying the first three episodes of the show, but then the fourth episode happened and it just kept getting worse from there, I was so put off half way through episode six that I just stopped watching and I haven't gone back since.The show drops some of the character development seen in the comic books and suffers for it, the CGI is spotty, but it's a show so you've got to give it a break. Overall, the shows just not that engaging, I think it'll work for the 16-24 crowd, but if you're outside that demo you may struggle to get over some of the rushed pacing and bland storytelling.The editor was most certainly on crack because some of the editing in this is just confused as all hell! OMG The usage of Imagine Dragons is so confusing and inappropriate to the scenes it's being used for I often wondered if the music supervisor was held at gunpoint by the Imagine Dragons lead singer.I don't want another season of this show, I just wish it were an anime, but here we are I guess. I Don't think it'll grip the audience necessary to warrant a second season. However, due to COVID more people may watch this than if everything was operating normally. I guess Netflix will play the wait and see game and let the viewership numbers dictate a renewal. Personally I hope it's cancelled so they can invest in something good/original."
8091,Sweet Home,"Awesome bit of fun, if your looking for some kinda bonkers weird horror series to do with these demon-like monsters, this would be something to check out. The characters are enjoyable, fun, and silly. The story is much in the same vain, it's enjoyable, silly, fun, great horror, very reminiscent of Tokyo Gore Police. Soundtrack did make me chuckle, I wander how much ""Warriors"" by imagine dragon costed, we had a fun little bet going as to when it was going to be played. I can't wait for a second season!!!"
8092,Sweet Home,"The show's first few episodes were terrific. Great monsters and special effects. About midway the nihilism and the convoluted plot derail what could have been an Awesome series. The ending makes no sense and is clearly a half assed set up for a second season. Also, the MC is quite frankly a sad sack from beginning to end - so don't expect any redemptive character arc. Every episode is filled with people emoting and crying constantly - which works in the first few episodes but becomes numbingly tedious as the show continues to its conclusion. The actors are all uniformly good and are given some space to really shine. However, even the character standouts are eventually left stranded by the nonsensical script. Worth watching though but don't expect to leave the table satisfied."
8093,Sweet Home,I wish they either waited for better funding to the project or split the script in two seasons to tell the whole story. They tried to cram in the whole story along with heavy changes into 10 episodes. The problem with this is:Everyones character arc is watered down along with Cha Hyun-Su.The epic finale from the comics is reworked into some kind of military crap which is the default of every pandemic movie.The dark tone of the comic is reworked into the lines of an action movie rather than horror. Everytime something happens they spam Warriors by Imagine Dragons.Also whats up with the wierd camera cuts/jumps that happens all the time. It's like they skip 5 seconds forward during action scenes and you lose track of what's going on.
8094,Sweet Home,A good wholesome Korean horror flick that is fun for the whole family! 😁
8095,Sweet Home,"I would give the show am 8 but it is slightly hindered by its odd musical choices and bad cgi (the practical effects are wonderfully done however). I can forgive the bad cgi since I imagine this was not the biggest budget show, however the odd sometimes inane musical choices really throw the feeling off and sound design (which encompasses music)is essential in film and television."
8096,Sweet Home,"Stick with it. Great acting, great story line, amazing monstars and soundtrack!"
8097,Sweet Home,"It was hard to continue to watch till the end while plot's joints and man's operations are typically stupid.It looks many that reactions & acting s are too fake to the incidents.Graphic is good. Ost is good. But it's very unfortunate they made it as inadequate finally because of plot's arrangement, fake or overplayed actings & some unnecessary slow scenes.Plus, really didn't like main actress choice. It would be better if different actress are played. She shows some retarded acting like trynna being cool. She really doesn't fit in. Sorry.The only reason watched till the end is didn't want to make a deficient conclusion without watching."
8098,Sweet Home,"I really like the monsters in this show, they are weird, creepy and very creative. The story line really pulled me in and keeps me watching as well. I just wish the characters weren't so one dimensional and the acting wasn't a bit cheesey. I think they overdid the cliche stoicism too. And the guy with the sword makes me cringe sometimes lol. But overall it's a dent show to binge on."
8099,Sweet Home,"Read and listen.... I can understand people who freaked out in the first 3 episodes, bad cg, cut scenes, blah blah. After the first 3 episodes it gets better. It's different and fresh. It gets better and better when all the characters develop. I understand it, I get it. Bypass the mediocre graphics and understand the overall tv show. It's brilliant, it's different. I do like all the characters, and I love the acting, they have some of my favorite supporting characters in other Korean shows. It develops and it changes. It's not your typically survive from monsters tv show, it brings a different element to it. I really hope it has a second season and this is higher than a 7.5 in my opinion. I think it has potential to 7.8-8.3 overall. Each character have their own story and there is more story to come. I wish people would leave reviews after watching a few episodes instead of jumping to conclusion. I agree, I did not like it at first and I thought about it like a dark comedy but it develop into something serious, especially when you like all the characters. People, please, chill out and give it a try. Support new ideas instead of bashing on it with weak reviews. I think it's a 8.3 but I'll rate it a 10 to help with the ratings because it will turn away people, it's not bad of a tv show as how some people made it to be. I already binged 9 episodes in 2 days. Good stuff, chill out please."
8100,Sweet Home,"So the premise is interesting. It has the look of a manga if you like that sort of thing and some moments are really cool. However the story is all over the place, so I agree with everyone who says it starts well but gets boring because of slow pacing and disjointed story telling. It's hard to follow also cause the characters all look the same and the korean names dont help, everyone is like Jun Jin Jon, Kwon bun bam, cin ciun lan, who the hell remembers that. And yes the CGI is that of a low budget straight to dvd movie, but if they paid a bit more attention to crafting a better structured story I would have excused it. In the end disappointing."
8101,Sweet Home,"With netflix's budget its shocking to see bad the CGI is, maybe they were inspired by sharknado. editing is pretty weak, u often get confused by its unnecessary random timeline jumping. playback at 1.5x speed & its still kinda slow. overall quite entertaining & has its touching moments."
8102,Sweet Home,"Nothing I can say, its just Excellent!
First the Kingdom and this Sweet Home! I have another reason to subscribe at netflix hhaha"
8103,Sweet Home,"Just finished episode 5 and I don't know whether to continue, how this show is even getting at least 6 star rating from some people surprises me or does it get better after episode 6?
the plot line is such a bore and the monsters! my God the monsters are so awful, who ever designed them is such an idiot, none of the monsters make sense to me! then there's the action scenes where its like it's skipping, pathetic! you barely know what happened and too many characters to keep up with, it's like every episode has a new character introduced. so much cringe in this show.
I would rather watch romance kdrama than this bore fest and that says a lot"
8104,Sweet Home,"Just brilliant, great filming, good characters, old fashioned monsters. Definitely worth a watch."
8105,Sweet Home,"I'm 5 episodes in, I started watching last night and I'm hooked. The story is basically people are turning into random monsters and follow a group of survivors in a apartment building. I would say it falls under horror but there is some light humour thrown in as well. There is good deal of drama in the mix, a couple of times I did actually cry something I don't do often. It is very well acted the story is great so far and there is a good balance of action and character building. I recommend watching with the original Korean voice with English subtitles, I tried to watch it with English voice overs but it just wasn't as good. The one negative i have is on the most part the effects are good but the CGI is great in places and then terrible in others. But I can't recommend this enough, Especially if you like horror."
8106,Sweet Home,"I wonder if the people who rated this poorly gave up too early. I was one of them, I gave it 5 stars and moved on. But something about it was intriguing, so I came back. Ep 1 was promising, then it went downhill, I dropped it after Ep 3, but when I came back and I didn't regret it. I'm now rating it with a solid 8. The characters were annoying, yes, but they grew on me. Many dialogues and reactions seemed rather stupid, but they leaded to some great scenes. This series has a nice atmosphere, beautiful actors with lots of charisma. I liked the soundtrack and the CGI (yes, I do!). My biggest issue was the storytelling. They told too many stories at the same time. You want to know what happens to a certain character, but you have to wait, because other stories get in the way. I would have preferred it, if they finished one story arc and then moved on. I wasn't bothered by this kind of storytelling that much later on, when the series progressed. Most likely because the characters grew on me, and I was equally invested in everyone of them. To make it short: interesting survival/zombie/monster plot with annoying characters who became less annoying the more you know about them, decent CGI, decent music, some very good coloring and atmosphere. Some very good directing, some very bad directing and yeah ... Could have been better, but they did a good job most of the time. Some scenes were really bad, some were brilliant. Sometimes the action was incredible, sometimes it looked cheap or they just skipped a scene so you didn't even know what happened. It is, what it is. And it was a nice watch and an emotional ride."
8107,Sweet Home,"Got something a about it. Shame the budget, is around 10p. Annoying characters, weird decisions. Nothing really makes any sense. But for some reason I kept watching. I guess hoping it would get better."
8108,Sweet Home,"The episode Im currently watching is full of asian steriotypes roles and catch phrases. Storyline... welll will see If one will apear. it feels like more like a computer game, but most computer games have a deeper story... Up to now not impressed..."
8109,Sweet Home,"This series is amazing... Needs season 2...
This is just a different type of horror show. There are know comparisons.
I'm in the UK... It was dubbed but the dubbing was done so well I actually forgot it was dubbed.. Worth a watch right to the end.."
8110,Sweet Home,"An entertainment masterpiece. From the acting, to the special effects. Don't miss this amazing show. It's a gem."
8111,Sweet Home,"4/10 for the horrible cgi monsters which brings the whole drama down, esp since the show is based on these monsters. Oh ya, the building is also a horrible cgi.it was made in 2020, and this is the cgi? ugh!
Hm what else? let's see, the plot is alright so far. I was scared a lot. It has a quite few heart stopping moments.
However, I'm already seeing some of the korean specific trope, namely, the mother whose daughter is outside and wants to open the gate. I just hated how the other characters didn't let her go the 2nd time. Like hey man, personal choice/decision, the mother has a functional mind; she can consent. She wants to go outside and die? Let her try and die. Stop keeping her and endanger the rest of group. Alright, the first time I understood why they couldn't open the door. Heck, even I wouldn't let her. I'd fight her tooth and nails and override her reckless decision to endanger not only herself, but others too. But bish when she did it again secretly and opened the freakin door, it's time to cut some losses and kick her out of the door. She wants to go that badly to save her daughter? LET. HER. The door was open and they held her back???( I could see that plotline a mile away because THIS is KDRAMA. This is train to busan all over again when the grandma opened the door. ) I can't believe they had literally noone to keep an eye on her after her 1st attempt. Who's stupid enough to let her off completely without 2nd thought? Oh another thing, the bish was not punished for her action. Instead, they had characters be like ""oh, no her daughter's dead."" Ya, well, what about the solider who died unnecessarily trying to save her? (ya, they don't talk about it.) Tbh, they should have the mother try to rescue her daughter to give her some closure. and wth was her daughter doing outside anyway with all those mosnters? how did she make it that far? makes no sense.
oh last thing, i hate seeing that actor in the wheelchair. he's everywhereeeeeeeee. i'm tired so seeing the same face again and again."
8112,Sweet Home,"Acting is very bad. A bunch of people staring at others or at nothing, vacantly, for too long. Conversations are stupid. Reactions are even more stupid or non-existent. The first episode is probably the best since it has interesting u-turns, but it fast goes downhill from there. Monsters are very badly made later on, to the point that it's embarassing to watch. I've stopped watching after second episode. Go and watch Alice in Wonderland instead."
8113,Sweet Home,"It's Korean. So you kind of know what your going to be getting when it comes to the main characters. You always have the ""comedy rolls"" and there is no exception here. I can find these characters annoying, but in Sweet Home, there is definitely enough crazy monster stuff going on to take your mind of them.
This is not perfect but very enjoyable. The story does start to fade to the end, maybe two episode to long."
8114,Sweet Home,I like this so much. i just want to protect hyun su at all cost... i love all the characters and it was so sad when they were gone one by one. the whole turning into a monster things is a bit confusing but it's also interesting how one would turn into something they desire the most... i can't wait for the season 2!!
8115,Sweet Home,"Although full of ridiculous creatures like Hulk ultra pro max, sticky Chewbacca, snakey tongue and a skinny guy with half his head cut off- it has a good message. It's about survival. And it has 2 cute guys, I personally love Lee Jinwook."
8116,Sweet Home,"I really enjoyed Sweet Home. It's an urban disaster series which you'll think is initially going to be zombie-esque, but the producers take zombie apocalypses to a new level with a monster brand. It's frightening, funny and there's never a dull moment."
8117,Sweet Home,"What a fantastic show. It made me realize that Hollywood stopped making monster movies long time ago... it's all zombies, vampires and ghosts and nothing else now. This was so refreshing. I binged on it for a few nights.What was even more refreshing is the Korean cast... it was so nice to take a break from American ""culture"" and actually see good people, just plain simple, good, nice, all likeable people without typical annoying American ""baggage"". Nobody in this show was annoying. It was like taking a breath of clean mountain air.Very original, great atmosphere, great characters, great cinematography, great pace, great action, dialogue, I have nothing to complain about at all... it was much more enjoyable than anything Hollywood made in recent years.I will definitely be looking for more Korean movies/TV shows now."
8118,Sweet Home,"Someone wrote, don't give up after the first episode. I feel exactly the opposite, the first 3-4 episodes were excellent. After that it became more soap opera with every episode. Probably Koreans will say this is not that Korean, that it is a westernized version. I'm Hungarian so viewing this series it seemed very Asian to me. The interaction, the greetings, the politeness and manner, relationships between characters are very Asian. For example the relationship between the guy with the sword and the bass player girl (I'm sorry but the names were really difficult to me to know) is just a platonic love and then the guy dies. In a western film there would have been at least kissing but more likely sex. Or the long takes on the meaningful gazes of the characters.In the first couple episodes the monsters are excellent, but around the 7-8 th episode it dies down the story becomes more drama driven. The music was mixed, it tried to have classical and modern pieces alike. They seem to have bought the Warriors Imagine Dragons song (which I'm sure was pretty expensive) so they overplayed it.
Yeah I get it, the real monsters are the humans losing their humanity in this series, but that took away the horror part too fast.There are some illogical parts or plot holes like monsters don't die. But the first one (the women that wants to kill Hyun-Su) dies directly after being her faced kicked into pulp and after that several monsters are killed of.Overall a really good experience and it kept me watching but to be honest it was getting more predictable and flat nearing the end."
8119,Sweet Home,The whole series feels pretty much as a generic B category zombie thingy and then... I do not know when but it turned out to be one of the best series in the genre.
8120,Sweet Home,"A single question between the lines.Effective.And please, Kim Kap-Su, enormous !"
8121,Sweet Home,"The show is ""ok"" but not on the level of Squid Game or Hellbound. Some interesting characters, some not, some good scenes and parts of a good story but it just drags way to far long. This should have been a ~6 episode season. I think it just tried too hard in the middle to try and be cleaver but just never reached that point. They could have cut so much junk out and done a much better job in far less episodes."
8122,Sweet Home,"I really liked this new take on Zombie films. To link the metamorphosis to a monster with trauma in the past is a great image of depression and trauma in the real world. Really great. I wished they would have done a little more with that. Unfortunately they had some silly decision-making, a lot of tell-don't show and sometimes a little over-the-top acting. Also some of the deaths (in some cases they might come back) of characters were just unnecessary and not logical at all. Also when the gang showed up they were a way over-the-top evil as well. I would rather liked to have seen more of trauma and how monsters are the image of everybody dealing with this. But I complain too much. It is well shot and acted most of the time, there is a good score and the CGI is mostly well, sometimes a little cheap, but it is a TV-show. It does not bother me. Also the kid actors were good as far as I can tell, not being a native speaker. What is sometimes bothering me a little bit is the rules of this world. Apparently you cannot kill the monsters but they still attack them with fire and so on. Why? They should rather trap them somewhere or something. People don't have to die fighting a thing they can't kill (the elevator-fire scene). But as I said, overall a good watch. Let's hope there is more of psychology and less of bang-bang kill (probably not)."
8123,Sweet Home,I'm so confused why this isn't t rated higher this drama was really good I enjoyed every moment.. sometimes ratings don't actually don't reflect well on a show or people don't go further than episode one then rate it low but this is definitely one you should watch I loved it.. definitely a 10/10 for me.
8124,Sweet Home,"Inventive twists every time you turn around! Dialogue (dubbed) is a little strained, but, hey, it's Korean. Lots of blood and gore, and they are reincarnating monsters instead of zombies. A few characters transition back and forth, making one constantly guess about loyalties and potential betrayals.Currently finished episode three and eager for more."
8125,Sweet Home,"Aswell as great Monsters, makes this a Netflix Korean Hit not to be missed.The ending was a tad confusing, however I am sure I get it.
The only real critism I have is That the writers literally killed off every amazing character, which I was kinda bummed about.
I will also say, if you like the other Korean TV show ""Kingdom"" You will love this.
8/10 Can't wait for S02"
8126,Sweet Home,Too many gimmicks. Movie is not serious. See zombie still can joke around. Waste time.
8127,Sweet Home,"Thats right, the only enjoyable way to watch this is, by keep endlessly pressing the forward button towards the key points in the movie."
8128,Sweet Home,"This is one of those shows that you watch the first episode of and don't feel a connection to it, but with patience it could become your favorite Netflix Original. You will fall in LOVE with the cast and the extremely original story. I would literally pay money to witness this again for the first time."
8129,Sweet Home,"Im sure it looses something in translation, but the acting in this is horrible."
8130,Sweet Home,"I found the concept brilliant. Many monsters of all sizes and shapes with different abilities. I also loved the characters or loved to hate some of them. My only problem was that around the middle the story became slower. There were some interesting background stories which made up for it, but still, I think maybe some more monsters could have appeared in order to fill the space. I didn't like that some scenes were just cut off. For example: two characters were struggling with a monster, one of them was willing to sacrifice himself (if necessary), so the other character could go and help the others. The camera goes with the 2nd guy and the other one is left alone with the monster. The 2nd guy then does, what he has to do and later on the first guy joins the group. As if nothing had happened before. I would have expected to see some details about how he managed to get away and get rid of the monster he was fighting against. I have the same problem with the end. The main character gets shot at and he is badly injured, then all of the sudden he is in a back of a car. I would have liked to see how he managed to get into the car. Despite of these it was a refreshing little tale and hope to get a second season - with a plenty more monsters."
8131,Sweet Home,"It's well worth watching, it's a good show, as expected from korean horror cinematography the characters are charismatic and the show is exciting and addictive, and full of emotion, but don't expect the storyline to make much sense. It's the kind of show you'll shout to the screen expecting characters to be smarter; but they won't.I hope there's gonna be a second season, there's still many questions with no answer, but for the looks of it this may be it; and that's fine."
8132,Sweet Home,"CGI is garbage, story is all over the place, choppy editing and the characters are either annoying or moronic. How this series is getting more than a 5 rating is beyond me"
8133,Sweet Home,"In a word - EPIC! And yes, watch it to the end. Can't wait for Season 2..."
8134,Sweet Home,"A mix of terribly bad CGI, good special effects and bad special effects and a story line that makes zero sense. I managed to work myself through a few episodes but still have absolutely no clue what it's about.I don't understand the many good reviews... What am I missing?"
8135,Sweet Home,Stay for the story and be wowed by the visuals along the way. Incredible art design.
8136,Sweet Home,"I love monster stuff. I love doomsday stuff. I just love this gory, entertaining, eye candy of a show. Can't wait for more!"
8137,Sweet Home,"It's real good. If it was an anime it would've gotten an 8.5 rating. Everything about it screams anime, even the way the characters look, it's a solid story line, with great SFX. Give it a chance it may just grow on you."
8138,Sweet Home,I was so disappointed with an episode 7 everything was so good and great until It added the bad cgi and random monster battle's and what not the acting was good atmosphere is amazing like the costuming and the placement is perfect and stirring the I read this before I watched this on Netflix but the CGI oh my God so bad.
8139,Sweet Home,This show is utterly fantastic. The evolution of the characters over the course of 10 episodes is done subtly but in a manner you grasp by the time you're done. This series is so much more than what you would expect and puts other shows of the same genre to shame. You'll run the full gambit of emotions and be left wanting more. 10 out of 10 and truly hoping for a season 2.
8140,Sweet Home,BEST SHOW EVER ON NETFLIX!!!!!! THE FIRST FEW EPISODES WERE SLOW BUT I CONTINUED WATCHING TILL THE END. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WAS AWESOME. THIS SHOW WAS INTENSE !!! I'M A GROWN MAN AND I CRIED AT LEAST 7 TIMES!!!!!! PLEASE WATCH TO THE END !!!!
8141,Sweet Home,"Extraordinary! you must watch this! but I remind you, the ending is very hanging. But it's okay, Netflix has confirmed it will produce season 2 and I think it will be fantastic"
8142,Sweet Home,"There is a lot to like though, acting is mostly on point, where it wasn't was scenes where a character was lil over the top in complaining. Story is very intriguing and I would definitely like to see where it goes after season 1. CGI hit and miss some of it was so realistic then at other times or different part of the CGI effect it would seem like stop motion style and or janky animations. But good enough to propel the story."
8143,Sweet Home,"Another Netflix show where dispite the dire and apocaliptical settings the characters find themselves in, they still retain awesome haircuts and great clothing! This aproach speaks volumes of the show already!
This serie is entertaining, it manages to create some tension and despite being cartoony, you can relate with the charaters tribulations. It has a fairly good cinematography and despite the budget, they have created some elements that work well. That said, if you´ve come because of the featuring monsters, this is for you. The rest is just kind of bad. For the plot and the story itself are nothing more than junior soap opera filled with clichés and basically more of the same. By now we have seen these kind of dilemas a million times over, and they make no effort to put a spin on this take. If you don´t mind the setting, like some monster flicks, you could do worse than this."
8144,Sweet Home,"I used to like abnormal activities and creations , this series has the weirdest idea I've ever watch , good one."
8145,Sweet Home,"Sweet Home South Korean Fantasy Horror Drama Directed by one of the best kdrama directors in history Lee Eung Bok person who directed Mr.Sunshine, Goblin, and Descendants of the sun. This is a popular webtoon adaptation by Netflix. First do not compare with Kingdom series. This show is the most expensive Netflix show made in South Korea so I had high expectations but after watching the trailer I was kinda disappointed. CGI monsters look likes garbage to me, yes in this series they look like PlayStation 2 game. That's the biggest weakens in this series. When it comes to practical effects they have done a great job. Sweet Home reminds me of Resident Evil and Train to Busan. The plot is good but there are few plot holes. This is not just another zombie drama because these monsters are not easy to kill and every each monster is very unique that's one of the main reasons for me to keep watch this series. I loved the cinematography and color grading. There are a lot of close-up shots. It reminds me of the dexter intro which is really awesome. This is the most aggressive kdrama I have ever watched, there is a lot of violence and blood. They have a top-notch cast for this series and there not going to disappoint you. Every character in this series felt real to me. there are a lot of character developments throughout the series. There were a few characters that I need a backstory for them. The soundtracks are good but there was imagine dragons song and I felt that is not necessary for the scenes. Overall this is a good show with a lot of entertainment and I hope they develop their CGI in the next seasons."
8146,Sweet Home,"(a spoiler for TWD S07 if you haven't watched it yet)
It felt more like when Negan entered on the screen and ripped Abraham's head with Lucille"
8147,Sweet Home,"I've tried very hard to like this series telling myself that the next episode will be better. However, I am just disappointed !. There's no character development and emotional connection to the characters and within the characters involved. Bland ...Just Bland!!. I hope the next season will get better 'fingers crossed'"
8148,Sweet Home,"At first I wasn't even planning on watching this because of course netflix would ruin it, I was dead wrong. This is one of the best ""netflix originals"" full stop. Blows every live action adaptation they've made of ANYTHING out the water so far you can see it from space. Does the source material an amazing justice and really brings to light just how bad that apartment complex looked to live in. Not a single bad casting call, even the normally awful CG looks great. Even when the cg is ""bad"" it still fits the tone of what the monsters are supposed to be. Could not have asked for a better job to have been done."
8149,Sweet Home,"I can believe I am really really liking this show. It is overdone in a good way. Not too much, just right. I really like what they're doing. A real comment on modern Korean society- people being left behind because they don't happen to match up to some spectacular expectations. Here we have a group of failures and real bad people....battling their monsters."
8150,Sweet Home,Mmmm better ver of TG with clear background?... I hate it when the sudden cut happen... Somehow feel like missing something... Overall its good
8151,Sweet Home,"The show has a fast, intriguing and impressive opening that really hooks you.And don't get me wrong, the rest of the episodes are decent but they drift off. It never really regains the flair and interest it starts with.Absolutely worth watching, and it manages to stay watchable all the way through.Just don't expect it to keep up the pace."
8152,Sweet Home,"Okay, this is the Deal, if you have watched Train to Busan, that zombie movie...well this one makes that Train ride, look like Cinderella. The story is intense, the pace like a rollercoaster ride in hell, the blood and gore by the buckets, the photography equals anything Hollywood has shown, even better, the fx is so good. Yes I'm gushing shamefully, but let me tell you, you are in the right place if you like thrillers, edge of your seat movies, you feel like pissing stuff. Not going to ruin your fun, no Spoiler. Go check this out. thank me later...lol"
8153,Sweet Home,"First of all, I want to say, both the ""perfect"" reviews and the ""abysmal"" reviews both miss the mark. This show is a great ""middle-of-the-road"" experience. It's concepts are great, and in the same breath, the writing is terrible in a way that is really entertaining to tease poking fun. The effects are awesome while the characters are hilariously aching anime/manga clichés. Great emotion with wafer-thin development, and so on and so forth. I would recommend you check it out, but go in with an attitude that this isn't one of those Netflix masterpiece offerings or absolute trash despite how much people want it to be one or the other."
8154,Sweet Home,"Felt like watching someone playing a bad videogame. One of the worst things in Netflix. If this came out from Hollywood , nobody would have bother about reviewing it."
8155,Sweet Home,Horrendous scrip drags sometimes boring what a waste of talent
8156,Sweet Home,Thought I give it a shot and ended up binding the whole first season.
8157,Sweet Home,Can I swear? If so this series is @u&k<*% brilliant.I've not been hooked this bad in such a long time. Literally sitting on edge of my seat upright totally tranced.I really don't wanna go into too much detail to ruin any aspect of this. So heed my words and watch this watch it now!
8158,Sweet Home,It's really good and the background score made it even more interesting
8159,Sweet Home,Netflix is getting very ignorant in entertainment. There are just some movies or TV shows that are not worth it in anyway shape or form. Rather it come from acting directing the writing the casting department and people who look for screens. When it comes to the art of storytelling and then transferring the storytelling into English for American movie watchers/television series show watchers. Everything should honestly makes sense. Nothing in this show makes sense from start to beginning to the roles that people are playing in the show the stupidest characters with in the show are the females and their responses to everything. If this is the way people conduct themselves in Korea is a situation like this was to occur. Then the show should've just ended with a nuclear bomb being dropped on Korea. I've never seen failure and entertainment on such a grand scale.
8160,Sweet Home,"I haven't seen the webtoon so can't compare them but I liked it a lot. Cool monsters, nice acting ( I cared for many characters), interesting story. What do you except more? It's all about monsters. You know what you going to watch, so if you like action, monsters, adrenaline go for it!!!
Can't wait for season 2"
8161,Sweet Home,"This is one of those films that takes awhile to warm up.... but when it does, it's actually thoroughly entertaining.There were a few plot holes here and there, but it is easy to forgive those when compared to how RIVETING it was to experience such a bizarre post-apocalyptic world. Most of the time I was completely engrossed in the storytelling..... and though the ending threw me off a little.... I definitely do not regret watching it. I gave it 8/10 because it is one of the better horror/fantasy films that I have seen in awhile."
8162,Sweet Home,I tried so hard to like this one and for the first few episodes I was enjoying it for the most part as the story showed promise but I just couldn't relate to a single character. They are mostly emotionless and just have zero sympathy for anything. It's kinda awkward to watch and extremely frustrating at times. The monsters were pretty cool and they're all I really stayed for in the end but they're appearances were way too far and few between. I personnal got on and am getting on a lot better with Squid Game (finished) and Alice in Borderland (1 episode in)
8163,Sweet Home,"Not ussualy into korean tv series but it has diffrent horror/fantasy vibe, acting is on point, there are a variety of characters with diffrent stories so they probably need more time to develop, very interesting post apocalyptic series, it has zombiesh look but its much more then that"
8164,Sweet Home,"At first, I put ""Sweet Home"" away twice, me it's hard to watch, but it's worth it, a story not about monsters at all it's only about humans, hope to authors keep on season 2"
8165,Sweet Home,"The monsters were so distracting. They were so over the top that it was hard to focus on the plot. Plot was predictable. However, it was still a fun watch."
8166,Sweet Home,"Both in story and acting, this series is superb. One moment you are holding your breath as the action explodes, then there's an unmoveable lump in your throat as one or more of the beautiful characters as killed, then, without warning, you are smiling or even laughing!Visual effects are second to none, every actor is top class and the plot is a mindtwister! If this is not renewed for at least a second season, then may all at Netflix suffer the fate of Ms An!"
8167,Sweet Home,"I watched this on Netflix with subtitles and the original dialogue. I can't comment on dubbing other than don't use it for anything, ever.It's an interesting take on the zombie/monster genre. But if you get interested by the first few episodes you might later regret feeling the need to stick through and see how it ends. By the last few episodes I was losing interest. Several characters are intolerable. Some likable characters are sidelined. Some events are over the top to the point that it's frustrating. It sometimes goes too far on pointless shock value, and other times not far enough. It's not a terrible show if you're looking for monster/horror/apocalypse/survival, but I found it getting old by the end."
8168,Sweet Home,"Man, this show was something, I definitely recommend it to every horror fan out there. It's a fresh take on the tired zombie-siege formula with a great set of characters, great performances ans most importantly fantastic monster designs used in creative set-pieces.If I would have rated this after the first 3 episodes, this would have been an easy 9, unfortunately the show can't keep the pace and sharp writing of it's opening up and deflates to an extend. The best monsters and set-pieces are delivered up-front, while we are getting more character focuses later on. This by itself wouldn't have been bad, since the human stories are good ones and the investment in the peoples fates is definitely there, but the show really struggles to move the plot along after things settle. The writers really struggle to give people something to do and random side quests pop-up that are almost immediately dropped after an anti-climatic resolution. There is also a weird editing structure at place I never got used to, where the show would give us flashbacks to past conversations or basically extended versions of prior scenes where something was said or done, that only becomes immediately relevant after the flashback. There seems to be no faith in the audience to keep track of character motivations and relationships over multiple episodes.
Also rules are very inconsistent, first it's a big deal that monsters can't be killed, plenty of monsters are killed. Wearing headphones should alert you to monsters presence, people with headphones get jumped by monsters all the time and so on...Lastly, it becomes a pity party quite often, I was worried the besieged apartment building would sink in the lake of tears generated by the people trapped inside. It is standard for Asian cinema, but still a bit too much some times.That sound overly negative, but make no mistakes, the show is good overall, you come for the monsters, you stay for the survivors. The creature design is great throughout, the CGI holds up most of the time (whit a couple of bad shots, mainly involving a hulking monstrosity) and the practical effects are top notch like the overall production value. If we get a second season I hope the overall plot is paced much better and the emotions will be dialed back a bit"
8169,Sweet Home,"I settle back to watch a Korean webtoon based apocalyptic horror TV series (released on Netflix on December 18, 2020) and confusedly hear the lead in score of ""Dies irae"" (which is something like a 17th century Latin based Requiem Mass). Not a Korean score - oh wait... it is... arranged by Cho Yoon Jung? So, this is why I watch foreign films. It broadens my perspective.I have low expectations in regard to this particular genre - but, I am pleasantly surprised, entertained and impressed.There is some very good acting in some well written and directed roles. For example, Lee Do-hyun as Lee Eun-hyuk the accepted leader of a building's survivors.
Another example, Lee Si-young as Seo Yi-kyung, a former firefighter.
I could list a dozen more.A problem are the character roles thrown in for comedic relief which are horribly conceived and delivered. If those roles had been rewritten as dramatic roles the series would have been better. The child roles were atrocious. For some reason the children typically shouted their dialogue.I think I am not familiar with Korean culture and perhaps I do not understand the acting. For example, when the characters would do a hysterical sequence it always came across as whiny-screaming (I listened with Korean audio and English subtitles). Perhaps that is how individuals act hysterically in Korea? Maybe I should listen to the English actors dub and see if that comes across better for an American?Regardless, the series is surprisingly entertaining and I think individuals who enjoy this genre will enjoy Sweet Home."
8170,Sweet Home,"I couldn't get into this show until the second episode, and the CGI is awful. However, starting with the second episode, this show becomes quite gripping. There is a particularly horrific scene in which a child is killed in front of her mother. The actress who plays the mother of the child deserves an award for her amazing performance. Part of what makes this show riveting is that it's not afraid to put characters who are children in peril and the show makes you genuinely afraid that a child could be killed. Also, it's refreshing that the evil creatures are monsters for a change instead of zombies. However, I have to deduct a point for a boring first episode and another point for awful CGI."
8171,Sweet Home,"I was so impressed with the first couple of episodes!
Didn't expect anything and loved the wierd, quirky residents of the building. And then the monster came - and man are they awesome!! Totally could see it as a video game ala Resident Evil or Silent Hill.
BUT around half way through it felt like they had fired all their good shots - less monsters, and mainly people sitting around /talking /crying or fighting each other. (maybe they were out of budget?!)
10* for the first half and 5-6* for the second.All together still very watchable"
8172,Sweet Home,"The acting and special effects are great, top notch"
8173,Sweet Home,"I would rate this lower, but it was at least a fun show to watch. Sweet Home is a Netflix series based on the famous Webtoon 'Sweet Home'. Now I haven't finished reading the Webtoon, but from what I have read it is much better than this. From the same creator as 'Bastard', one of my favourite Web series, it's hard to see his work being vandalised with this ""bastardised"" live adaptation.Now it isn't all bad, the show is at least fun and creative. The start of the show was good for the most part, but already from the start the monsters looked a bit silly, and the acting was oddly overdone. Then we start to see a bit of divergence in storytelling compared to its source material; while not always a bad thing, with The Shining being one of my favourite movies - which diverged so much from the book, this is another good example of ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it"". The show introduces monsters with barely any explanation of their backstories or the reason they are the way they are. This is annoying as the manhwa clearly illustrates each character and monster and their purpose and reasoning for existing. This gets you invested and explains the weirdness of what's going on. While they do this with some monsters, some of the weirder ones like the charger from ""Left4Dead 2"" who always says ""protein"" or the Usain Bolt zombie having 0 explanation coke across as the dumbest designs in the whole show, despite being the most intensely interesting ones in the book.It doesn't help not explaining things, but it gets worse with how disjointed scenes are. I genuinely felt like I was accidentally skipping episodes with how shitty the overall pacing, where you have one character being chased down being spliced next to him being safe. It leaves me more confused than I need to be. What's worse is that they also fill in the rushed pacing with blank stares and drawn out scenes that in the manhwa existed for a page usually. There are some key moments in the book that were handled so well because of the tension created, but in the Netflix adaptation scenes would be spliced with non-essential scenes that would completely break up the flow and tension.The overall feeling of emptiness, tension, sadness, horror that was created by the book is completely ruined by the over-dramatic acting and the poorly slapped on ""Imagine Dragons Warriors"" song that wouldn't stop playing. With scenes dragged out, dumb looking monsters, disjointed script writing, and what felt like a completely different story being screwed onto the ending, I can't see why you'd want to waste your time with this. It's fun, but in the mindless-bed-ridden-mood kinda way."
8174,Sweet Home,"I wanted to watch something to keep me entertained, and this definitely kept me entertained. I finished all 10 episodes in two days. Some people will nitpick every little flaws but I loved the characters, the action and the special effects. If you're into long drawn out storyline with character development, just stick with the walking dead, but if you're into a good apocalyptic action shows/movies, then this may be for you. You may also want to check out ""Kingdom"" (Korean zombie action drama). Very good!
I'm really hoping for a second season to ""Sweet Home""!"
8175,Sweet Home,"I'll start off by saying that I'd never even heard of the source material going into this show, so everything I say is based strictly on the 10 episodes released thus far. In a nutshell, Sweet Home is best enjoyed with your brain turned half way between off and on.I'll start off with the positives1) I was never bored while watching Sweet Home - I feel like this is a show about moments than an complex story. First and foremost, a show needs to be entertaining, and the writers, and performers, did a good enough job of keeping me entertained and interested from episode to episode.2) Some of the monster designs were spectacular - I love nothing more than seeing practical effects and make-up bring monsters to life. While some of the monsters suffer from terrible CGI being used to bring them to life, some of the designs really stood out as something else.3) There are some moments of genuine emotion - In the earlier episodes, there were some moments that legitimately had me feeling sympathy for the characters, which is incredibly important for making me care about them.Now for the negatives1) Incredibly confusing scene to scene editing - there are scenes in Sweet Home that were literally seconds apart that had me asking myself ""did I black out for a few minutes or something?"". With out spoiling things, characters go from having a conversation in one scene, to on the verge of death from a medical complication in the very next scene. In another scene a character is fighting a monster, the focus shifts to another scene, and that same character just shows up later, no explanation of how they escaped their situation. In some episodes it literally feels like there are scenes missing.2) Bewildering musical choices -The original score is really solid, and fits well (overall) with the show. However, they must have paid through the nose for that Imagine Dragons song, because it gets used a lot. There was even a very emotional scene that was ruined because they slapped this song over the scene for seemingly no reason.3) Seemingly random character deaths - Again, I haven't read the source material, but I can't imagine some of the characters died the same way as they did in the show. I understand that, realistically, people would seemingly die at random in a situation like this, but it doesn't make for the best story. Typically in a story, a major character is killed at the end of their arc or to build emotion/hatred towards a villain. There were two pretty quick major character deaths in the show that left me more baffled than angry at the person who killed them. If I'm left confused and underwhelmed by a major character death, then you've more or less killed them off for nothing.4)Chekhov's gun... or monster - without spoilers, there is a monster that appears to be unique because it acts differently from the other monsters that are simply filled with the urge to kill without reason. In fact this monster goes out of its way to help a character. However the reasons for this monster's difference were left unexplored. It sort of left me feeling like the rule of Chekhov's gun had been broken. If you're not going to explore something unique you've introduced, just leave it out altogether.5) Terrible pacing, in general - I feel like this was due to the writers wanting to reach a certain point of the source material by the 10th episode, while still fitting as many of the scenes and moments from the source material in as possible. I think they would have been better off either taking things a little more slowly, or leaving some parts out. Nothing kills a story faster than bad pacing, and this show has some of the worse I've ever seen.To sum up, despite my negative sounding review, I actually really enjoyed watching Sweet Home (when I didn't think too much about it), and I might even give it a second watch down the line. I'm interested to see if, and how, the story continues - they clearly left some cliffhangers in there. I'd really like to see what to world of Sweet Home is like outside of that one apartment building."
8176,Sweet Home,"Yeah, GJ to our Korean movie-makers. Effects & montage are fine, horror component is a fact, with proper thriller and stuff. I know you 're most likely gonna' like the series, especially if you like the horror, thriller & action genre. Tbh, it wasn't exactly in my type of movies. WIth this I mean, I really 'd feel better if there was more monster action as the drama, the interpersonal relationships, crimi, etc aren't among the things that provoke interest in me, but, well, different people, different points of view. You can check out the series on Netflix, and if you like the first 2-3 episodes, then you'd like the rest, too. You will partial find similarity to the Gantz movies, the feeling can be somewhat close, but I guess this is just Asian style, and it feels good. I hope there 'll be season two on Netflix to check out."
8177,Sweet Home,"I'm big fan of zombie/disaster type, loved the Kingdom. Sweet home is walking dead against monsters instead of zombies. Everything is taking place inside an old apartment building. Feels like character development, relationship building is about 70% of the show, 30% being fighting monsters.Pros:
1. Top notch production value, acting, lighting, cinematics, music.
2. Distinct main characters
3. Decent story
4. Very interesting creature design, good variety in that you never know what monstrocity an ""infected"" person will turn into.Cons:
1. Main character's go to response for a question or statement being a stunned, silent stare, lasting 10, 15 seconds at times.
2. People are way too emotional than they ought to be, and crying too much. Scenes get dragged out, trying too hard to elicit an emotional response.
3. Monster threat level could be cranked up a few notches. I was more worried at a later point in time when our group of survivor is facing a different type of threat. Much more unpredictable and way more damaging than the monsters."
8178,Sweet Home,"The Kingdom still is the golden standard of Netflix K-Drama if you are interested in Netflix Korean shows. That said, I only watched a few Korean movies, the Kingdom, and this show. Other Korean shows on Netflix didn't quite catch my fancy yet so I stick with what I said about the Kingdom. Korean movies are generally good or excellent.So about this show:
A few good/excellent early episode, but it turns into a mashed potato.
Some CG works are hokey, but creatures and special effects in the show are generally good or great.It follows the Shonen Japanese anime/manage trope. I am guessing the webtoon follows the similar formula.Music choice is really regrettable as well. Warrior, I think, is the song that you will hate after 2~3 episodes. BEWHY song is good and I wish the show just featured the Korean talents.Possible Spoiler:
One last thing. This show also features the annoying teenager and children trope that seem to show up a lot in Asian shows. It's not as bad as the infamous child character(s) from some of those old Kaiju movies."
8179,Sweet Home,"Good story, characters well built, actors with great performance, interesting subplots. Only thing left to say is that last episode was really fast but finish all the loose ends."
8180,Sweet Home,"The visuals of this movie are fantastic and the story is alright as well. However, there is so much drama, I almost laughed one time because of it. It feels like 60% to 70% of the time people are mourning and/or crying and it just takes a way the horror feel you want to have. I do think that the idea of making a horror more emotional is good concept in itself, but this is way way way too much. I had a hard time finishing the series because of it, but the fact that it still made me want to finish reflects in my 7/10 rating."
8181,Sweet Home,"Bad cgi, bad acting, bad directing, at first I thought it is comedy"
8182,Sweet Home,The initial setup of the show is quite great. Tension within a apocalyptic confinement. But the moment all the monster shows it kinda ruined everything. CGI looks so fake and backward the original Star Wars might looks better LOL.
8183,Sweet Home,"Watching it alone in the dark , omg , I'm only at episode 2 , I'm in deep $#!+"
8184,Sweet Home,I just completed season 1 and I can tell you that each episode left my jaw on the floor. It's unusual to see people realistically go through their point of absolute breaking with horror. The acting was superb and the plot twists incredible. I'm seriously just in awe.
8185,Sweet Home,"Having read the webtoon I expected alot from this series but unfortunately it failed to meet ""my"" expectations . The story was great but the direction wasn't . People who haven't read the comic won't understand how great Sweet Home really is."
8186,Sweet Home,Very good story and characters but it has an awful cgi.
8187,Sweet Home,"The first few episodes of the show had me completely invested in it. From episode 7 onwards, it lost me. The writing is just too inconsistent. Far too much time is spent on characters introspection, and not enough spent reinforcing the world the writers are trying to build.I Googled a few questions I had about the show and came across post after post - from those who have read the web comic - lamenting the fact that certain information wasn't included in the show, and questioning why background information was included. I have to agree with them. Far too much time is spent showing us flashbacks. We don't need ""origin"" stories as the characters are already in a dire situation that's going to change their personality going forward. What we need are explanations of why certain events are happening now, why certain monsters seemingly appear from nowhere and a bit more time spent showing us character interactions in the here-and-now.The soundtrack is good. Unlike some, I also really like the CGI. Yes, it's cheap but it's well done and the style appeals to me. Some of the early monsters are reminiscent of those glimpsed in old films like Beetlejuice."
8188,Sweet Home,"OK. At times the plot, actions and motivation of the characters are incomprehensible but it does eventually manage to develop a theme everyone an understand.The Monsters, although they play less and less of a role are outstandingly doneJust watch and enjoy it. Its not a western show and that's what makes it different and fresh"
8189,Sweet Home,I knew that Korean films can be refreshing so when i picked this i was not suprised. Interesting story something between walking dead Mist and Evil dead. Some really good asian actors .Negatives:Some times the script or the way people react is reallly stupid . I do not know if this is a Asian or Korean trope but like in episode 8 that one really cool character dies and the rest look at him for over 5 minutes to die without even trying to help him. This repeats again and again. It reminds me the stories you hear about china that people do not help people in problem but walk away. Who knows Still a good show much better than other trash that Netflix produces.
8190,Sweet Home,"The best show based on a manga/webtoon? No, it is not. However, the show is compelling and takes you slowly in the story that unfolds a bit more every episode. Once you finished the last episode you start to see it is a rare gem that will not please everyone. For a change i liked it kept me guessing and i truely like the drama that gets inder your skin. Characters are both loveable and hateable. Worth watching!"
8191,Sweet Home,"Everything about this is awful. The graphics, the storyline, the terrible acting.....don't waste your time. I really hope they make a second season. A couple of the better actors definitely had their potential wasted on this."
8192,Sweet Home,"I've not read the source material if it matters.The plot isn't anything special, but it isn't bad. Execution is overall terrible, tho.CGI was god awful for this day and age. Guessing it's from low budget, but that doesn't make it any better to look at.The worst cinematography I've ever seen. There were part of scenes that were missing entirely, honestly didn't it was possible for this to happen. Scenes would get so chopped up that you wouldn't be able to tell what just happened.If you don't like Imagine Dragons stay away from this show, every episode has a dose of them, makes the corny moments even cornier.And yes, show is overly corny at times and the acting can get terrible.Please take my review in to consideration. I never though a piece of entertainment could be this bad and make me wonder how anyone could enjoy it. I truly think it's a waste of time and I want to save a couple of people from slogging through this mess, hoping it would get better the next episode."
8193,Sweet Home,"The actors are doing a great job, casting is amazing. That is the only reason this show doesn't get 1/10. The main show however is slow as dirt, every episode is the same. You can actually skip several episodes and not miss out on the overall plot. (Episode 5-7 are just fillers)
The first episode was interesting and had potential, but then it's just the same story line over and over again. Monsters appear when the plot demands it and humans squabble over useless things. Like a monster that is 3 metre tall and weighs 200 kilo somehow appears INSIDE the building, despite being shown outside in the first episode, and somehow got in without making a single sound despite him having to break down walls in order to move his huge body around the corridors.
In the end you just find yourself waiting for the show to end, you don't care about the characters at all.This show is unfortunately a huge waste of time. There are many good Korean shows, but this is not one of them."
8194,Sweet Home,I really loved the theme of this series. Being agoraphobic I can totally relate to this series. It would be interesting to know how the would became cronanberg in a short time.
8195,Sweet Home,"This show started well, after the 1st episode the show went downhill in the middle. Last 3 episodes is very good which saved the whole show.If you are a horror fantasy/Monster genre fan, then this show is for you. Others can skip it. Hellbound is better."
8196,Sweet Home,"Only just scraped a 7.I don't write many reviews but feel compelled to write one because I was emotionally involved with this. The problem is it was just all over the place. I ended up loving the characters but the back stories are scant and incomplete. Sometimes aspects of the plot, particularly context just don't add up. It's doing a lot, yet remains quite shallow. For example, what is the explanation for the infection that creates the monsters? Are they leaving this for a series 2?All in all very frustrating yet, bizarrely, enjoyable too.Word of warning, i tried subs and dubs and enjoyed subtitles best. However I noticed that the dubbing is very different from the subtitles, and sometimes the meaning is outright contradictory. For example right at the end when firefighter lady (who rocks btw) is told ""your mission is incomplete/you failed the mission"".If it's your kind of thing you'll like it.Squid Game however it is not."
8197,Sweet Home,"This is really worth a watch, first episode was a little slow but holy crap after the first it really took off. So honestly just endure that first episode and The rest will just fly by."
8198,Sweet Home,I'm only on episode 3 but wow. This show is pretty dang great. I love the monster's and the characters. The music goes great with the intense fighting scenes. I have been excited for this sence I first watched the trailer.
8199,Sweet Home,"This show started off strong, even the terrible CGI wasn't enough to drive me way, but after the first 3 episodes sitting through it became a real struggle. After 3 straight episodes of boredom and a huge lack of action, plot, or character development I can't justify wasting anymore time on this one. 3 stars for 3 really solid episodes of horror (again with terrible CGI)"
8200,Sweet Home,They better release season 2 ASAP cause i can't wait!!!
8201,Sweet Home,"I'm always skeptic with Netflix tv shows. But damn. DAMN. This tv show is amazing. The characters, the acting, the atmosphere, AMAZING. Give it a watch and you won't be disappointed.
Cannot wait for season 2."
8202,Sweet Home,"I thought it was a bit silly at first and njoabke, but wasn't sure I would make it past E1 but the creatures or monsters or zombies, you chose, were shocking and scary enough with intense moments that I just couldn't stop watching..mind you I am on E2..but I find more things to like about it as it goes on."
8203,Sweet Home,"How are people this slow and weak? Makes it very painful to watch. Character build up is lacking, hard to follow... And did I mention the characters are made to look slow, weak, and dumb? If this is addicting it is only because there has literally been NOTHING good on NF in a while."
8204,Sweet Home,"Its good effort they tried to follow sweet home webtoon but most of it doesnt follow same like the comic. Also the ending totally different. They didnt even potray properly why main character fight the desire to prevent him from turning monster. He actually want to go to to his fav concert according to comic. And also he will talk to mosterous design of himself too many times not only one or two. Also in the series i didnt get sweet home atmosphere. In comic, main character will despise his own family and won't even shed a tear wen they dead but at the end he will giv in to his desire to protect all people that was with him and also in the imagination world he wil return to his dead family side happily. Tats y its sweet home. Also because the music title. Then only he wil turn into monster. They didnt even insert the scene where the monsters will turn into human sized egg and born again with no memory. So many flaws. Anyway the comic is my fav. It gave me goosebumps and also heart ache at the same time"
8205,Sweet Home,"The webtoon was really amazing and i enjoyed it through out the entire series. But when it got adapted, it became super lame story. So many great characters got deleted from existence. On top of that, the pacing was super slow, heck, even slower than a snail. The main character does not even feel like he is the main character. Instead, the side characters feels more like the MC. How is that even possible? I swear the MC literally has like 30 minutes of screen time in THE ENTIRE SERIES. Furthermore, the character development in this series abosolutely close to zero. NONE! I seriously don't understand how this drama even got higher rating than 3. K-drama watchers are delusional."
8206,Sweet Home,"Could have been good, only fails on:
Sickening stupid story
Nauseating dialog
Disgusting chracters
Repulsive actors
Otherwise is perfect."
8207,Sweet Home,"This show only gets better episode by episode. The characters are interesting and the monsters are unique, the story keeps you hooked as they reveal more and more about the characters and the ""curse"" (or whatever you wanna call it). Perfect combination of survival, monsters, action and drama.
The only negative thing I could think of is the cgi, but it didn't even bother me that much since the storyline is so good."
8208,Sweet Home,"I indulged myself and watch the show to the end. To many characters, confused, poor screenplay, bad bad CGI, you cant make any bonds with the characters. Maybe for this new generation (millenniums) who love this kind of nonsense, it will make any sense at all... Don't even bother to watch!"
8209,Sweet Home,"While reading Webtoon, I kept saying they must make this tv series. When I heard Netflix is making a live action,I was devastated. I thought they gonna ruin it but it turned out amazing. Whole story is thriller; no resting, no waiting, anything can happen any moment. You will be nervous all the time when you are watching because this is how it needs to be. If you want something slow and full of philosophy, go watch something else.Great acting and environment. Totally recommend."
8210,Sweet Home,"Title says it all. I really liked this show and am interested to see if good reception can increase the SFX budget for season 2.Biggest flaw is probable that the Warriors song by Imagine Dragons is played for EVERY major fight scene.... first time was great, but otherwise it starts detracting from the scene...."
8211,Sweet Home,Don't know how people can give negative comments on this...Just ignore those low lives and watch it.
8212,Sweet Home,"The first 2 Episodes were fun, getting to know the characters was great. Action with the Monsters also great.
after that the show fell flat. Horror got lesser so did the action. Drama was tried, but since not much is happening it got boring pretty quickly.
The characters remain the same throughout the whole show (apart from 1 bad ass which is actually the most intersting character). So if you know them in the first episode, you know them until the last episode.
Pace is the greatest disapointment here. Story was okay, there was enough suspense. but not enough for 10 Episodes. should had been 6 Episodes ideally.
Last episode, was the worst. Nothing was revealed, viewers waited 9 episodes to get at least some answers. but in greed for the next season, they revealed nothing.
In summary: I regret watching all the 10 episodes, hoping that something might happen in the next episode. and I wont make the same mistake, IF, season 2 came."
8213,Sweet Home,"I'm more than half way through the first season and I enjoy it. I think the critique that this show is a bit Walking-Deadesque is slightly valid. But I think there's far less interpersonal drama in this show.The characters are all quite different and sympathetic and aggravating in their own way. The conflicts are believable. The pacing is on point.But just like all East Asian horror, the show does feel like it leaves a bit too much to the viewers imagination. I remember being gobsmacked at one particularly inexplicable scene. There's also a distinct lack of levity in this series. The subject matter and the shows approach are HEAVY. Almost too a fault.Still despite these shortcomings this one I'm glad I found and one that I plan on watching through to the end"
8214,Sweet Home,"I usually enjoy these type of genres and idea, however this series seem very difficult for me to be intrigued about or actually entertained. Like everyone else I was so hyped for this adaptation and the cast and the director. But Instead I felt annoyed and confused at times. Also who edited the music into the action/thrill scenes and thought the music was good choice for it??? I'm sorry but it felt so out of place and kills my mood. Also the mannequin stares that lasts for hours at the monsters was so unrealistic, like who tf gonna just stand there? Like we all have reflexes we aren't puppets. For the budget the cgi wasn't even the best, surely they all look unique and cool but it didn't blend in with the surroundings. Also the characters felt way less interesting compared to the Webtoon. Not to mention the cliffhanger....ig they going for another season. Overall something I'd watch if I have nothing else to watch. Story 7/10, pace 4/10, acting 8/10, music 3/10. It didn't feel memorable to me. Sorry to the fans since this is based on my experience and opinions."
8215,Sweet Home,"I loved everything about this, character development, insane monsters, almost reinventing a genre.. but towards the end it just becomes a slow mo fest with dramatic music. Also all the monsters kind of disappear, and imagine dragons is played throughout.. Needed less music and more dialog."
8216,Sweet Home,"Storyline was incredible and a good use of effects and music to match the action, every episode leaves you wanting more. The ending left it with a cliffhanger, so i hope netflix renews it with more depth how the disease started. also cried with samurai guy dying and sad with glasses guy dying,,,"
8217,Sweet Home,Om of thw worst series. Plot is extremely weak and neither the story or characters connect to the viewers. Every episode more or less is having same content. It was so boring that just after two episodes didnt6 get courage to watch further.
8218,Sweet Home,"They should stick to 16 episodes rather than 10 episodes.
Every thing happens very fast and rushed.
May be that's why Netflix didn't put dubbed version out"
8219,Sweet Home,"CGI is too cheap looking, totally puts me off. The monsters are more laughable than scary"
8220,Sweet Home,"Firstly the CGI is just atrocious, secondly the plot tends to drag at times and down right ridiculous at other times."
8221,Sweet Home,1st episode started off decent but the effects look like a stop motion claymation movie with the budget of 100 dollars and the music is chosen very badly at times not including the fact that the outside and the parking lot look like a haunted house you would find on your street during Halloween also some of the monsters look like edward scissor hands and leatherface from texas chainsaw massacre lol it was laughable at many part i would consider it more of a comedy only thing that is good about this is the acting but even that can't save it from coming off as incredibly cheesy can't believe it's rated so high what were they watching?
8222,Sweet Home,I really liked this show. I never got bored with it. I just thought it was a unique idea with the monsters and the difference in the characters.
8223,Sweet Home,"Okay, I've been watching k-dramas for years and Seeet Home really impressed me. I've never seen so many blood and monsters in korean shows. I know that CGI not great, but who cares with such nice script."
8224,Sweet Home,This is a really good show. A little different approach to the zombie theme but it's good. Don't listen to the haters . I have no idea why some people are rating this poorly. I binged the whole show and I didn't feel bored or tired at any point. Every episode was filled with thriller and excitement .
8225,Sweet Home,"Waste of precious lifetime. Worthless, meaningless, the lamest tv show project in a decade without any storyline, explanation and human common senses. The garbage"
8226,Sweet Home,"So glad I watched this. It's not my normal kinda thing but it flipping brilliant. So different to anything else out at the minute . Really well cast, too. There had better be a season 2!! Definitely, definitely worth watching. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
8227,Sweet Home,"I really love Comic version, but this TV series is so horrible.... they changed it to comedy with total awkward parts,...."
8228,Sweet Home,"At the beginning I didn't gave this show many chances, but after two episodes I really got into it - I finished all episodes in 24 hours.
This is not your average Asian series. At first, I didn't like the combination of Drama and SF but later it didn't matter so much. This show is so good made, that mostly all events go together smoothly.
If you did like Stranger Things, ""Sweet Home"" is a must-try."
8229,Sweet Home,"I watched this drama first then I went to see the comic, I thought both of them have plus points and minus points. In the drama, the special effects and some descriptions of characters are very well, and there are also some drama original characters, I think that it's not bad. But the plots of some part were not described deeply, that's a little unfortunately."
8230,Sweet Home,I can say it's the best series of 2020.Every episode was just amazing.There weren't a second that i was bored.I enjoyed every second.It's a must watch series.Eagerly waiting for season 2.
8231,Sweet Home,"Well written believable characters that develop throughout the series, which is not to common in this genre. You actually care about these characters. Cgi is not the best since the budget of this series was not big, but it's good enough to generate suspense and 1000 times better than what I grew up with (tried rewatching some cgi dependant from my childhood, I remembered them as almost real but to my surprise with today's standards they are horrible, my video games look better).I would rate this series 8.5/10 (but I'll put 10 here to balance some of the very bad reviews that does not make this series justice)"
8232,Sweet Home,"A fresh breath from American full of politics content. It is a first show I watched on Netflix in many months. Hopefully, when Hollywood dies because of their terrible movies and TV shows, we will have normal content that doesn't force opinions down your throat with a gentleness of skilled torturers from a secret CIA facilities."
8233,Sweet Home,"Don't bother with positive comments from webtoon fans, or the bad critics, this series is really cool.
and it worth every second of your life
the ones who disliked it just didn't understand the series, or didn't even complete it, prob just a stupid brains,
I CAN SAY NOW, THAT I'll DIE HAPPY NOW !
just waiting for season 2 now, hopeful it will be amazing as season 1
it just get 1.4 Billion views from the world, do you what it means ?, it's a really 2ufh29ef9e2fo;2efjifwuf9weu just watch it or die !"
8234,Sweet Home,"Don't bother with positive comments from webtoon fans, or the bad critics, this series is really cool.

it just get 2.1 Billion views from the world, do you what it means ?, it's a really 2ufh29ef9e2fo;2efjifwuf9weu just watch it or die !"
8235,Sweet Home,"but still the tension with the characters, quite disappointed alot of them survived; ik haha it'll cool if alot of em died. 💀💀💀PREDICTABLE. END WITH A CLIFFHANGER.Rated this 9 cuz the cast r hot 😎"
8236,Sweet Home,"Although I'm not really into Asian horror, doesn't matter if movies or series, I gave this series a chance and I'm glad I did. The story has kept me interested and the actors are really good (even if sometimes it's a bit over the top). For once, a Netflix series has very good dubbing. The English version is, by far, the best dubbing of a Netflix series that I have seen. Some of the special effects
(monsters) are excellent (the half beheaded creature who constantly says he can't see is, scary and hilarious) . Well worth the watch :)"
8237,Sweet Home,"Loved it, watched the whole of season 1 in a single sitting & leaves you wanting more for sure. Give it a go you will not be disappointed. I'm an English speaker so read the subs as it went along but don't let that put you off."
8238,Sweet Home,"I watched the whole thing a few months ago, and now I'm watching it again! There's just something about this series that I love. The actors. The special effects. The story. It's very original and fresh. I am thrilled that there's going to be a 2nd season! You never know if Netflix is going to cancel a good show or not. Sweet Home, and Sweet Tooth are definitely GOOD SHOWS! IMO."
8239,Sweet Home,"I was browsing Netflix and I saw Sweet Home and I decided to check it out. Wasn't so sure abt it after the first episode. But, I continued to watch the series and by the end of ep-2. I was hooked! I just finished it. It's one of the best series on Netflix. You should def check it out."
8240,Sweet Home,"Visually impeccable the vibrant colors add a different feel, good storytelling and unique in many areas, also has things it can improve on so I'll keep it short and say I'm waiting on that on a 2nd season."
8241,Sweet Home,Was there only enough money in budget for Warrior by Imagine Dragons to be played every fight scene? Fun fight sequences but very poor character development.
8242,Sweet Home,When I first started watching ep1 it seemed slow n boring but then the story started to get more interesting n I ended up bingewatching the entire season in bed. Now I'm screaming for season 2!
8243,Sweet Home,It sounds like this was a webtoon series n the people giving the series a low rating r those who have already read the webtoon .I havent read the webtoon n dont plan to SO please just watch it for it's sake! n dont spoil it for those who r not into webtoons
8244,Sweet Home,Mind blowing series second season deserve this movie. Squid game 1st second this movie i watching my best Korean movie. So I think this movie watching every movie lovers.#One_of_the_best_series I've ever seen.
8245,Sweet Home,"Was not expecting this one will be such a good tv show, watched whole season in two evenings! Episode after episode it was hard to stop watching and go to sleep. I dont know why others hating the soundtrack, i liked it a lot:)"
8246,Sweet Home,"This show is something else !
It's gross and scary at the same time you can't help but watch It's very addictive i love it It's definitely my kind of show it's never boring"
8247,Sweet Home,"Great series with amazing cool actors,lovely story"
8248,Sweet Home,This is not only thriller. Thriller+Emotion+twist=Sweet Home.
8249,Sweet Home,"This show built up so well over ten episodes to an absolutely gripping season finale. While the special effects weren't great, the plot, acting and characters were incredible. I really hope this gets renewed!"
8250,Sweet Home,"I know monsters are not real, but thats not what i mean when i said UNREALISTIC, unrealistic is for those characters who suddenly have sympathy for something (monster) for no reason or sympathy for someone who they did spent time with. the acting of some that is unbelievably calm in a situation of horror. its the acting of some rude characters who doesn't really justify in this kind of situation. i didn't give up watching from ep1 to end. but it didn't gave me excitement, i felt more of angry for stupidity of some characters."
8251,Sweet Home,"Binge watched in a day, amazing show, last episode was slightly confusing and not pieced together well, that being said the last episode is still good if you skim over the blanks and it also leaves it wide open for a second season. This is another piece of amazing Korean cinema, if you like #Alive, I Saw The Devil, Train to Busan and enjoyed them, this is right up your alley"
8252,Sweet Home,"Honestly, it's difficult to write a good plot and script for any zombie film. Still, I think they did a great job with this. Coming from a gamer geek, the variations in the zombie were really quite interesting to me. The struggle of facing the sudden apocalyptic crisis is well-portrayed in the story and by the cast. I honestly find most zombie films too boring and predictable, but this series was like a K version of Resident Evil - in a good way. Definitely worth watching. The start can get a little draggy - as all zombie films tend to be but don't give up just yet!"
8253,Sweet Home,"This show is incredibly fun to watch. The atmosphere is compelling, it follows a lot of familiar (and beloved) tropes while still introducing unique spins on things, and the acting is solid. There are incredibly frustrating aspects to the show, which I assume is a result of adapting a webtoon. For example, a webtoon panel might have someone staring while a fight is going on, but in the show it comes across as ridiculous because they just stare into space for 30 seconds at a time. It gets to a point where you're genuinely in awe any of these people have survived. It's a bit campy--a monster screaming ""PROTEIN"" is really hard to take seriously especially within a show that takes itself very seriously.I'd never read the webtoon before watching. I did pick it up after finishing the show and I think it explains why the show feels awkward at times. The webtoon has a lot more levity and doesn't take itself as seriously. There's a lot of humor to break up the tension and make characters likeable. The show is so determined to be gritty and realistic that it gives itself no space for suspension of disbelief. Again, a monster screaming about protein feels wildly out of place in the show but suits the webtoon.If you go into the show without expecting it to perfectly match the webtoon and are able to take it as it is, you'll have fun. It's a love it or hate it kind of show and I think approaching it as a campy monster show will set expectations more appropriately. A lot of reviewers said to give it 3 episodes to kick in, but expecting anyone to invest 3 hours before a show picks up is unreasonable. If you like the first episode, you'll probably like the whole show and vice versa."
8254,Sweet Home,Well worth a watch. Can be very violent and graphic at time but very enjoyable. Hoping for a season 2 🇮🇪
8255,Sweet Home,Very very very nice web series please release season 2 FAST
8256,Sweet Home,"The plot is okay, the visuals are good, yet ridiculous, and the acting and story are about as cheesy as they could be. It's as if they were trying to go for that."
8257,Sweet Home,"I was on my toes the whole time; there was always so much going on. At first it was a bit overwhelming, being introduced to so many characters, but I really like getting to know each and every one of them. Almost none of the characters nor scenes bored me.The concept of the show is pretty captivating. People are turning into monsters left and right, and one doesn't know when someone will turn. The residents of a certain building construct a small society in order to protect themselves, and shenanigans ensue.
I do feel like the show could be a bit confusing at times, not showing us or not finishing showing us what someone was doing or what is going on with them. It's still not very clear exactly how someone turns into a monster, so I wish the show was clearer on that. I also do wish we got to delve into more of some characters, since they were great, but there were so many of them. But I suppose there was only a certain amount of time for everything, and though I would've liked the season or the episodes to be longer to clarify the plot more and explore the characters more, I feel like the show still did good enough. Either way, that just leaves space for more clarity and character background and development next season, which I really hope will come.This show made me think a lot (What's to come next? Who can be trusted? Who's the real monster here? Will they turn into one?), and it did make me feel pain at certain points. But it was so worth it.The music was also really good, especially BeWhy's OST, Side by Side. I've seen some people complain about the use of Warriors by Imagine Dragons, but honestly, I think it was fine."
8258,Sweet Home,Watched it over 2 times already! Can't wait for the next season!!The ending is a bit different than the webtoon so I hope there will be season 2!
8259,Sweet Home,"There is always an annoying character, an useless one, a crazy one, bystanders in every Korean drama. This drama has it all and it makes the whole thing pretty bad."
8260,Sweet Home,"Shows are a hour long 10 episode series. Even with a slow start the Sweet Home never lack suspicious, with eye covering encounters with the infected and constant battle of survival and trust it made for a great watch after beating my brain silly with phycological thrillers I just needed to watch something with feeling! The actors put on a brilliant show of emotions draw you in for a fantastic finish primarily over the last three episodes. At times I felt like I was watching an anime. MUST WATCH."
8261,Sweet Home,"You might think the first episode is boring but please wait cause it gets better!! It s not very horror tho, but it doesn t ruin the series. It had some weird scenes but overall it was an amazing kdrama. I really hope for a season 2."
8262,Sweet Home,"It's a while ago that I watched this show but I always had an odd feeling that it wasn't what it could have been.Yes, the CGI was (compared to other shows) not as good.The acting, it was fine, nothing out of place tbh.But the story? *scratches head
idk what the show is about actually, no clue. There are monsters, yeah, people suddenly turn into monster... and, that's it.How... actually did the firefighter woman got out so easily and was able to get a car, drive to... somewhere without being attacked by monsters but instead being caught by the military? Lot of question marks.I was angry when the prisoners suddenly killed some of the residents... and, how did the prisoners suddenly appeared? It was extremely random.On one hand the resident can't leave the complex, on the other hand the firefighter woman and random prisoners can walk and drive outside without trouble.Nah, really, idk where the story wants to lead us, no clue.Why do people turn suddenly into monsters? Probably I want to know too much but... the answer would make this show a lot more enjoyable."
8263,Sweet Home,"Lee jin wook is so perfect on this series hope for another season. The whole cast is great and fantastic
Very thrilling and each episode are not boring."
8264,Sweet Home,"Starts off well, and falls apart very quickly. The beginning was very well paced and even the CGI was pretty good. Then after a couple promising episodes in the show stops making sense and becomes a string of random plot lines and awkward emotional scenes where characters just stare at each other and cry, most of the time for no reason other than to kill time (this could have been 4 or 5 episodes instead, with fewer characters).
Eventually character development and motivations just fall apart and it becomes a mystery why anything happens or any character does anything.
Also a lot of seemingly important things happen that are never addressed again."
8265,Sweet Home,"Great acting, awesome storyline, amazing cinematography and of course genius directing!!
Addictive series !! Must recommended for pple who love the adventure genre !!"
8266,Sweet Home,"If you haven't read the webtoon and you enjoy watching apocalyptic movies or shows I think you will find it entertaining, however if you previously read the webtoon and you are a fan of it I don't think you will enjoy this.I had big expectations for this show as I previously read the webtoon, however the adaptation they did on the show is so bad.1. The portrayal of the main character is awful. In the show he is more like a side character, he doesn't have any personality, development or a connection with any other character, they completely changed him.2. They introduce characters that didn't existed before (they had more screen time than the main character) and removed characters that were essential for the story on the web comic.3. The story is so rushed that it doesn't have any impact when a character dies.4. The story is so different to the original one, i felt like I was watching the walking dead.5. There are a lot of annoying characters that don't add anything to the plot (they're just there).6. Jisu is a very important character on the webtoon (she is one of the main ones) but here she is not (just like hyun), I was very disappointed by this.7. Also the music doesn't fit the atmosphere of some of the scenes. I remember that in a scene with Hyun that's supposed to be scary or intense they put a rap, like... what? (It was a nice song but still).In conclusion I don't recommend to watch this if you are a fan of the webtoon."
8267,Sweet Home,"If you love your time and life than don't waste them to watch this series. The director is confused in whole movie if he want to make japanese cartoon, zombies movie or a movie inspired from resident evil. No story, no concept, bad direction, bad story, bad start, bad ending total waste of time and I lost my mind after watching this."
8268,Sweet Home,"I have no idea why there are so many haters reviewing this series (especially the ones who didn't even watch it all) I thought it was great. The monsters are very cool, well done CG critters, and while not all of them are original, the eye-guy and gremlin-alike listener monsters were awesome. The characters aren't all great, but the way that they're narrowed down to the ones which are genuinely interesting is really quite well done.It's not a series for everyone, but if you can bring yourself to watch to the end of the first episode, you'll have a lot of fun."
8269,Sweet Home,"I can't believe all the bad reviews. There is nothing like this I've ever watched that is actually well made. The first two episodes or so I was sceptical and didn't really know what to think of this. But it's like the acting and the quality of the series got even better episode by episode.The first Korean tv series that I watched completely and will keep on watching when they release more episodes.I don't know where all the bad reviews are coming from. I really liked the series. It had genuine, totally not unnecessary deaths and game styled cgi which I think was good.I liked the unrealistic brutality of the series. Definitely looking forward to the next season coming by the end of the year."
8270,Sweet Home,My favourite tv series in 2020.this is the best korean drama i ever watched.all the actors and actresses are acting really well.i expect netflix countinue this tv series.
8271,Sweet Home,"Graphics are not realistic, at one point I was laughing at how ridiculous the ""monsters"" looked. One of them looked exactly like a Halloween mask bought at the dollar store.The show also focuses on wayyyy too many characters, to point where you're confused on the importance of their role. Back and forth between characters, constantly. A lot of scenes had no importance nor did they add any complexity to the storyline. The timeline of the scenes also make no sense, leaving you frustrated. Overall a super messy show.Watch this only if you're under lockdown and have binged everything else on Netflix."
8272,Sweet Home,"Awesome series adapted from web toon so far, well written storyline, superb cgi.. its character development really damn good! you can just imagine i cannot stop after watching 1 episode.. how ironic a pathetic young man wants to kill him self, change to warrior who wants to save everyone.."
8273,Sweet Home,"Ceritanya bagus banget!!! I rewatch this all the time, please give us season 2 pd-nim.... You know the ending say it too loud"
8274,Sweet Home,I really loved this show must watch for monster lovers nd action horror drama fantasy 🔥🔥🔥 .....AF
8275,Sweet Home,"Hello, I will honestly say the series is beautiful and its story is very imaginary, it also contains bloody and weak fear, the characters for the first time I see them and they are beautiful and I rate the series 7 out of 10,, and also I liked the beginning and end song of the series."
8276,Sweet Home,"I'm looking forward to the rest, it's a very nice series"
8277,Sweet Home,"The trailer caught my eye so I went into watching this show with confusion and man it did not disappoint! I binged the 10 episodes in two days. Monsters/Thriller type of shows are my thing and Sweet Home brought all of that into this first season!Each characters has their own agendas and the character building was captured well that you end up enjoying the characters individually as well as when they get together as a group. The emotional turmoil that I had for the main characters and the supporting role was overwhelming. I find myself attached and crying over certain storylines and scenes and it was sooo good!The show really give you the, 'what type of a human you want to be when you are stuck in a dire situation?' and I felt that.The whole cast overall was superb in their given role and the ending was just such a cliff that I wish season 2 was released now so I can binge through it too lol.Give this show a chance! The pacing is really good and the suspense, oh man the suspense!"
8278,Sweet Home,"I watched this series because it has been a trending for a long time in netflix. It has an interesting start, but I lost my interest afterwards. I just finished this drama because I'm bored and nothing to do that time, not because I was hooked up."
8279,Sweet Home,Netflix please pick up or do another season of this show don't wait for ever to do it either like your company seems to do. This show has been in the top 10 I figured you would at least have good taste. This show is scary yet in depth with characters it's story line is interesting as well.
8280,Sweet Home,"God damn I enjoyed this show the monsters, the charecters, the conflict and mmmm that imagine dragons song just boosts how truly epic the moments on this show areI particularly enjoy that they show off the deformed almost eldritch monsters are in this show it annoys me to the extreme when we see little bits of monsters or they are hidden in shadows or dim lighting in shows so it's always a good time when a show goes balls to the wall crazy with their monsters (that is the main attraction to shows like this)"
8281,Sweet Home,"I love end of the civilization, and this is a very good one about it. I have not seen the webtoon so I can not comment on the virtues of the webtoon. Yet in the series characters get developed and the acting is pretty good. Directier had done a very good job and the screens and the palet they choose are stunning. The amount of gore and blood is not over the board. If you love apocalyptic series this is one of the very good ones."
8282,Sweet Home,This series was a lot of fun. It kept me engrossed in the story and almost did not want the episodes to end!! It was that engaging. Its full of great performances. It reminded me of Lost with everyone's backstory or arc. Everyone was battling their own personal monsters.
8283,Sweet Home,"Thanks to netflix now we see more animes and mangas. Sweet home is actually a mahwa (korean comic series, manga is japanese) so in tv series acting of the some characters are may look exaggerated but compare to the japanese tv series adapted from animes (e.g. Alice in Borderland) this show has much better actings. Overall it is fun to watch, good for spending your quarantine time."
8284,Sweet Home,Absolutly garbage series. Dont waste your time here on this show.
8285,Sweet Home,"Too many plot holes and nonsense character decision. I can' imagine how bad of their dialogues are. This is the worst korean series i,ve ever watched for sure."
8286,Sweet Home,"A novel take on the zombie apocalypse genre where the 'zombies' have superpowers. The star of the show is the set design and cinematography as it really brings you in to the show's world.I do wish the show had explored some deeper themes that were ripe for the taking. The 'curse' is brought on by human desire, but how and why?Acting is generally good even as the characters are mostly one dimensional. Character depth is mostly attempted via flashbacks and death scenes. Editing is choppy and it can be hard to figure out what's going on at times.Nevertheless Sweet Home is worth the watch. Hoping that Netflix produces a season 2."
8287,Sweet Home,CGI is laughable at best and the characters don't develope. Story goes nowhere. Please save your time.
8288,Sweet Home,"A directorial masterpiece, excitement and suspense, a narration of events in an interesting way, far from boredom, the interconnectedness of events and interests"
8289,Sweet Home,"I really hope there will be season 2...
After the last episode, there are so many ways to continue the series :)"
8290,Sweet Home,"I don't like zombie movies, but this is absolutely brilliant. From episode one to the end, it's interesting, lot's of action, special effects brilliant, good story line. It's the best series for 2020 for me!
Brilliant brilliant brilliant!!!!
I hope there is a season 2. 🙏🏻 🙏🏻 🙏🏻"
8291,Sweet Home,"Filled with adrenaline, yet sad and heartwarming at the same time."
8292,Sweet Home,"Awesome series... Must watch. Complete drama,action,adventure,emotion......"
8293,Sweet Home,"Wow! Absolutely wow!. The plot is phenomenal. The characters are amazing. The storyline always engaging! Our main characters except for those awful ones, make you pull for the human race. And absolutely make you want to jump in and protect those in need. I'm loving this so much!"
8294,Sweet Home,"I had second thoughts about starting it but after the first two episodes it just got better and better. I do think that Asian horror series and movies are kind of too much about their ""horror scenes"" but this isn't the case here. Although it has some scenes to prove its theme there isn't much attention paid to them. I really liked the plot and I loved the different details and personas of every character. The whole series is fascinating and keeps you on edge all the time. It's like every episode ends with a cliffhanger. The background stories of the characters are very interesting and I liked how the series although it has a dark theme it pays much attention to the relationships and emotions among humans. I would really recommend it to anyone who likes horror-action series."
8295,Sweet Home,"So many parts in the show were very epic, but I felt there were so many moments in this show that had a lot of cliches.Still a good watch, but felt there wasn't a lot of creativity."
8296,Sweet Home,"The world building is fantastic, it is full of interesting characters with excellent character development. Brilliant acting. Fast paced and full of action. The CGI can be better but I can look past it because the overall production is 1st class."
8297,Sweet Home,"This drama is not perfect. The CGI monsters are so bad that they are almost comical. The plot is messy and can be confusing.However, where this drama succeed is in character development. Many of the characters are unlikeable in the beginning but as the story progresses, they become more relatable. Most of the characters are given enough time to show that they are multifaceted. And by the time some of these characters gets killed off, you actually feel the lose. Another thing the drama achieved is leaving a sense of hope, the idea that people will survive any adversity if they all band together.As strange as this may sound, despite its dark gloomy setting, this drama is a feel good drama."
8298,Sweet Home,"This Show is so dumb but hillarious in the same way, that you just can't stop watching. Don't expect perfect cinematography or screenplay. Neither believable characters, their decicions or motivation nor a plausible plot. Don't bother watching if any of these points are important to you to enjoy a Show.This Show lives from its Monsters and visuals and gore moments. If you're into this stuff, enjoy the ride. The Action is mostly good. The CGI is bad by todays stadards. But all in all its fun."
8299,Sweet Home,"This definitely got me hooked! Was kinda turned off by the initial trailer cos it looked like poorly done CG monsters in a 'pseudo-horror' drama. But boredom got to me and I decide to risk one episode nonetheless. Never looked back since. The entire storyline and plot truly hooked me, as with the good emotions of the actors during the 10-episodic series. Now I can't wait for season 2 to commence!"
8300,Sweet Home,"I'd recommend it if you have a lot of free time and nothing to watch. The only thing i hate about this show is the music & songs. I think they did a bad
thing when it comes to music & songs , because
i watched many scenes in the show that would be
better without the music. It's like the show's crew
are ordered to put these songs & music by force."
8301,Sweet Home,"The show is very well done. Great monsters, very creative with lots of plots twists, jump scares, blood and mayhem. Good character builds tell individual story lines that keep you guessing who is a monster and who is not. Stick with it and by the third episode you will be hooked."
8302,Sweet Home,"The acting is so good the graphics are amazing
The storyline is perfect, wont let you feel bored, we need another season due unfinished ending .."
8303,Sweet Home,"Show is great, not as the webtoon but still great. Some monsters are really bad makeup artists made, like a nurse with syringes on her nipples, really?! Thank God the main mosters are not like that. The only big con is the song selection, korean trap song and imagine dragons, literally, a stupid song of imagine dragon in the best moments of the series, completely destroys immersion. Probably should have gine the soundtrack selection to someone else."
8304,Sweet Home,"Great story, good acting, scary at times. First half of season one is awesome, second half is so-so."
8305,Sweet Home,"I enjoyed this adaption of the webtoon but, I wish they would have followed the webtoon a bit more. The deaths of Wook and Yuri did not seem right. Though they could be supposed deaths since at the end it showed Wook in the car, but that could have been the evil infected who turned into a gooey like substance who took over his body. The romance between Jae-heon and Ji soo seemed weird to me too, but I do not know if the show followed the same ages as the webtoon. The meaningless deaths of Hyuk and a couple of others just made me upset after reading the webtoon. I am happy that they could continue the show though but, since the webtoon is over and has a completely different direction the creators will have to come up with brand new ideas. Hyun in this show mentioned in other reviews does seem more like a side character to me. While reading the webtoon I could see his growth and his fight with desire. Still overall people who have read the webtoon should watch the show. Even though it is different, the show gives you a new perspective on the series and hiw things could have happened. Though some changes might make you mad, think of it as an adaption and at least hiw the show ends there can be more to the story because the webtoon may never have another part. I have noticed the author of Sweet Home writes stories that are usually straight to the point and short. If you have not read the webtoon I ask you to read it to understand how the story was originally written. I really wish other stories by this author would be turned into a live action."
8306,Sweet Home,"This is one fascinating watch. The show is entirely carried by its strong premise: a band of survivors hunkers down in an apartment complex while the people outside are turning into monsters.There are a couple things to like: the monsters are truly gross and grotesque and the animations are surprisingly good for a TV show. Cinematography and the use of colors can be quite beautiful, and some characters are quite interesting (albeit they are in the minority).Here's what I don't like and why I would not recommend this show: scenes are drawn out with people just staring into nothingness, and the show tries to cheaply evoke emotions in melodramatic ways like overtly and unduly zooming in on distressed people's faces. People often don't react to or even acknowledge the things that are happening around them, which at times results in truly jarring situations that do not make any sense at all. Also, there is a serious problem with editing. Sometimes there is almost no context to what is happening on screen, like a plan carried out that was not discussed beforehand, making the viewer guessing in a frustrating way.At the end of the day, I do enjoy watching Sweet Home, because this show is unlike any other show I've seen before. But you have to be willing to embrace the bizareness of it all."
8307,Sweet Home,"I have no clue what my measly opinion is worth - here it is anyway:The animation and live action blend needed some work, however, I thought after the first few episodes it got MUCH BETTER - I enjoyed the blend even when the effects weren't high quality. I felt it was artistic.The storyline had me hooked. I ended up invested in many of the characters, including the secondary characters - for me that's tough to do. At first I was afraid the show would shy away from certain themes - heavens to betsy was I wrong. They didn't pull the punches or baby us through the drama. This seriously touched me. I'm raving about it.There are several interesting story lines that I hope they unravel in season 2 - fantastic take on monster drama (monsdrama) - and I'm on the edge of my seat for the next season. BRING IT ON."
8308,Sweet Home,Turned out better than I expected. probably among the best netflix of 2020
8309,Sweet Home,"It's just purely AMAZING!!!
truly all-star A-class casts!! Loved how each character really shines and really well depicted. The nuance of emotions is so well done.amazing CG!!!! The monsters are very carefully depicted and I can see how much they invested in this! AMAZING!!!!!I love the story itself, which is prob the best part! It doesn't exactly follow the webtoon, but I love how it keeps the core and tells the story in a more cinematic way. I particularly love the part about how you fight against your desire / us and them.Really look forward to season 2! (Hope there is one!)"
8310,Sweet Home,"Just finished the first episode. A lot of mystery and good horror. Not for people who want everything explained to them straight away. Or those who cant focus on more than one characters story at once.Everyone else, this is plain good K-Horror. Awesome"
8311,Sweet Home,"Netflix What did you do? Stop funding trash. I'd read the summary, thought this should be cool and dived into ep1~7. The acting is average at best,Among them, puppy's acting the best. and Weird confusing storyline. boring conversations. Monsters aren't as threatening as I thought. Overall, it was worst than I expected.
Don't waste your time watching this. This drama is like a teenage."
8312,Sweet Home,"Watched this series because it seems promising after episode 1. However, after binged 5 episodes I was like ""wtf did I watch?""There are too many scenes that has no impact to the whole story, unnecessary scene or plot like the one with the mobster and the child abuser. But, the most annoying part that got me tired and almost give up is that too many jumping scenes, stupid scenes and weird camera angles or such that sometimes left me confused and did not understand what was going on anymore.I stopped, give a shot to the webtoon version, and im glad I did because it is 100% better than this series. In the series, there is no explanation why they turned into monsters, why Hyun able to resist his desire, why Mr. An and Ji Su who had nosebleed seems to be fine and were not quarantined?, there is almost no monster rather than hulk outside the building making me wonder ""why didnt they just go?"", security guard, runner and spider guy were too weak, literally weird character development, weak bad guys, and literally different ending. Oh, and I hate how they make wook this way (he was a detective in webtoon)Maybe I am asking too much, maybe I was expecting too much for it to be like the webtoon (well, since the scripts on the first 5 episodes were the same as in the webtoon), but why so many flaws? I do not mind if netflix adapted it in its on way, but at least keep using the original webtoon as reference.So many potentials wasted."
8313,Sweet Home,"I really don't understand this story so I can't enjoy it. the premise is unattractive and devoid of traction. many things that are not lacking, such as the way the random scene editing makes me uncomfortable watching. and also sudden stories like this and that. oh what a boring show. sorry."
8314,Sweet Home,"Its plagued by a bad script with undeveloped characters and a ridiculous plot.Camera works and colour palettes are off, so does the music. oh the music are way off.there's a potential but wasted. I hope you not waste your time watching this series."
8315,Sweet Home,This show is absolutely amazing. The plot alone is very interested. If you're not a huge fan in the beginning trust me it will grow on you. The actors and character's are all great of course some characters aren't my favorites lol. But anyways please check it out and give it a good rating.
8316,Sweet Home,"Nice Web Drama,I love Sweet Home Team.
Waiting for the Season 2"
8317,Sweet Home,The show I must admit does start slow but you will slowly see all these story elements come together in an amazingly creative way. You will grow attached to a lot of these characters due to the show's commitment to explaining their characters throughly. The actual monsters themselves are extremely creative and I'm surprised how many there are in these 10 episodes. The only downfall of this show has to be the GCI of some of the monsters. Others are extremely well made due to the show's commitment to makeup but others just have a look that can break immersion. Overall please don't sleep on this show and hopefully season 2 is on its way! A true revolution in horror TV!
8318,Sweet Home,"Perfectly portraits the today's society.Very interesting. I'm watching it again for sure.
Might not be for everyone.
The story line isn't in chronological order so you have to think for yourself I really like that but not everyone thinks the same"
8319,Sweet Home,"Non stop action, monsters, drama, and gore! This is a wonderful example of Korean creativeness and how far TV shows have come. I am starting to become a fan of Korean acting, especially in Sweet Home, where everyone has a story that slowly unfolds with each episode and nobody are who they seem. The makeup is great with realistic scenes and the monsters CGI are a blend of new animation and classic effects. The latter episodes include a few more emotions and tears but the entertainment is still there -- you can't have all action and no back story for the entire season. All in all I really enjoyed it."
8320,Sweet Home,"You may want to watch this because you read the manhwa and liked it or thinking that this is original, DON'T DO IT I can't call it an adaptation or original, it's so different and so similar that the best I can do it's call it a rip-off, they cut out so many really important things and replace them with comedy scenes or not replace it at all, same with characters, they replaced some important characters with secondary characters that you don't even care when some of them die, they didn't include any character development, unlike the original manhwa where almost everyone had that moment, the worst thing here is the ending, the ending in the original manhwa was pretty sad and definitely a tear jerker, but here is just a really really cheese cliffhanger, and I have no idea why they did that, cause the story was supposed to end, and from what I saw in this, they can't make something good original to save their life, the next thing is the actors, these are the worst actors I have ever seen, and I can look past bad acting, but this one was just so painfully bad, if you liked this I really really recommend reading the original manhwa, it's completely free on Webtoon so I don't see why you wouldn't."
8321,Sweet Home,"I don't write reviews but this one is under rated. This show is different , no silent promotions. Lot of unique characters showing different shades. In start, you think this is zombie show, but wait for it. It is not bang-bang , zombie killing bloody show. This one has good and meaningful pauses. Showing how different characters behave under panic and attack. It was impressive show with good special effect and mystery. Eagerly waiting for SEASON -2. Acting wise Lee Jin-Wook playing gangster is memorable .Don't miss this one."
8322,Sweet Home,Me and my husband binged this show. It had me from the very beginning. I loved it and so will you! Looks like there will be a sequal!
8323,Sweet Home,"This is easily the best zombie show ever made . It made walking dead look like children in terms of production , visuals and just overall freshness . I got so sick of the same zombie tropes that kept getting made over and over again . This is the first time in years that I actually enjoyed watching a show with zombies especially the lead who adds so much depth with his newfound ...(watch it yourself to see ) Try it ! You won't regret it. Besides kingdom no other zombie show compares until the last of us gets released which I also have high hopes for ."
8324,Sweet Home,I gave it a couple of episodes and now i'm stuck! Not the greatest CGI i've seen but an interesting story.
8325,Sweet Home,"Having discovered Sweet Home on WEBTOON, I found this live action adaptation very lacking. Where the WEBTOON version felt chilling, dark, and authentic, this adaptation feels corny, over-stylized, and lacking depth. If you're a fan of the comic, you might very well enjoy this, but I doubt it will be for the same reasons. When I heard that Sweet Home was getting a live action adaptation, I wondered whether or not it would be among the ~1% of live action adaptations that are actually worth watching. I have my answer now."
8326,Sweet Home,"First off, the translation isn't too clean. There are parts where the conversations just don't make much sense so whoever was in charge of the subtitles made things a little tougher for the viewers. Decent acting but there're times it makes no sense why a character would do what they do, just random events. And the directing is confusing. At least 6 times I found myself asking myself ""wait how did we get here?"""" Did I accidentally skip 10min"". If I didn't read the comic (which is miles better) I wouldn't have understood the story at all."
8327,Sweet Home,"This has been an absolutely awesome find. it's amazing how they managed to make us hate & fall in love with few characters, all that in just 10 episodes. Can't wait to see what's next for Cha Hyun-Su."
8328,Sweet Home,"The first episode is a masterpiece and I was positively impressed by the camera angles they used to film the series, they made everything more intriguing. The character introductions, their interactions with one another seem somewhat out of this world but realistic nevertheless.Reading the reviews I see both the ones praising it and the ones trashing it have 50-70% helpfulness and to be honest it's well deserved: what I disliked was the show turning more ""basic"" as it went one and monsters becoming less and less common. It still managed to stay a solid good show until the end but the drop in quality is noticeable especially between the 1st and the rest of the episodes. They need to learn from The Walking Dead and not repeat their mistakes.The CGI is painfully obvious and some of the scenes may disturb the immersion, they really need to bump up the budget for the 2nd season. I also think that Warriors by Imagine Dragons shouldn't have been in this series, it didn't truly fit any scenes in which it was used and made me cringe a little, an original soundtrack would've been much better.I'm torn between giving a 7 or an 8 but since I feel like I have withdrawal symptoms and it has me longing for a second season I'll give it an 8."
8329,Sweet Home,"I've read the webtoon this was based on, and it was amazing. However, they've changed certain elements of the original story. Some of the characters are different - either different gender, different personality, different back story, different relationships, new characters and missing characters, to name a few.The show also deviates from the original story line despite the crux of it being the same. Now, this is an issue because some of the crucial parts of the original webtoon which makes us, as viewers, understand each character's motives and choices are non-existent in the show. The little backstory that they give us just feels like filler content without actual consequence. My opinion of the show when compared to the original webtoon, is that it is disappointing.However, let's judge this as a show of its own:The visuals look great but also terrible. The art feels like they have a good VFX team behind it, but the direction of the scenes with heavy use of the CGI just feels so low-budget. It kills the pseudo realism that the show could have portrayed.The soundtrack is fine, but the songs that they play during some of the action sequences feel so out of place. It does not fit the vibe of the show or the premise that has been set. The music feels like an attempt at overcompensating for the show's inadequacies elsewhere.The script is all over the place with terrible pacing, and if you have not read the webtoon before, you're left confused and hanging at certain times. It's not coherent. The characters are unexpectedly helpless in a situation where they could actually do something, and are sometimes the opposite. Without spoiling much, you'll find yourself at times pulling at your hair wondering why these characters made such absurd choices. Some choices just make no sense other than, it was the ""edgier"" choice. You don't even root for or think of the primary protagonist as the protagonist of the show.The only good thing this show has going for it is how well the acting is. I can't say much else about this. The show just feels like it had a lot of potential but fell below that quite hard.As a standalone show, I would give it a 6, but as a show based on the original webtoon, it's probably a 3 or a 4 for me.In conclusion, due to the show's terrible pacing and storytelling, it feels like a tribute or a homage to the original webtoon. However, as a fan, I am terribly disappointed in how they've butchered something so amazing.
TL;DR Incoherent plot, terrible pacing, poor direction of the visuals."
8330,Sweet Home,"Stopped watching for a moment after two episodes just to write this quick review. A fast paced, well scripted and wildly entertaining series with a wacky plot line. I hope it will feel just as funky and complete when I finish this binge."
8331,Sweet Home,"Just watched the first 3 episodes.Just go see it without reading and knowing anything. If you love freaky horror, you'll love this one!"
8332,Sweet Home,"Sweet Home has a cool premise. The apocalypse happens and our cast are waiting it out with possibility of monsters wrecking them or them turning into monsters. What makes the show not work for me are the performances of the actors and theses monsters themselves. Honestly, you don't feel too much for this cast, 3 of the actors look like they either in a constant state or confusion or worry even when nothing is happening. There are a few sad moments but they're easily forgotten when a monster that looks like it belongs in a haunted house shows up and gets in a 1-1 with imagine dragons playing the background. Also can we talk about that?? IMAGINE DRAGONS. LIKE 4 TIMES, it was surprising choice the first time but became a joke as it diluted the intensity of serious moments.Overall: The show isn't bad, just not the most enthralling. The characters aren't the most engaging other than the gangster and he says maybe a sentence an episode. I'd say watch the first few episodes and make a choice, hopefully the story gets more interesting if there's a season 2."
8333,Sweet Home,"I suppose that if you haven't read the comic or the webtoon you're will be quite lost watching this. Unfortunately this series is plagued by a bad script, empty annoying characters and ridiculous plot. The worst thing has to be the horrible music. Is this an action or a horror? Had hoped for the latter but the music destroys any atmosphere. Save your time."
8334,Sweet Home,Great acting. Good music. Good concept. Great special effects. Good characters. Good plot. Bad script.
8335,Sweet Home,"The beginning of the show had me pretty hooked, but once I got towards the the last few episodes the dialogue, the characters, everything really just fell off for me. I almost just wanted it to end."
8336,Sweet Home,I would suggest you to watch all the episodes.. Worth Watching...
8337,Sweet Home,League of legends music in a supposedly scary scene. ruined
8338,Sweet Home,"Me and my partner had been watching another excellent Korean Series Kingdom which also hangs in the balance of being renewed by Netflix and transitioning to this was a bit jarring at first. The characters were cartoony, the music at times (certainly in the first few episodes) seemed a little ill judged. As the season progresses however and certainly after epsiode 3 we started to become hooked and by the end we had a very much fully fledged set of dynamic characters. The slightly naff K-pop (Sorry if you're a fan) had started to be toned down (by episode 3) and the ending to the series felt like you'd be taken on a real emotional ride with the comic book, almost Scott Pilgrim esque feel, had been completely eradicated. Funny, clever and some solid acting, I urge you to stick with it and you will be rewarded. Let's hope Netflix do the sensible thing and bring it back for more."
8339,Sweet Home,"First of all i'm one of those people who read the webtoon before seeing this .. For me it's like Death Note all over again .. Cheap CGI, characters act stupid and all rude, pacing is all over the place, acting is subpar and music choice is god awful especially playing Warriors by Imagine Dragon in a fight scene that does not fit .. They've added and strayed far from the source material and make it look like a kid directed this series .. It is watchable but through out 10 episodes i just forced myself to finish it even if its so boring !!"
8340,Sweet Home,"I haven't knew anything about the webtoon (still don't), i just saw the Netflix trailer and thought i'd give it a go, since a like horror and korean movies.
The first 3 episodes were great for my taste (good atmosphere, setting and the monsters were awesome, especially their variety and quirks), the last 3 were great and the middle 4 episodes or so war a bit too slow, with nothing much happening in terms of action, which was a bit of a let down considering the first episodes set the expectations for me.
Overall, really worth a watch, although i would've liked for the middle episodes keep up the tone of the first ones."
8341,Sweet Home,"There are multiple scenes where anyone with a brain would realize that something is wrong, but they react so mind numbingly slow. Even when something obviously dangerous is right in front of them, there freeze for an unnaturally long time. I mean, sure, I know that some people freeze in dangerous situations, but they push it way beyond how normal people react. It is super annoying, and destroyed the whole immersion for me. I don't care if it is intentional or bad acting. I simply couldn't enjoy the show after realizing this, and stopped watching."
8342,Sweet Home,"Just finished all 10 episodes!
Honestly It wasn't like Hollywood movies but it was really great and I really enjoyed it. The way all the emotions were shown was beautiful.
God! It's true! Humans are scariest!!!"
8343,Sweet Home,"I read the Webtoon, and it was so tense and good, but the series isn't as good as the Webtoon. So disappointed 🙁"
8344,Sweet Home,Adam's family movie is more terrifying than this miserable movieWhat is this south korea🙄🙄🙄
8345,Sweet Home,Thriller but with heartwarming aspects as well as humor. Can't wait for season 2!
8346,Sweet Home,"0.1/10!!
They tried, but totally failed.
The worst in 2020."
8347,Sweet Home,"I've read the webtoon as well, and though there were aspects within the TV show differing from the original webtoon, I don't really understand people who are hating on this show, saying that it's too different. I found that the TV show had it's own merits."
8348,Sweet Home,"So I hadnt read the webtoon so I had no idea was it was going to be like. I don't like non-english speaking shows either (I hate reading subs but then the mouth being out of timing and movement with the english dub is annoying) but honestly.. the first episode was weird and a lil terrifying at first but because it was a lil weird it made me want to watch the next episode.. few hours later I've completed the show and now I'm reading the webtoon.
I had so many favourite characters (esp Pyeon Sang-wook <3) but it's like TWD where you cant get too interested with a character because anything could happen. Although I hate when that happen, i also loved the storyline because you don't know whether your fav character is about to die or not. The ending was good too but it 100% made a lot of viewers shed a tear.
Hope for a season 2!"
8349,Sweet Home,The only two bad thing in this show is bad cgi and that warriors lol theme popping every badass scene happened every other thing is good and i really cant wait for season 2
8350,Sweet Home,"Having read sweet home webtoon I was very excited to see it have its own drama. But the show has been utterly disappointing. The amount of liberties taken with the plot isn't even funny. Besides first episode you can be totally certain this is something else. marketed as a hit webtoon but what you get is something else. Webtoon had a good plot progression and pacing, everything was explained nicely and you get to see very good amount of psychological struggle with inner monsters of mc which is totally missing in this series. This show feels more about feminism than anything else. Get a bunch of good looking girls and do plenty of action with them is what this show focused on. Important scenes to plot progression were totally ripped. Especially firefighter girl got more screen time and character development than mc! For god's sake! You're freaking ignoring mc just for sake of your ata girl marketing! I'm sorely disappointed in this show. Please do yourself a favor and read webtoon instead, it is really beautiful story. Oh! Forgot to mention, this series end on completely different note than webtoon so there might actually be a possibility of new season, but with their work in this I'm not watching next one. Webtoon does well to tie all loose ends and end the series on a good note. Also I'm mentioning this again, but firefighter girl totally ruined pacing of storyline. Her introduction to plot is forceful and meaningless to plot itself."
8351,Sweet Home,"Very different, entertaining, more than just your typical zombie/survival show. Deeper meaning and great story behind it. Really enjoyed watching it and looking forward to the second season. Well done!"
8352,Sweet Home,What's wrong with those weak people who are looking at the brave one to die!!! Just for show their scare faces???
8353,Sweet Home,Amazing series zombies and monsters i love them and I think it's great for people.
8354,Sweet Home,I didn't read the manhwa and I've only checked it after watching all 10 eps. I prefer this series as they the main actors were good in their acting. The hook in wanting to know what happens next is also good. I recommend it
8355,Sweet Home,"Not for kids, but a great show! Original and great fun to watch!"
8356,Sweet Home,This delight gets really good after the standard setting up the character episodes. Really getting into Korean TV series and you will be mad to miss this. Great biohorror with a couple of surprises thrown in. Highly enjoyable
8357,Sweet Home,This series is so woahhh... I'm so speechless again and again
8358,Sweet Home,"This is the serial killer Netflix that US series has hit on. Brilliant and fresh ideas !, Very amazing cast! I think this is a refresher on the series that's all. Very worth watching !!."
8359,Sweet Home,I think it is well made. Acter did act very well. Monsters are also fine.
8360,Sweet Home,"I have read the comic, I have read the webtoon .. and I have seen the drama ... it's really great, I love how they have done everything, although there are always differences with the original comics, but ultimately it is a great version, all the actors , the scenes, the atmosphere, the music ... everything, a 10!It is entertaining from the beginning to the end, it leaves you wanting much more, I look forward to the second part!The best of Netflix this year !! I need more Asian live actions like this"
8361,Sweet Home,"It was really bad, disappointing. I don't understand the hype"
8362,Sweet Home,"If you were looking foward to this and have read the webtoon I have to break it to you that its bad. The cgi is terrible the monsters are more comedic than scary the visuals are just bad in general, this concept and story was not meant for live action at all they should of just done a animation instead of live action the story is ok definitely not exactly the same as the webtoon of course. Netflix just needs to stop making live action series and films of good comics or animes it just does not work havent they learned this already I guess apparently not Just dont watch it not worth anyones time just read the webtoon or watch something else"
8363,Sweet Home,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved the entire 10 eps, it was captivating. The first ep gave ma chill down my spine. The last ep was just too much for my heart. Specially when Hyun-su changes for real. I was like, Yes B***h that's how you do it. That was the best. I can't believe I cried too in a thriller-horror genre. But no regrets. The plot was well made and the acting was on point by each and ever character. Was happy to see a different side of Do Hyun. Song Kang, how the hell did you look handsome even after changing into monster is beyond me."
8364,Sweet Home,"Monsters everywhere, Definitely watch.
Characters are insane."
8365,Sweet Home,"Very entertaining, now I start reading the webtoon manga itself :)"
8366,Sweet Home,I seldom give reviews. But this one is worth watching if you enjoy watching zombie movies. Quite a lot of tense moments. Very entertaining and well scripted. I am looking forward to the next season.
8367,Sweet Home,Just finished all the ep. I spent two nights for this and really love it. I like all the way they created the monsters and the cast especially the high school boy Hyun Soo.
8368,Sweet Home,"It is amazing.. This is the best zombie-monster drama or movie I've ever seen. Everything is so good including actors, the CGs, music and etc. I can give more than 10 rating if I can. I can't wait for the season 2 and hopefully I can watch them soon."
8369,Sweet Home,"-bad cgi and animation
-some characters not like the original counterparts and they changed it so it's not likeable as original
-pacing suxgood stuff
-main character potrayed lthe same way"
8370,Sweet Home,"Watched this in one day with my mom. We had a great time dissecting the character's decisions and circumstances and both really loved the plot, f/x, and characters!"
8371,Sweet Home,"I heard that this is one of the biggest Netflix blockbuster this year with $2.4M each episode so i thought it's gonna be some big thing, but turn out a mess.
Bad CGI, bad acting, bad soundtrack, the monsters look cheap and fake, it would make you laugh more than scare, and there is no depth in the content. It would be ok if this was just a random trash movie,... I am not expecting to see this from a big hyped project."
8372,Sweet Home,It was so freaking good.badly waiting for season 2 .
8373,Sweet Home,"I read the webcomic as it came out, and have loved it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a Netflix adaptation, I was skeptical, but excited to see what they decide to do with it. If you're like me, you'll know that they changed a lot of things, drastically. The first complaint I have is how little we get to see Hyun. I feel like the comic focused on him a whole lot more, and we also got to see his 'monster' way more frequently. The adaptation should've more on him than the rest of the group. On the other hand, I can see that if they focus on the group more, then it would strengthen the fact that Hyun is a loner, but I don't exactly like that. The ending drastically changed, and I think it's a hit or miss for most people. They added in the military and so many more things, but I liked the simplicity of the comic. Also, the girl with the character development (the one who fell to her death at the end) isn't here, and it seems like she was replaced with another guy. Old man didn't get crushed by protein monster (that was huge in the comic, I'm surprised they didn't include that) and I think the romance is kinda bad. The woman and her dead child made me cry though, so I liked how they wrote her. Overall, I'm uncertain where they'll take this, but I'll keep my hopes up for now."
8374,Sweet Home,"The story is really confusing and a lot of character just doing non sense. I know, horror movies usually are not logical in there action, but this show brings it to a new level. There are too many characters, which most of them are not really interesting to watch. There is a lot of CGI, but the quality is on b-movie level.
It feels like a string of random scenes.
4/10 because they at least are trying to make something watchable."
8375,Sweet Home,I really wan't sweet home season 2 PLEASE it's an amazing drama it worth watch just WOW the cast is wonderful I CAN'T WAIT I WAN'T S2 RN
8376,Sweet Home,"I loved everything after the first half of the first episode. The serie caught attention since the beginning with an amazing picture, actuations and a nice OST.All of the characters felt humand and had their own development, you get to know each of them and their back story.The only thing I disliked was the CGI but it's something you can give the blind eye because the series is really good. I really hope if there's a second season, they will make better this aspect. I can't wait to see how this story will continue."
8377,Sweet Home,Story and script is boring. And wow!! Too much CGI super zombie with super powers going on. Characters are all boring
8378,Sweet Home,"Absolutely fantastic, brilliant drama series. Looked forward to the release ever since the trailer came about. Binged watched in one day. It was so eye gripping and intense but field with the whole range of emotions. Brilliant actors, main actor did outstanding job also with his role in particular Cha Hyun Soo portrayed by Song Kang also the CGI was not bad, it was okay for what it was. Absolutely recommend this drama, and hope season 2 can be confirmed."
8379,Sweet Home,"This is one of the worst tv series from Netflix.
I was really looking forward to this, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment. Characters are boring and stupid. Bad CGI, Bad Soundtrack..etc. I think this drama likes random games.the script is very disjointed.This drama is like The Rain."
8380,Sweet Home,The show is quite good but sometimes falls flat on its face.I swear to god if I hear Warriors from Imagine Dragons one more time im going to lose it. As a matter of fact I have heard it so often during this show and in totally unfitting circumstanced I'm never going to hear Imagine Dragons again.
8381,Sweet Home,"If you have read the webtoon version of this drama you might say ""THIS REALLY DESERVES A 10/10"". Over the past few months, Ive been binge reading this comic. And YES what you read is what you see in the adaptation. The monsters, plot the characters the flashbacks and emotions... It is really a YES for me. If yall are looking for a Train to busan like drama. Better watch this suspense bloody series 💜"
8382,Sweet Home,"I was lucky enough to stumble upon the Webtoon about 2 weeks before the final chapter, and not to be too harsh on the netflix adaptation but...As enjoyable as it was, the webtoon imo is a much more airtight and engaging story. It seems as if they want to make a second season to wrap up the story but the original did everything and more in around 150 chapters if i remember correctly. But regardless i'm very happy to see something like this get the attention it deserves. Regardless Carnby Kim is a god damn mastermind."
8383,Sweet Home,"I could not stop watching until it was the end of the last episode. So much is not expected, which kept me on the edge of my seat. It's a bit insulting to even compare this to anything in the zombie genre.It exciting, frightening, heart warming, and action packed.Wow! Please, please, please let there be a second season."
8384,Sweet Home,It is a nice drama. I watched in one sitting. Good entainment 10/10
8385,Sweet Home,"The characters I like are aced, the characters I don't like all survive. Is the scriptwriter work for the last of us 2?"
8386,Sweet Home,An amazing survival thriller....want the second season ASAP!!!
8387,Sweet Home,"The idea for this series is not bad at all, however the effects are pretty poorly and I think there is an overusage of the warriors which makes it kind of weird at some moments. It can be nice to watch, but it is definetly not great."
8388,Sweet Home,"In my personal opinion, this series is worth watching, cause it's a wonderful mixture of different feelings, if you look at the cover of the series, you'll not expect that you will feel all these different feelings! The monsters in the series are professionally made!"
8389,Sweet Home,"The show is definitely worth the watch and it is not necessary to read the webtoon but it might answer questions you have about the story.
The CGI is nothing revolutionary but it is good nonetheless.A quality show with complex characters, an enjoyable story and visually pleasing scenes.I am satisfied with this adaptation of the webtoon, they did not stray too far from the source material and most scenes in the show are scenes in the webtoon. Good job with this one!I hope that we'll be seeing a season 2 in the near future and that the quality remains on the same level or at a higher level than what we've seen with this current season."
8390,Sweet Home,There's never a boring scene on this TV series. You really can't turn away even for a sec. I love the soundtrack. Looking forward for a next season.
8391,Sweet Home,Its so great and worth watching some very cool monsters and again its worth every cent i think its better then alice in border land
8392,Sweet Home,It was a decent addition to Netflix. Majority of bad reviews is from webtoon freaks. It also provides a valuable lesson - All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to be grotesque.
8393,Sweet Home,Was expecting more but the movie plot was too cliche and the characters are all dumb in their own way. It's like watching a comic.
8394,Sweet Home,"This show has so many twists and turns it keeps you wanting more, I fell in love with this show!!! I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a show that keeps you wanting more!"
8395,Sweet Home,"I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this show. It's apocalyptic settings, survival, monsters, mystery.... Camera, settings, actors, direction all are on very good level as expected from Korean cinema."
8396,Sweet Home,"I'm sorry, but this isn't good. Utterly disappointed given the praise it gets. There's neither a captivating plot (rather repetitive, but could've been overlooked had this been character-driven), nor any kind of psychological analysis of emotions/feelings (at the point where people show unrealistically little fear when in dangerous situations), nor emphasis over the survival aspect of having the world end (like worrying about resources, social organisation etc.). It's just a bit of everything that amounts to nothing interesting-no need for season 2 as there's no need for season 1."
8397,Sweet Home,"I was a little confused at first, but I stuck with it because of the acting. Everything about this show is amazing, the atmosphere, the character relationships, the pacing, everything, I've never cried so hard over a tv show. I fell in love with every character including the nasty ones. This is better than anything else Netflix has released. Definitely worth a watch. WELL DONE KOREA"
8398,Sweet Home,This series was great! I would give it more stars if the last couple episodes didn't seem so rushed... I'm stating to read the Webtoons it's based on to make sense of it all and the Webtoons is way better hands down!
8399,Sweet Home,"If I could give a negative rating, I would. Bad actors, bad plot and one of the worst CGI works. That sums it all, save your time."
8400,Sweet Home,"Best apocalyptic show I've ever seen, can't wait for season 2!!!!!!
The special effects are pretty good but you'll definitly be staying for the insane atmosphere. Netflix please give us a season 2!"
8401,Sweet Home,Please send this to sweet home director please put 2 season soso please 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏
8402,Sweet Home,"Very good tv show
binge watched in one night
very interesting"
8403,Sweet Home,First of all I loved the monster theme of it and how it's not just like all the other zombie to show and movies. The episodes get really long tho and sometimes I just wanted to fast foreword. The monster are amazing and the characters are great and I really hope season two will come back! I hope there will be more monsters in the future and I hope there will be more characters too!
8404,Sweet Home,"Don't let the bad reviews stop you from watching this excellent series; watch the series and decide for yourself.
I thought it was fantastic!
I'd say it's a cross between, The Mist Stephen King and the Japanese horror The Eye, with a selection of brilliant monsters of differing types, all excellently created and animated.
The dubbing was good with the characters voices well cast too.
Love each character's personalities, with a little humour thrown in for good measure, but not too much as to spoil the horror, gore and fear factor.
I think it's great that Netflix is bringing some excellent Eastern creativity to the West.
I'd say thank you Netflix and well done to the creators."
8405,Sweet Home,"If you are the type of person who don't care much about plot, then feel free to watch it. But if you do, it'll be a constant struggle and it'll actually get worse with each episode. The pacing was also too fast and many things arent explained. Imagine Dragons is one of my fav band but the music placement is sometimes awkward. Overall I'll prolly still finish watching it cuz my partner still enjoys it. But if it were up to me, I'd prolly stop less than midway."
8406,Sweet Home,One of the best things i have ever seen so far. i'm in love with every character in the show like how can it be possible loving all of the characters. it's just.. wow...
8407,Sweet Home,"Critics said that the music doesn't match at all or that the storyline didn't have any development. It's like they only watched two episodes and made up their mind. I thought the music added so much to the experience that it was a whole experience on it's own. And the story had so many layers that it actually touched me even after the show was over. I love the background they give on everyone and the twists and turns of the story. The visuals are insanely good and just how certain scenes were shot left me in awe. This was the first time I watched a dubbed show and gave it a try when before I would stay far from it. But this really changed my whole perspective and now I will give dubbed shows a chance. I can probably say this is my favorite show or at least top 3. Not only for it's visuals but for how it left me thinking about the human struggles of the characters, especially the protagonist. Such a brilliant show. Everyone should watch it. I really hope there's a season two and hope they could match how awesome season one was."
8408,Sweet Home,"This show is amazing keep watching til the end, the cast did an amazing job"
8409,Sweet Home,"*First*
Most of reviews here do not do justice to this show. The story is great, the character development is also compelling and really amazing CGI and visual effects.*Second*
Story is gripping and it's a roller coaster ride. This show will make you go through lots of emotions. This show gives me the anime *Parasyte* vibe.*Third*
Give this show a chance and watch it all the way it's a great one. Not in a single episode it felt like the show was dragging or was adding unnecessary fillers or anything unrelated to the story."
8410,Sweet Home,From the trailer i was unsure if I'd like the plot of the story but let me tell you the serie is phenomenal!!! It captiveted me from start to finish. Never throughout the story did i feel that it was boring and i wanted to skip a part like i usually do. 10/10 recommend you to give it a chance. It feels like the storyline was very well thought through. Might be because it's based on a webtoon.If you generally don't like horror movies you might still like the serie. It isn't that scary. The is a lot of blood though.If you overcome your perhaps existing dislike of movies with subtitles i'm sure you will be pleasantly surprised with how good it is:)
8411,Sweet Home,I can't wait for a second season. I have a lot of unanswered questions and I can't wait to see what's going to happen next!
8412,Sweet Home,"The world-building and the characters are excellent. I love every role that is in the series. They did a great job. The story itself is nice although, I am not a fan of what happened in the last part. You can say that there will be a Season 2 for this. It is a super cliff-hanger, or maybe I am only hoping for a happy ending for this?I love the scene when Hyun Su totally became a monster, and the Uncle character that made their weapons hugged him to calm Hyun Su. I really thought it would be one of the cures for special-infected monsters. Some more confusions and answers are not yet resolved, so Season 2 is an excellent way to wrap it up.I hate that Lee Do Hyun's character died :(((( He's one of the reasons why there are survivors, yet he didn't survive. I hope he'll also appear if ever there's a Season 2.Overall, I loved it despite its flaws. I am looking forward to series like this one."
8413,Sweet Home,"I couldn't feel tension at all. Music didn't fit with some scenes. Disappointing, i put high expectation after reading the comic."
8414,Sweet Home,Everything was fine but not as expected. They show love between the characters I thought there will be at least one kissing scene. But I was wrong.
8415,Sweet Home,I shared it. The plot is so great. I have to particularly commend Song Kang's acting. His inward feelings are wonderful. I just love it.Can't wait for the season 2.
8416,Sweet Home,"Good show with fascinating plot,however the graphic is terrible. The monsters look like they come from an animation which decreases the terror of the movie. Even in some thriller scenes,I don't feel any fright."
8417,Sweet Home,"To say it was painfully bad is an understatement. No plot, no script, no meaningful dialogue, I wish I could get back the time I spent watching this."
8418,Sweet Home,"I rly liked the first 2 episodes, but as the series progressed it got worse and worse.The actors behave and have mimics as if just graduated, or this was their first acting.Then there is this bad story telling...
I hated all that stupid charatcter vs character interaction in Walking Dead, this is even more bs."
8419,Sweet Home,"Is this a joke????? This series was like a failed animation movie with ""actors"" who forgot their role. The so called human monsters were literally just cartoon animation like Garfield or shrek....!Honestly what the hell was that??? This series is just as bad as the MIST series. The ""actrors"" were so baaaaad !!! Oh my God they were supposed to be scared but the scare feeling wasn't just there. ""Actors"" were intentionally stupid and pretending to shake in fear you could tell. Honestly I've never been so disappointed in a Korean series like this. Its so sad to watch. Sorry but that's my opinion I hate it."
8420,Sweet Home,"The first episode, Lee Eun-Yoo's ballet shoes dangling and the angle created from the inside was amazing! They created such beautiful cinematic angles that I couldn't believe it."
8421,Sweet Home,"The series is emotionally a little low, there is only love in 3 characters, but in general, every part is extremely good and fun, there are no empty monsters, new monsters, new features are coming in all sections, you definitely won't regret watching the 2nd season, I recommend a great series :)"
8422,Sweet Home,"It's Good(Webtoon was awesome great) that there are extra characters introduce in the flix version all Good , Actors were good also but I hope you don't change the Relationship of the characters as you See Ji su was the one in Webtoon to bring Hyunsu to human form when struggle with his monster form however in this Series version there was soo less value given to Jisu it looked more like she is just one of the other survivor fighting for the surviving, which highly is not acceptable."
8423,Sweet Home,"It can be good, but they ruin it, too many cuts, so people who never read the webtoon won't understand."
8424,Sweet Home,"Stupid scripts and dumbest directions...
It's just wasting money.
Never watch it!"
8425,Sweet Home,Really enjoyed this series. Loved the concept of humans turning into monsters.
8426,Sweet Home,"Dont care about the Bad ratings, take a view of this Series on your Own, its absolute beyond awesome in my opinion because i like Asian series and Movies a lot 💪🏼 The Bad Raster dont know what they Talking about 😌"
8427,Sweet Home,"Worst TV series ever. Maybe 1st episode is fine, but other episodes are horrible, it's not worth to watch. Story snd shots continuity are hard to understand. And bad CG is distracting alot. We don't have time watch this in our life."
8428,Sweet Home,BEST SHOW EVER IN EVERYTHING 🔥🔥!!!Please let be season two :(!!!!
8429,Sweet Home,Almost the same as the WEBTOON and everything they had to change worked. 10/10 need to watch
8430,Sweet Home,"I watched the first episode at very late night and it was perfect to make me sleepy since I got bored for poor scripts, bad actors and lack of good drama.
I normally like Korean shows from others I watched in Netflix, but this one feel like they gave the control to bunch of adults with zero experience on filming and they had money to waste on something"
8431,Sweet Home,"Alright survival plot but they had to keep it ""true Korean"" and priorities dramatization over sense and continuity. Especially at the last couple of episodes, which made the whole show feels alot cheaper than it actually is. I lost all interest in the action scene because of this. It had me invested enough to not give up, though. I just skipped over the nonsense drama and floated through the dumb action part to get to the ending, mostly so it wouldn't have been a total waste of time. It's definitely acceptable entertainment during lockdown but don't expect any any more than that."
8432,Sweet Home,"Seems like a cool premise, but the special effects are so bad it's laughable. Basically a mix of 90's CGI and 60's stop motion photography. I couldn't get past episode 2."
8433,Sweet Home,"First half of this series was great, towards the end it got worse, slowly less and less monsters, weird plot gaps... even the soundtrack changed direction."
8434,Sweet Home,"This show starts off strong as a horror drama, but devolves into a silly comedy in the later episodes. For example, there are ridiculously inopportune and overused upbeat rock music and pop music playing during what supposedly seems like horror or tragic moments. There are also recycled cliched (Hollywood esque) tropes of a white collar worker playing out his samurai fantasies of swinging a katana and taking on monsters, main characters surviving what would normally be fatal injuries for no reason other than plot armor, people getting rescued at the last minute, and other cliched hero saves the day from monsters tropes. This show had a lot of potential nut seems to waste it in the later episodes."
8435,Sweet Home,"Idk what to say
i had really high expectations , great cast , amazing webtoon ,
if anyone read the webtoon they will get me
i felt like watching that bad movie ""adaptation"" of deathnote. :(
that was so poorly done ,
the graphics/cgi was bad ,
the acting was so lame ,
eventhough it has a great cast all of them in previous performances r gr8 !
tbh i don't recomend this at all
read the webtoon bttr ."
8436,Sweet Home,This movie is perfect nothing to coment is perfect wait for sezon 2.
8437,Sweet Home,"""Gangster"" was my frav character.... could have done so much more with him....but overall worth a watch"
8438,Sweet Home,"I had the series in my to watch list for a while, but I honestly didn't feel like watching something meh. When I saw the most recent reviews and their positive reaction, I decide to give it a chance. Started it with low expectations, but was completely drawn in after the first episode. I couldn't stop watching and watched the entire season in two days. I am still mind blown, hence writing my first review. It was so fun to watch, the story was an original twist on a doomsday scenario and I caught myself getting attached to characters that I usually don't care about. And I love that they didn't feel compelled to keep all the main characters alive. The backstory might be a little hard to swallow if you are not used to watching asian movies/series, however for me it did not take away from the main story too much. There were a few flaws here and there, but it actually gave the series character.
I absolutely hope season 2 will come and I also hope it will be as good."
8439,Sweet Home,"Sweet Home is nothing what I expected it to be. This got me holding on to the edge of my seat from the 1st episode until the last. The only real complaint I have is that it ended! Sure hope that this thriller of a show comes back for many more seasons. I thought Sweet Home was going to be a Zombie thriller but... Way more.
Loved it!"
8440,Sweet Home,"It's not scary so don't expect it to be a horror series it's more of a thriller. I absolutely loved watching it and I can't wait for season 2. People who call this boring especially from just the first episode, Are you even watching the same thing as us fans? Lol the first episode was AMAZING and full of tension. Though things do quite down at the middle of the season but they pick up the pace again near the end, so it's totally worth watching. Question is now, where can find something else that's equally awesome?!!! 😆"
8441,Sweet Home,"Recommended I wanted to see more the series is very good,counting the days for season 2"
8442,Sweet Home,"If you were to take every 90's classic horror game, an 80's B horror movie that is so bad it's good, have it made in Korea, and turn it into a TV show this would be the outcome.Watched the first episode, and it's so bad but can't seem to stop watching it.If someone turned this into a video game I would buy it."
8443,Sweet Home,"Its realy like walking dead, human is the true monster, but overall i like the way the series approach, the character well developed and how our emotion take control, how we subdue our emotion, our desire, and how we as human act when trouble came."
8444,Sweet Home,"A brilliant and we'll written script, with mostly original monsters. You get to feel for the characters throughout, and the way they care for each other and overcome challenges is a treat to watch. Highly recommended!"
8445,Sweet Home,I watched episode 1 and can't even finish the episode 2.. it has a lot of potential but wasted.. poor direction and execution of the story..
8446,Sweet Home,"I watched this whole series in 1 day, less than 24 hours. This is too good and I totally recommend. Do watch. Can't wait for season 2."
8447,Sweet Home,"OK, I am going to start by saying that I'm a huge horror fan so this series really caught my attention. From start to finish it was a Rollercoaster of creepiness, scares, emotions and awesome character development. Never got boring for even a second and the monsters are really cool and deep if you are paying good attention to the story. Most monsters in horror movies don't even make much sense but in this series it does make sense. Because I got pretty tired of horror movies with the classic its just a bunch of meaningless jumpscares and enemies that are just there to fill the plot. No more blubbering. Go watch this series right now and you won't regret it. Excited for season 2 and what is has to offer! (Also I had to give it 9/10, - 1 because of some fight scenes being a little rushed. But still, a series definitely worth watching!)"
8448,Sweet Home,"People who gave 1 point should finish the show. Honestly, at first I did not understand the subject because I haven't read the webtoon. I continued watching and the show really amazed me. It made me think about every single person's unknown inner world. One episode I hated one character and I was like die right now you are so annoying. In the other I cried for that character and prayed for him/her not to die. I loved watching them become a family. Character developments, understanding all of the characters' inner worlds step by step was amazing. In the beginning there was scenes about past and they are confusing I agree but you'll see that they are puzzle pieces and in the end they would complete the puzzle."
8449,Sweet Home,"Huge plot holes. The characters are so boring, insanely dumb and follow absolutely every cliche possible."
8450,Sweet Home,The suspense at the end was great. Should get a second season. The series built the story quickly. This could have been more subtle. It held all the stories together but we're a bit here n there. The actors were great. Could get their feeling from their expressions. Please end the series don't drop it in between.
8451,Sweet Home,"If you've read the Webtoon, you will be disappointed. I was so excited for this adaptation to come out, but I can't believe they took great IP and did this. The original comic is subdued and spooky in how banal it seems until monsters appear. But this show rushes through character introductions and has a really garish lighting scheme and Party City mask monsters. It looks like an 80s B movie, so if you're into that this might be for you but has none of the original horror. Moreover, it's a tonal nightmare with a random Imagine Dragons' song used as a recurring theme. The flashbacks extrapolate too much of Hyun's character arc in the first episodes which ruins a lot of the mystery about his character. If you choose to watch this and haven't read the Webtoon, I would advise you to check it out to see how good this could've been!"
8452,Sweet Home,"Disclaimer: have watched only two episodes. I think ""Sweet Home,"" the apartment building where the story unfolds, is the actual star of the series. The details are amazing."
8453,Sweet Home,"Atmosphere of the series is one of a kind in comparison with many horror series that I have seen before. It's giving the audience entire. At the beginning, the series has really good pace in building the environment. It shows the empathy between humans are significantly important in this world. However the appearance of the monster is reduced, the series introduces new enemies. It throw off the balance of the movie and the dialogue are made unnaturally."
8454,Sweet Home,"I feel bad for the actors. They really did their best. The directing, however, is absolutely horrendous.The pacing is horrible it seems as if they were trying to finish everything in one season, but were running out of time and then towards the end started upping the pace until it's impossible to follow what is going on. There are sudden shifts in pace and scenes seem completely disconnected. Lots of important plot points are completely skipped. It makes a lot of the important parts of the story seem unimportant and skips all of the struggles that helped build characterization.The plot diverges heavily from the original webtoon, as if someone explained the main plot points to them from a moving car and they did their best to reconstruct some context for the show. New characters are introduced which steal roles from existing characters which results in poor characterization and character development for them all. The main character is tossed to the wayside and they barely show his progress. Many new characters are introduced whose only purpose are to drive your blood pressure up and be irritating; Hyun-soo's younger sister is rude and disgusting to everyone, the side characters who live in the apartment do literally nothing but cry, get in the way, cower in a corner when someone strong shows up, and throw a hissy fit when things don't go their way. They contribute literally nothing.Bass girl has her role completely cannibalized and her roles given to the firefighter girl. She ends up being a minor character and spends most of the show being sad about her dead lover, and suddenly having appendicitis and needing surgery which is performed without anesthetics.Later when the prisoners show up, they spend time building up the leader who then immediately gets killed in an unimpressive way. The guy with similar powers to the main character randomly starts killing half the charactersIn the end all of the actual characters of importance are dead, so when they get captured and the firefighter (only iportant character left) turns on them, I felt no remorse.Also, monsters show up and cause issues in maybe 3 or 4 episodes. They aren't nearly as dangerous or scary as in the webtoon, and don't actually do anything. After going into the basement they only find one monster. Once they start fighting, only then do they see that there's actually tons of them, and they start using car beeps from pressing buttons on the keys to distract a monster. But they didn't show them collecting the keys or planning to do this so it seems completely out of place. Not too long after them driving through the basement and crashing, it cuts to another scene upstairs and the next episode they mention the basement is clear and from that point on it's clear, but they never show them killing the monsters. Then, they don't them planning or preparing to make it but they make a armored car pouring tons of resources into it, and drive it out and it immediately gets destroyed by the protein monster. This happens in a cutscene taking like 20 seconds.The series is full of decisions like this that ruin the flow and make it confusing. It doesn't make it fun to watch for someone who hasn't already read the webtoon. And if you have read it, you would be confused why they changed things so much and destroyed any storytelling. That just begs the question. Who is this for?"
8455,Sweet Home,You want to see a good kdrama. This is not for you. Cheap soundtrack and graphics with a very bad cinematography makes this series an utter waste. The sound track feels as if I am hearing a bollywood action movie soundtrack. It was the worst of the worst. Never see this.
8456,Sweet Home,I just wanna say Thank-you. It's just awesome. I want season 2 asap.
8457,Sweet Home,"I laughed to myself a little at the review that said the episodes ""fell off"" a bit after the first few, the reason being that they weren't being dazzled by the mutating beings anymore and had to use cognitive skills and follow a story. On the other hand, if there wasn't a story, then we would have the other half of the crowd whining and moaning that there was no story, just brutes in all fashions fighting non stop, which is great for some story, but, I want to be on the edge of my seat for real things, I want to watch people struggle as they see signs of their own infection. I want to see people turn on each other and likewise fight for one another as they see people they have come to care about become infected. This show was SO much fun, it doesn't follow the same recipe of, destroy the head, destroy the being, one bite turns you etc. That' was SO refreshing, THIS is why I love watching Korean and Chinese dramas, I find more unique stories. Sure, there are tropes to be seen, but it's not always the same over and over and this show is a great example. I am blown away that the ratings aren't higher on this series. How tf does the walking dead have a higher score than this? I like the walking dead, I watched it, but, it's certainly not unique and certainly not better than this."
8458,Sweet Home,This id consider an original so far got all different kind of monsters but yet it still has to do with a virus....i like the fact they took virus zombie to mutating monsters lookin like theyd be coming up from the bottom of hell instead... not really a zombie show id say but i love it
8459,Sweet Home,"I actually read the webtoon after watch the trailer of this series. It's so good that i couldn't stop reading until finish. Therefore, the high expectation to this netflix adaptation. It only took 1 episode to make me sum up that this is very bad. I know cinema and still graphics are different media, but this is just too far. I can imagine that if i haven't read the webtoon, I wouldn't finish the first episode. Bad CGI (the monsters are not scary at all and more like stop motion dolls), very bad acting and directing. And yeah, the background music is very annoying. I did fast forwarding through episode 1-9, and found that they even changed the story into the cheesy one, and again with bad acting."

8894,Vagabond,"Cha Dal Geon has dreams of becoming a movie stuntman but things aren't going well. He has also adopted his young nephew Cha Hoon. Cha Hoon takes part in a trip to Morocco with his Taekwondo class; unfortunately the plane never gets there; somebody has caused it to crash. The authorities quickly determine that it crashed due to a fault with the plane. Dal Geon initially accepts this but when, during a trip for the bereaved families to Morocco, he sees a man who appeared in Cha Hoon's last video message from the plane he is certain that the crash was deliberate. He approaches Go Hae Ri, an agent of the Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) for help and ultimately she teams up with him to uncover the truth. This will put them in frequent danger as powerful business interests and certain people in the government and NIS determined to keep the crime secret.I really enjoyed this series. The central story is solid providing plenty of excuses for impressive action. This action is nicely varied with car chases; shootings and martial arts fights. There is also a good degree of humour which doesn't get in the way of the story or feel forced. Cha Dal Geon and Go Hae Ri are great protagonists with an enjoyable chemistry. The other characters are solid; those identified as villains early of are suitably villainous and many other characters are nicely ambiguous leaving the viewer guessing as to whether they are good or bad. The cast is great; most obviously Lee Seung-gi and Bae Suzy as Go Hae Ri. Production values were high with overseas scenes clearly shot on location which adds an obvious sense of reality. The story does not end with the last episode; hopefully there will be a second season at some point. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of action packed drama and political machinations.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles."
8895,Vagabond,"Much of this show is very exciting and well written. Even though it's a complicated story and there are many bad guys and conspiracies it somehow keeps it clear enough with just the right amount of recaps to make things clear. Lots of movie quality action in Morocco. From rooftop chases to snipers to street ambushes and sieges. And the excitement keeps up all the way for 90% of show. Back in Seoul there is a bit of a slow down with the political and corruption things but it's not boring like some other K dramas when it deals with the misdeeds in high places. Maybe a few less bad guys would have been better - it seems most of the top politicians and the NIS are compromised. The political crisis with impeachment and all seems eerily prescient of what happened in the US.
Le Seung Gi is convincing in his action scenes and quite good in the quieter scenes too. Suzy Bae looks great here - the best she looked in all her different series.What many people feel was lacking about this show is that the ending is incomplete. It seems things were building up to a second season and many things aren't resolved yet. Hopefully there can be a second season or at least a movie to tie things up."
8896,Vagabond,""" Vagabond "" was action packed, but had some parts of it that it wasn't that good.The drama started strongly, with two emotional episodes that shoot the interest high with the whole action and mystery plot. The action continued till the very end, but the mystery was pretty much solved or got uninteresting half way through. So, the rest of the drama was just an extremely thinly spread plot that was left open in the end, probalby suggesting a second season ( ? ? ). The romance, in addition, was just unecessary. The couple had not one moment together and the whole thing looked forced. The performances, however, were pretty good.So, overall, six out of ten."
8897,Vagabond,"This series started well with some good action and a relatively solid plot. The two leads are both attractive and likeable and deliver ok performances.The cracks started appearing after around episode 4 where more and more layers of conspiracy and corruption are ""revealed"".Basically the writers contrive to build in plot twists that are so farfetched and ridiculous to try stretch the story or over more episodes. Oh, and the action scenes get sillier and sillier. An example is when a car with 4 occupants gets ambushed by a dozen heavily armed men with military hardware, 3 still manage to escape largely unharmed. So silly.Not worth your time..."
8898,Vagabond,"A bit of lag in the middle before it takes off. I'm not a fan of explosions and car chases, so if I say I really enjoyed the characters and action, then there must be more. And there is: heart, compassion, and justice with the survivors stepping up as well as the main characters. Recommended for a weekend binge with two fine stars and terrific supporting cast."
8899,Vagabond,"Its good so far but i can see them running out of plot and start stalling with stupid stunts that KD is famous for, enough with the over the top emotions with the men here crying one min and enraged the next.Like always the girls carry the show.okay done with this show they have ran out of story and ideals now all thats left is kidnapings, car wrecks, failed killings, childish anger outbursts and getting shit faced on the famous green bottle, then repeat it all over again"
8900,Vagabond,"When it comes to a series that has all of the twists and turns, the action sequences, and the intrigue like ""24,"" you really can't go wrong with ""Vagabond.""Much like ""24,"" nothing in Vagabond is like it seems. Characters aren't as they appear to be, and those that you figured to be the ""villains,"" you suddenly find everything turned around.A Korean airliner is taken down by terrorists, and the absolute distraught uncle, Cha Dal Geon, is determined to find out why as well as who is behind it. Of course, at first, nobody believes him until small pieces begin to fall into place. Geon is given some credibility as a movie stuntman who also teaches martial arts classes. However, he quickly finds out that martial arts rarely beats out a special forces soldier. I liked that they put some limitations on Geon. However, I was occasionally frustrated by how he took the lead in NIS investigations. That part was lacking in realism. I understand that he has a vested interest, but I doubt that NIS would give him such free reign and latitude. Still, Lee Seung-gi brings a character with a lot of charisma as well as genuine feeling to the role. He was excellent.Go Hae Ri is the ""rookie"" NIS agent stationed in Morocco. I had a harder time with her character. Suzy Bae is a good--but not great--actress. She seemed to find a hard time treading the line between depicting an agent who is inexperienced but trained. There were times when I just didn't find her depiction believable. I was hoping more for a seasoned actress like Doona Bae (Stanger) who brings intelligence and presence to her roles. Half the time Go Hae Ri doesn't seem to know what she's doing. And too often, she took a backseat to Geon, when she is the field agent! If you're stationed in Morocco as a field agent, you can't be that green. I thought the writers could have done a better job here. Bae also needs to broaden her range. Too often, she has an almost blank expression or the same expression in most of her scenes. I also quickly tired of her ""16-year-old"" reactions to the small, intimate moments with Geon.There were a number of character errors in the series. Never implement a character error in order to move the plot. That's a rookie mistake, and it was used several times in this series to the point when you can't help but shake your head at such carelessness.Several times, Go Hae Ri or Geon would return to their homes even when they know that they are targets. Do you really think an NIS agent would make this kind of a mistake?There was an instant when Go Hae Ri is assigned to protect Geon. She's drugged and knocked out. When she comes to, she immediately goes to the bathroom rather than checking to see if Geon is in danger...or even worse, not knowing if the assassin is even still in the building! If she has enough state of mind to easily make her way to the bathroom, I doubt she was disoriented.Another instant is when we have a sniper trying to take out a target. Geon and Hae Ri are protecting him. We already know that the sniper has orders to kill anyone, including Geon and Hae Ri. And yet, a professional assassin decides not to shoot them in order to kill her target?! I don't know many assassins who have such a conscience. It made no sense.I also wondered if male prison guards are allowed to work at female prisons in Korea.In any case, don't let these minor flaws prevent you from watching this adrenalin-boost of a series! There's scarcely a dull moment, and the rest of the cast, especially Kyeong-Yeong Lee (Edward Park) is nothing short of fantastic! I've seen him in several other series, and he's always tremendous!What really got me, however, was the season-ending cliff-hanger! So unlike most of the Korean series I've seen where I now have to wait for Season 2! I absolutely can't wait!"
8901,Vagabond,"Male lead and female lead are both in my favour. Their acting is beyond doubt terrific. Action scene is captivating too.But seems to me the plot has bugs. I do not think a terrorist attack could so easily be mistaken as accident. And between the exciting action scenes there are boring scenes.The drama also makes me think of Iris, an extragravant production by LBH. It is also shot in Europe. In term of such big production the plot seems better and much closely tied.Anyway I still have much hope on the series. Hope it turns out to become a memorable drama."
8902,Vagabond,"Started reverting to K-drama tropes big time. The scheming corporations, aides and politicians would be right at home in a Joseon-era costume show, the beautiful but evil dames with the champagne lifestyle, plucky hardworking heroes who need a break, another bottle of soju and the right partner. But overall a glossy package with the foreign/Morocco touch and martial arts action give it a good score."
8903,Vagabond,I will wait for season 2 and edit this review since there are so many questions left unanswered.
8904,Vagabond,"A stunt man sets out to avenge the death of his nephew, uncovering a massive conspiracy along the way.I won't go I to details as to the plot - you can read all about it in the other 10,000,000 ""reviews"" posted here; instead, I'll give an honest opinion of the series:The first episode felt like a bit of a drag, I kept wondering why bits weren't cut (which certainly would've saved some of the budget), and then recognising someone from mobile phone footage seen a week or so prior seemed like a huge stretch... but once the action kicked in, all was pretty much forgiven.And let's set the record straight: the action is what we'll all watch it for (albeit, the eye-candy of the female lead is a nice bonus).I've seen the entire first series so I can tell you: there are parts that drag, there are points where the story feels just too convoluted, where the tone shifts almost to comedy for no reason, or gets too cute, or where the action lets up too much, or the action seems too ridiculous, but overall, it's a decent series worth your time if you're into this kind of thing.However, the series could've been tighter - one or two episodes easily could've been shaved off for cuts that probably should have been made - and it is very far from perfect, hence the 6 rating.That said, it held my attention until the end (just about) and there are many out there who would overlook all the concerns I've mentioned, simply because TV & cinema is full of so much s**t nowadays! This probably explains all the 10 ratings you'll see here, even though Vagabond is merely an entertaining series one could easily skip."
8905,Vagabond,"This was action-packed and there wasn't a dull moment in any of the episodes. The cast was also incredible, with everyone being top notch performers. It had everything you want in a great show: great writing, characterisation, pacing and plot twists to keep you engaged throughout the entire thing. Also, this is probably an unpopular opinion but I really liked the ending. It came back full circle and even though the male lead and female lead had budding feelings for each other towards the end of the show, they ended up being torn apart by their circumstances. And although it wasn't shown whether the villain was defeated or not at the end, I think that it would've been too drawn out if they had continued the show to completion. I'm happy enough to believe that the villains eventually tasted their own medicine but if there's a season 2 in the future, that would be fun too."
8906,Vagabond,Korean dramas excel at labyrinthine plots offering multiple layers of suspicion and suspense. This quality is deployed to full action-packed effect here. If action is your thing then don't miss this series.There is also an engaging relationship between the two main characters which adds another dimension to the story.The ending clearly sets up a second series and I am very much looking forward to that.
8907,Vagabond,"This movies throws some very human imperfections into the assassin trope. The protagonist is far, far from perfect, but is just appropriately skilled to survive in pursuing justice in this world of assassins and corruption. It did get rather convoluted, and some of the course of events were really a stretch. Alliances kept shifting, and no one was beyond suspicion. Who you thought might be trustworthy was not. The president's total self absorption was almost funny. In the end, if you just accept the weird musical roles for their over-the-topness, it is fun. Well enacted, and good production value. I would peg it at 8.5 stars,"
8908,Vagabond,"This is pretty tense and I have to admit I did shed a few tears, so good acting (but, as a parent I am susceptible to some of the emotional manipulations used). The plot is about greed and corruption, both corporate and political. It seems the major corporations involved will pretty much do anything and every politician can be blackmailed or corrupted. I haven't been this disgusted with politicians and secret agencies since I watched Scandal (2012).I'm only half way through the first season and it is keeping me entertained, so that is much more than most shows. If you can put up with a lot of ""deus ex machina"" then this show is for you!"
8909,Vagabond,"I really wanted to like this series a lot more. It has an interesting premise, a relatable and sympathetic main character, and a relatively good production value.The good: Generally good acting - at least by the Korean actors. For some reason the non-Korean actors seem to have very little acting ability. A good supporting cast, particularly the feisty NIS agent. Occasionally witty and funny dialogues. Believable actions and reactions of people.The bad: Shaky camera work. Please stop with this - unless you really know what you're doing, just don't use it. In this case, the shakiness is sloppy and detracts from the action rather than adds to it. I actually ended up having a headache when watching those scenes.Noteworthy: One of the central characters speaks pretty good Arabic and Spanish, which is keeping in line with their role. Kudos to the series producers for doing this. It might seem like a small detail, but it is a really important one that makes this series believable.Rating: A solid 7 for now with the hope that the series will improve. I enjoy underdog stories, so naturally I'm rooting for this series to get better."
8910,Vagabond,"This is quite impressive. The story, acting, action and direction are comparable to shows like Bourne Identity and Mission Impossible. The passion of Cha Dal Geon (Lee Seung-gi) draws you in. Bae Suzy as Go Hae-ri has perfected the part of an ingenue who turns out to be and know much more than she lets on.My only complaint is that the ending begs for a second season."
8911,Vagabond,"This story begins with a crash: An airplane crash. Cha Gal-geon lost a ward/nephew he was raising to this tragedy. He travels with other mourners to the site of the impact, which is Morocco. As soon as he lands there, he recognizes a man that appeared in a video that his nephew sent him from the plane, prior to the crash. If this man had been on the plane, he should be dead, not walking around Morocco.Go Hae-ri works at the South Korean Embassy in Morocco. She's actually a fledgling intelligence officer. She is with the crew assisting the mourners. She meets Cha Gal-geon and they eventually work together to bring the baddies down.You would think that 16+ hours would be enough, but more and more baddies surface..... Anyway, the show is not complete. Season 2 has not been announced yet, but they are looking into it, and they know the fans want it.This show is exciting and well scripted. It has action, intrigue, displays of the worst and best of humanity, and the unfulfilled promise of some romance.It's difficult to tell a thrilling tale without being a little outlandish. They didn't get so crazy that it got in the way. The plot progresses without too many bumps in the road, yet it is still quite intricate.The action and fight scenes are good. Like most action thrillers, they should have been in ICU or dead several times over, yet they manage to keep going. It's the usual trope for the genre. Why fight it anymore?The only lasting disappointment you are likely to experience from fighting villains and corruption with Vagabond, is that you'll have to wait on season 2. The wait will be a minimum of 15 mos but a maximum of....well, never. I hope they never do /that/ to us!IMHO...
🎬8 🤔6 🎭7 ⚡8 💓5 🦋5.Suggested Age 12& up."
8912,Vagabond,Definitely worth a watch - never wanted it to end. Just wasn't satisfied with the easy killings shown in final episode and hence lost a point from9 to 8 for me.
8913,Vagabond,"ETA: I finished the series a while back, and I was just a little tortured by the way it ended. If you've watched it too, you'll know what I mean. Basically I'm wishing for a season 2, but not with much hope. I still won't change my rating, because I think this is a damn good show.I feel it may be too soon to post this review, since I am still suffering through each week waiting for the next episodes to be released. Still, from the start this series hooked me in, and I'm absolutely impressed by the performances of the cast.In particular I think Lee Seung-gi is doing a phenomenal job of portraying a heartbroken uncle. He kicks ass, as does Bae Suzy as Go Hae-ri. And ooooo those bad guys are BAD.To summarise for now: it's action packed, and there is great chemistry between the two leads. Political intrigue and corruption mean that you're constantly raging against injustice, and cursing the bad dudes who you hope that karma will sort out quick smart. But there's also constant hope that good will prevail.Every episode ends on a cliffhanger, so the sooner we get to see it all, the better!"
8914,Vagabond,"I really loved this series ""Vagabond"" from the very beginning. It was so thrilling. You know with the plane crash 211 people died in the crash 108 Koreans. Then the secrets start to surface about the pilot being seen alive. The nephew sent a video to his uncle a passenger seen in that video seem to be alive. All I can says to you review seekers suspect everyone. The end is complex you have to get into the mind of the man to find the truth. The lady assassin knows all the sides of the story but is not a keeper of secrets.It is a block buster complex story. Watch it very carefully or you will miss something. I've finished watching ""Vagabond"". Loved this drama and was waiting every week for each episode in New Zealand. Outstanding with megastar actors. Then comes the shocking ending you won' t believe it. It will make you so angry. This is what I said""
Is vagabond really finished? No way! They must be one more episode surely it can't end like that. So frustrating. I was thinking to have another rant at the writers bad enough when Arthdal Chronicles ended on a cliffhanger. I tell you it better have a sequel I was so angry when the beginning first episode was actually the end. Oh its not good enough when they do this to us viewers. It is so rage inducing. I would never have watched it if I had known this."
8915,Vagabond,"I have seen my fair share of Korean dramas and while I can't say this one is my favorite, it's definitely in my top 3. The main character is so fierce and relentless. There's twists but they don't drag out forever and leave you feeling bored like most shows. Every episode something new and exciting is happening. Also it has the best special effects I've seen in a K-Drama hands down."
8916,Vagabond,"This series has great action, great drama, a good plot, and some really terrific acting (seriously, some of the actors' performances are really impressive, notably during dramatic moments. This includes some of the minor characters). The story isn't properly resolved and concluded, so I guess there will be another season (there better be..). I would have preferred to have it wrapped up, but that's how it is. It's not really a problem though, as long as they finish it later in another season.I only really have one problem with this series, but it's kind of a big one: it's fine to have several people be corrupt and/or evil, but when 90% of everyone (and I mean that. We are talking about a shitton of different people here) in any notable position of power in the entire series are eventually shown to be like that (although they certainly don't all work on the same side with each other), and even most of the good people below them knowingly commit actions they know are wrong and evil because ""they are just following orders"", no matter how absurd those orders are, well...it just takes all the realism out of things. I was okay with things up until about episode 8 I think, but after that, things are just taken way way too far, and it just goes downhill from there when it comes to this one particular aspect. It just becomes too outlandish and absurd. Which is a shame, 'cause otherwise the series is really good."
8917,Vagabond,"Most of the Korean series that I've watched so far focuses mainly on romance, but this is a different genre. There is plenty of action and much more twists in this series, after a couple of episodes I was hooked to the series and every episode leaves hanging on the edge of your seats. I most certainly hope that there will be a second season of this series because that's how it ends. If I was you I wouldn't miss it... Waiting for the next season!!"
8918,Vagabond,"Hats off to the writers! The story was so good and the cast was superb. They executed everything so nicely and I loved the twists in the story. How everything is solved but still there's a piece of the puzzle missing! If u love thriller action mystery with little bit tint of romance, u should definitely watch this!"
8919,Vagabond,"This is my 3rd korean drama series.Go to Netflix then search for Vagabond and prepare yourself for a roller coaster ride. Korean translated into English subtitles, I still love this show.If action with a bit of heart is what you want, you came to the right place. A series perfect for unwinding & enjoying.It has a lot of heart & awesome action scenes.I got hooked from the 1st until the 15th episode, but 16th episode( climax), just in one episode they wrapped it all without any end. Anyway 8/10 stars for the story & how it goes till 15th episode, the brilliant acting of the cast and the cinematography. The plot is mind-blowing and nerve-racking.The tension, suspense, action, betrayals, lies and deceit and every other thing you could feel it from head to toe. It's a masterpiece."
8920,Vagabond,It isn't a regular type of KDrama it's completely action packed & the content wise also it's Good. Each actor in this series they just nailed it with there acting. Especially my fav BaeSuzy as GoHaeri
8921,Vagabond,"The show is good and it's worth-watching. It's produced in US style. It has a pretty good evolution of event and plenty of plot twists (not all of which on my taste, but anyway).So if you liked Matt Damon's Bourne series, you're likely going to like this one too. :)"
8922,Vagabond,"When I first read the synopsis and seeing the cast list, it sounded very interesting. Sadly, despite the cast and action sequences, Vagabond failed to be a cohesive action packed film.The series began a little slow and choppy, with flashbacks and a scene we will see later on in the series. Despite this, it failed to really captivate my interest fully. As the minutes rolled by, the thin the plot began to reveal itself. By episode 6, the show was just a series of fight sequences bound together with a dragged on storyline. I have to admit, there were scenes that I skipped and it didn't make a difference to the overall plot.Also, my biggest gripe in many k series is the poorly and cringey English dialogue. I'm not talking about accents, as the cast did make an effort in Pronunciation. My gripe is the way the spoken English is delivered, it felt unnatural and awkward like it was Google translated. In this case, it really pulled me out of the show.Overall, Vagabond tried to be Jason Bourne/Die Hard but just failed to really hit the mark. If you're bored and need a mindless show, try it ....otherwise it can be skipped."
8923,Vagabond,"I really enjoy the series.
Twisted story line is really unexpected and it make the show really worthy to watch.The main cast Lee Seung-Gi played really great acting for both action / fight and melodrama plot ( Also amazing how hard his life during filming since most storyline is about action 🙈)Well, looking fwd for session 2"
8924,Vagabond,"If you like the implausible, impossible, over-the-top action scenes with car crashes, gun-battles and martial arts you have it here.Are some scenes unrealistic and absurd?Yes.Are there plot holes?Yes.Is there an overabundance of plot twists?Yes.But, overall in spite of all the things wrong I have found that many Korean series and films do not have what I call (a baseball reference) ""a closer"":
some scenes, characters, or events that satisfactorily ties up loose ends and make the plot viable.Hey...it's entertaining.I find that unlike many American series (ex. ""The Handmaids Tale"") Korean series and films have much more regard for second and third character development. They flesh out the people, give them unique, quirky and a variety of different traits rather than USA series that only really center on the handful of main characters, who tend to be dull as dishwater anyway."
8925,Vagabond,"This show blew me away - literally. I've watched my fair share of political/action dramas and this is definitely one of the best out there.The plot is amazing, the characters are top and the acting was spot on. My adrenaline was on a high whenever I watched this show - in a good way - because there were so many plot twists and so many things happening but it was never over the top.There are two reasons why I haven't given it a 10 though:The show has some minor inconsistencies along the way, for example characters hiding from killers behind a wall while the killers keep shooting at them. The wall has windows in it though and through the windows two of the characters were obviously seen - technically the killers could've knocked them out with a simple shot through the window but they acted like their bodies were completely covered by the wall.But to be honest, these inconsistencies were so minor and didn't really influence my emotions I truly considered still giving this show a 10.But then I got to the final episode - and found out this show has an OPEN ENDING!!!!While some of the truth was uncovered and resolved, there are still many open questions and the show ended in the middle of an action-filled scene. I guess the producers of the show made it that way so a possible second season would be highly anticipated. The thing is, this show was released a year ago and so far I haven't found any official notice that the show would be renewed for a second season. And while some people don't mind open endings, I don't deal well with them.Conclusion: This show is a must!!! But beware of the open-ending and the possibility that there's never going to be a second season (even though I haven't lost hope yet). If you can't deal with open endings, I recommend to watchlist this show a little while in the hopes that its second season is going to be confirmed soon."
8926,Vagabond,"Vagabond is an amazing drama with great script and amazing performances from every single character. The main couple has nice chemistry ,but I would like to see more romantic moments between them. The action on this drama keeps you focused till the last minute. There are also so much plot twists and of course many strong moments. Amazing sceneries and direction too. I really hope and can't wait for a Season 2 !"
8927,Vagabond,"Fantastic action, suspense, spy thriller! Amazing narrative, wonderful writing, exceptional cast and intriguing cinematic action scenes in every episode. Bae Suzy and Lee Seung Gi were absolute brilliant in their performance together (once again): bravo to the outstanding execution of their characters as NIS Agent Go Hae Ri and her sidekick, Cha Dal Geon. Absolutely fabulous action-packed drama! Loved it!"
8928,Vagabond,Im from the UK. Dont speak a word of korean except for watching classics like old boy. I watched this by pure chance and what a delight. It has action and emotions on a similar level to 24 season 1. I like how the first episode is funny and helps build the characters. Great must watch series. Im on episode 5 and hope it maintains the tempo. Thanks netflix.
8929,Vagabond,I really enjoyed this drama it was amazing and so really with what is happening in our world. Thanks to the male lead actor. I can't wait to watch more seasons of it..
8930,Vagabond,"Started very promising. A plane crash initiated by a passenger is a novel idea and is fresh. And his escaping triggering the entire hunt for bad guys was good. But when people decide to get rid of him in later episodes, the entire plot falls through. Why bother taking steps to save him if he can be dispensed with !"
8931,Vagabond,"Excellent action story with a lot of suspense. Great performance from all actors, in all lead and supportive roles! I watched it breathless. Waiting for Season 2! Don't miss it! :)"
8932,Vagabond,"The first few episodes are gripping, but about halfway through it reverts to pantomime performances (though not all actors are guilty), incongruent attempts at romance and humour, and baffling/idiotic character behaviour.Despite this, an enjoyable and bingeable entertainment."
8933,Vagabond,"Lots of good actors, the story is gripping and the pacing is really good too."
8934,Vagabond,"The whole 13 episodes have been great and have a nice mixtures of suspense, action and some light romance too. The ending closes everything out nicely and also gives us something that can lead us to a Season 2. I hope this show does well in terms of views and rating since they really deserve it. Great story and actors. Love this. 10/10!"
8935,Vagabond,"This show keeps you hooked in, I love all the characters, even the pilot (woo-gi) who we are supposed to hate, you can't help but like him and kinda feel bad for him at times. (maybe that's me)There's a mix of action, drama and some romance all in one and each episode makes you want to watch more.I've finished the series a few days ago and what happened with Emorej at the end was so satisfying and gruesome at the same time. It was spicy revenge.TL;DR: The show is great. Watch it."
8936,Vagabond,"I am a fan of good Korean dramas and I especially like Seung-gi Lee. I was surprised at how good he was as an action hero of this genre.This 16 episode series starts as a jet crashes killing (supposedly) all on board. The uncle of one of the young students killed on the plane sees video his nephew, which was sent to the cloud, taken from on the plane. By chance, one passenger on the plane (with a scar on his face) is seen by Cha Dal Geon (Seung-gi Lee) alive after the crash and the action begins.One female agent (Go Hae Ri) of NIS, comes to believe Cha, and little by little other bereaved family members start to believe the plane was deliberately sabotaged.By the end of each episode, you wonder how the good guys are going to get out of the predicament they are in, but in the next episode they do--although there is a lot of collateral damage along the way.You can see that Go Hae Ri and Cha Dal Geon are falling for each other, which is a weakness since it can be used against either of them by the enemy.My big complaint about this series is in how it ended. Each episode ended on a cliffhanger including the last episode. Does this mean there will be a 2nd season? If not, it left me very unsatisfied. I just think if you are going to put more than 16 hours into watching a series, it should have a better ending. For that reason, I would not watch this again as I have watched other favorite series more than once.I am giving it 8 out of 10 stars because I enjoyed most of this series."
8937,Vagabond,"Loved this series. Action packed and wonderfully acted. Multiple car chases so well directed. Korean series keep getting better and better.
I didn't mind at all that the good guys were able to escape several situations where the odds were very low for surviving. I've never seen a movie or series with as many corrupt government officials as this one.
Absolutely fell in love with Suzy Bae.
She's the cutest girl ever."
8938,Vagabond,"The story is really interesting and well written. The acting is also very good. However the end is really disappointing. Number one it's really vague and it makes the viewer curious but offers no answer (so I guess you can make your own judgment). Number two it's really dense. A lot of story happens in a short amount of time (time of the episode).
Overall I recommend it and it's a very good series"
8939,Vagabond,VAGABOND (2019)Intense. Action-packed. Thriller.Brilliant screenplay! I love the twists and turns of this drama. Made my brain cells work. All the actors were amazing!9/10I have a crush on Lee Seung-gi! He's not that guapo but full of sex appeal. Saw a couple of his works and this one is the best for me so far.
8940,Vagabond,"I am hoping that Season 2 comes soon, the story has to be finished. If I can give a score more than 10, I will do. This show is very intense non-stop action suspense mystery thriller with a lot of twists and turn and the story gets deeper and deeper...Though a very serious plot, the writer was able to inject some bits of humor and a cute romance story. The chemistry of the 2 stars is fantastic and I commend all the stars from the top to the bottom for very good acting where you will love the good guys and absolutely hate the bad guys. I have my new darling crush in SUZY BAE, youthful, charming and cute...I consider this my #1 KDrama show together with CLOY....Bravo,to this fantastic and spectacular TV series..."
8941,Vagabond,"A series perfect for unwinding and enjoying, it has alot of heart and some awesome action scenes. It's funny, sad and goes at a million miles an hour with action. Its well worth the time for action buffs. Not alot better out there in any case."
8942,Vagabond,"It's a decent show with a very good idea. It borrows a lot from spy movies in general, but pushes it too much to make it completely unbelievable. I am not talking about plot holes, but simply defying all laws of physics, logic, etc.
Without being overly analytical just to mention the case when the main characters get ambushed in a dead-end street with professional assassins on the rooftops. Bad guys armed with automatic and sniper rifles can't hit a bunch of people in a regular car not even 200m away. The good guys on the other hand, armed only with pistols, manage to hit a whole bunch of baddies on the rooftop. More laughable is how 10+ special forces crew gets outsmarted and killed by a handful of people.
No need to spoil it further. It's still watchable and it's fun, but cartoonish at times.What's extremely annoying and what some other people mentioned was the camerawork. It's so shaky that it makes it almost unwatchable at moments. Another stupid effect they're using is brightness spikes to imitate camera flashes which makes the whole show feels so cheap.Hoping for a good ending without stupid cliffhangers."
8943,Vagabond,I like thriller and action movies very much but this one was a disappointment to me. I enjoyed the actors but there were several scenes in which the acting and the plot was just too unrealistic. I also did not like the ending and I believe it is a bad idea to make a season 2. they should have made everything in one season with 20 episodes. Too much politics involved for my taste.
8944,Vagabond,"I just wonder who made this crap and what his/her credentials are. I know this was a high-budget production, but it seems all of the money was spent on aesthetics of the show and virtually nothing for the substance. The story line could have been interesting and compelling. However, the idiotic details are just too much to handle. How can a sniper accurate shoot a small mirror, but is unable to even graze two people he's trying to kill? Another killer tries to kill an ""unarmed"" target by going into a convenience store and spraying the whole joint with a clumsy semi-automatic rifle. Why not wait for the target out the store with just a pistol? A guy gets shot, they pull the bullet out, and it's in pristine shape.... It goes on and on... A truly childish effort."
8945,Vagabond,"This Kdrama, is by far the best I've seen sofar, it's Action packed throughout, Great acting, great chemistry between cast, especially between the 2 main characters.Twists and Turns throughout, wasn't expecting most of it.However, this is 100% one of those Kdramas, along with a few others that need a Season 2 .. otherwise, the main bad dude gets away with it.10/10."
8946,Vagabond,"I didn't think I would like but it's a great show , it reminds me of old movies, the hero against all the odds!"
8947,Vagabond,"Overall, the cast performed admirably, the scenes and characters had a decent balance of unpredictability, the script was acceptable, the action was well-choreographed, and the visual effects were convincing. Several scenes were confusing and the ending was deflated. It is not perfect, but still a fun watch."
8948,Vagabond,The two main leads and the action we're a seven out of 10 the last two episodes were 1 out of 10 and the whole plot for the show didn't make any sense whatsoever there's no way you can make these connections and then they added so much more to the ending instead of just ending it.
8949,Vagabond,"Finally a real action drama! Lee seung-gi snapping out of romcoms finally portraying a role that suits him best. Theres probably very little he actually cannot do, him mourning after his nephew is absolutely heartbreaking, on the other hand his composure and determination to find the culprits behind his nephew's death is admiring. He has a real talent when it comes to expressing feelings and emotions.
Bae Suzy was a great counterpart to Seung-gi, she is much younger but no doubt also very talented actress. My experience is that the kdrama directors havent always casted female leads with Seung-gi well, his overpowering, overbearing personality is hard to match, but Suzy managed extremely well.
The plot is also very good and believable. Overall i really enjoyed watching the vagabond and i hope to see them both more often in action movies/series as opposed romcoms, and who know, maybe one day in hollywood?! :)"
8950,Vagabond,BUT... once again they leave you wondering what that hell is going on. Is Hai-ri a traitor also? What? Are they going to continue the story? I have watched too many if these shows that are very good and then they just leave you hanging. Getting a little old.
8951,Vagabond,"It's more than an action serise; it's about the human spirit, it's about willing hearts that go to extreme to prove the truth, it's about the corrupts and the filth of the politics, it's about a few that can make a difference...... And it's sooo much more. Has only 16 episodes. You have to watch it!!!!!"
8952,Vagabond,"If you want something thats gonna be gripping, and highly engaging and fast paced this is the drama for you!There are no wasted scenes or drawn out moments in this drama. Solid performance by Suzy and the others and the action is totally rad and well taken.The ending is full circle but I think they might make another season. if not that would be my biggest critique because just as we think Suzy and Lee Seung-gi are about to be together they cut their relationship and Suzy thinks hes dead and moves on. I don't like this ending.
Otherwise you will love this fast paced, exhilarating Drama. Worth watching if your into action shows and such"
8953,Vagabond,"OK only four episodes to this point, but I am hooked. They are released on Netflix, two episodes a week. I won't go into the premise, others will do that. I will just say that the action scenes are taught, slick and well choreographed. This is well worth following. The only criticism I have is that the ""nutcase who doesn't know what he's talking about"" bit, even though the terrorist incident in question should have been obvious to a blind person, is wearing thin. I hope they resolve that one quickly. Otherwise go for it."
8954,Vagabond,"This is one of the best action kdramas ever
The story and the acting are just amazing
I love this drama soooo much
Highly recommended"
8955,Vagabond,The last 10 min of the final episode ended with a cliffhanger. WTF... Otherwise the show is amazing.
8956,Vagabond,"Storyline: The series tells about an event that was perfectly planned and drive the main character to reveal the incident.Maybe this series can relate to the real life missing aircraft nowhere to be found and the writers seems to have the idea on it alter a bit. That's what I'm thinking.Binge on watching: Yes, you want to know it all. One episode lead to another and two episode not enough to satisfy your curiosity."
8957,Vagabond,"Imagine if you watched 24 and cared for the characters. Imagine you genuinely liked them and wanted only their well being. Imagine the characters were capable humans and not ridiculous plot device daughters possibly one of the worst crimes in TV history. Fallable likable humans that you relate to because none of them are superhuman or anything, just normal people in supernormal situations... and then imagine the program repeatedly punches you in the heart for liking them. That's Vagabond. A singilar great piece of tv, the reteaming of Lee Seung-Gi and Suzy Bae is inspired, the chemistry is brilliant. The story is great keeping you on your feet. The action feels like something out of an MI film.
The humour is brilliant placed, typically Korean and therefore aligns with Anglo and therefore actually funny, and again human. Faultless TV. Watch it."
8958,Vagabond,"Well this one is genuinely a proper action packed thriller series. There are tons of action scenes, a very strong script and some very good acting from the cast.The story is interesting and keeps you at edge of your seat. The suspense is also there till the very end of the series.But one thing you should keep in mind before watching is that the ending will keep you hanging and the story will wind up only when the second season comes so if you are planning to watch then make sure the second season is confirmed else it will be waste of time."
8959,Vagabond,"I think I wasted 16 hours watching what will happen next..but the ending is zero with no justice served to the real culprits, no abrupt end, till episode 15 everything will be okay..but just in one episode they wrapped it up all..without any end..actually ,one will never accept how the story ends.. disappointed. Anyway 9 stars are for the story ,how it goes till 15th episode, the brilliant acting of the cast and the cinematography..16th episode is
simply waste of time..."
8960,Vagabond,"One of the reasons the raid: redemption, the raid 2, Ong Bak are amazing action movies is because of the steadiness of the action shots. There nothing worse in an action/martial arts scene than shakey, over edited, multiple camera cinematography. I wanted to like vagabond. It had great potential. The characters were great. So was the acting and story. I couldn't continue after the third episode. The action/fight scenes were unbearably shakey and overedited. I'm not talk about the Borne franchise shakey, I mean the cameraman was having an epileptic fit, whilst sitting on a jackhammer. IT... WAS... TERRIBLE! Who thinks this is a good idea? Who thinks this makes for good action? Stop it! Stop it now. I couldn't believe how bad the camera shaking was. Can't see what's going on in the shot. Do better!"
8961,Vagabond,"A cute couple with sweet chemistry and a plot with twists after twists after twists and then some. It's mostly fast paced and fun but the overall conspiracy at the end of it didn't make any sense... Basically for things to have worked out the way they did, the mastermind would have to have had God like qualities of omnipresence and omniscience. But nonetheless, it was a fun watch and I am not a big fan of mindless action but I did enjoy it.One major complain though, unless there is a season 2, I am unaware of, the conclusion didn't make much sense. The makers should have stuck to the fun, action genre with a sprinkle of cutsie romance and given us catharsis... Closure but no, they decided to force a Shutter Island ending on a Fast and Furious."
8962,Vagabond,"This has to be among the best thrillers out there. Elite show. Edge of your seat type of thriller with a handful of comic moments. Amazing show with beautiful scenery (Morocco & Portugal), savage action scenes, nerve wracking moments, heartwarming moments, and great lessons to be learned. Rewatched it countless times. Got my whole family and friends to watch it, NO KIDDING😂🙌 The story is amazing, the action scenes, cinematography, the visuals, special effects, CGI, acting, chemistry, scenery and soundtrack are all amazing. Fast enough pace with countless plot twists and feels. Also this show teaches you lots of lessons on trust, teamwork, family, hope and faith.
CANT WAIT FOR SEASON II
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
8963,Vagabond,"The show was good.... Then it ended on a cliffhanger! No talks about a 2nd season either & it's been almost 2 years since the show ended. With such an extended amount of time since the ending, I doubt a 2nd season will happen."
8964,Vagabond,"Vagabond joins the league of my favourite Korean action series such as K2, Iris and Two Weeks. Right after the plane crash in episode 1, the suspense and intensity in each episode does not stop. Every episode will keep you at the edge of your seat and that surprisingly made the show fun for me.
The pacing is very fast with lots of twists viewers will not see coming. The storyline is very heart pounding with main characters been chased in from Morocco to Korea and people trying to kill them in almost every episode.
The story ended with major answers to quetions about the plane crash but raised more questions which were not answered. Vagabond never has a dull moment with its storyline and I hope they get to make a second season as the story ended with a cliffhanger."
8965,Vagabond,"Well, this is one of the best kdrama of all time. The twists, the actions and the acting are good. If you are not familiar with kdrama, you should watch this. Some of the episodes may be boring to you. But watch it to the end. You'll gonna love it."
8966,Vagabond,I never thought that this masterpiece of series can hold me.I love the the scenes from morocco tanger and the changes of the scenery'sThe actors are great and I like the story twists so much.You never now the true every time you think this vagabond change the rules.Conclusion:Whe need more 😄🤙🏽
8967,Vagabond,"Nice drama, it keeps the attention high until the end. Unfortunately the last episode ruined everything. Or is it not the end? Will a season 2 ever follows?"
8968,Vagabond,"Korean thrillers are notable for their subtlety, cleverness and clever drama. Their beautifully choreographed battles and shoot outs. Their exceptional cinematography.
This series completely lacks all of these qualities. None of it makes any sense. At many points I wondered if it was trying to be a parody. Do not waste your time. Try K2 or Iris or Man to Man for something worth watching."
8969,Vagabond,I watched two episodes and just found the whole premise childish. Will appeal to a teenage audience.
8970,Vagabond,"The series was just awesome! The actions the stunts the graphics, casting and story well, but there comes time where there is too much drama just hard to bear. Otherwise it would be an 8 * also this is a must watch and one of the best korean series I watched can't wait for another season. And Please don't drag the episodes too much this time 👏🏻"
8971,Vagabond,Amazing amazing amazing! The stunts are of international level!!! Waiting for Season 2!!!
8972,Vagabond,"Great performances. Good chemistry between the actors. Story was great, lots of twists and turns. But, the last episode was a cliffhanger and the story ended with a LOT of open questions. Now, I'm searching for any news of when season 2 will come out with no success. There's no commitment from the producers that there will be another season. If I knew this show would leave me hanging I would have avoided it."
8973,Vagabond,"First thing first... when is SEASON 2 coming :)This is an amazing Korean series, filled with a great thrilling storyline, great actors and overall super direction. It binds you well from the first episode and you will feel like it should never end. Lots and lots of twist and turns during the series follows but what remain exciting is the next scene. Got for it people, even if you are not native Korean (Like I am not).. this is still worth your time to be watched with English Subs."
8974,Vagabond,Without any expectation started to watch this series. Best korean drama with action packed stunts.. Stunt man vs the Korean government superb execution from the team. Both male and female role just rocked their acting. Don't miss this if you love a action packed suspense thriller.
8975,Vagabond,"Good plot. Politics, Espionage, Assassins and a little bit of love story. Nothing to yawn about the love story. The action is okay. Many unbelievable scenes and overseas settings. It could use a Part 2 Second Season."
8976,Vagabond,Minor defect? Yeah. I found a flaw in the ending of this drama where the conflict hangs. But overall is good.
8977,Vagabond,Please continue with this show come out with more episodes. All hail season 2!!!!!!
8978,Vagabond,I love the main actors but the female villains are seriously cringe worthy. Especially their English. It makes the show get downright cheesy at many points. The female assassin was the worst part of the whole show. Terrible acting and i couldn't understand her at ALL when she spoke in English... why did they do that?? It was hard to get past. The action was great they definitely spared no expense but the show felt like it lacked substance after the first few episodes. Wasn't the worst... wasn't the best. If it wasn't Seung Gi i would have given it a 4 tbh.
8979,Vagabond,Lots of reviewers rave about this series. To each his own.I will just say that after 16 episodes you are left with a cliffhanger and a completely unresolved plot and thus far there is no sign of a second season. Don't waste your time with it as you will only feel like you have been cheated. If they ever produce a second season then consider watching it.
8980,Vagabond,He's penniless. Where does he get the money from to cover all those expenses?
8981,Vagabond,"Hands down the first episodes were 10/10 but after a while the action was just ridiculous, but still it was a great series. But the ending... So horrible!!!! I can't express how disappointing the last episode was!"
8982,Vagabond,"Overall it's good. Actors fit their roles, mix of exciting and sentimental moments...but some writing issues are really getting on my nerves, like some other review said, too much things happen for the starting plot to have been an ""accident"" main characters are constantly getting in the cross hairs and don't even tell about it to back up their evidence. Also a hitman claims to have been sent to kill and make it look like suicide"", and his method is to strangle with a string?....yes totally look like suicide...come on!?? more things like this happens that just make you frustrated, especially how they handle evidence and just say parts of all info they have to back it up and not all.
Still it makes me want to see more because of the general storyline and performance of actors"
8983,Vagabond,"The male lead is a stuntman with martial arts background loses his nephew in an airplane crash. the female lead is the rookie agent working for national intelligence service.
This happens in the context of two companies fighting for a 1 trillion dollar bid to sell military aircrafts to the govt. show is about how these two investigates the who and why behind the crash and bring to justice.An interesting part of the show is the guessing game it plays with the viewer who is the bad guy, who is the mastermind. It delves into politics, self-interests, bureaucracy, lobbying.While the hero is an emotional dumbass, heroine that brings common sense, charm and feminine brightness to the show.
Having mixed drama in thriller plot brings lag especially after 5 episodes however, it is worth watching."
8984,Vagabond,"It is enough to say that just the first episode will have you genuinely laughing and crying, this show dies a fantastic job at evoking your emotions as it reflects off the profoundly fleshed out character's. Fantastic work and absolutely recommended!"
8985,Vagabond,"Some users need to be banned from rating movies here, they made me to watch this crap was seeing 10/10 ratings everywhere and I thought this is a perfect movie c'mon!!! I'm really annoyed AF. I really tried kept on watching till EP8 and couldn't take it anymore only the first Episode was great, after that it was just annoying, wack acting, provoking acting and writing. Please those calling this masterpiece and so on how do you rate movies gosh I'm really provoked."
8986,Vagabond,"One of the best action packed Korean series . I Liked Every Character And The Cast Was Awesome
Waiting For Season 2."
8987,Vagabond,Decent storyline with twists and turns. Don't expect anything too serious at some points it descends into slapstick but they must have had a blast making this and I enjoyed it.
8988,Vagabond,"Was enjoying it until the last episode. Might have given it a 9. Last episode was so terrible, I give it a 2. I could give many examples of how much was up in the air. Virtually everything that was built up was not resolved. Almost makes me not want to watch anymore Korean series."
8989,Vagabond,"I saw the opening credits of the first episode and I jumped from my seat from the excitement after seeing the cast!! The series has amazingly good actors. I usually try to not watch a good serie as soon as it's released, because I don't have the patience to only watch 1-2 episodes per week, but this one popped in my Netflix preview and I clicked on it. Now I'm counting the time until when I can see the next episode. It's a great serie that keeps you glued to the screen. Great action, great play and plot. Really looking forward to see how it continues."
8990,Vagabond,"This is my first time reviewing any drama on IMDB. Except the fact that Seung Gi Lee outdid himself and his acting keeps improving with every series, there is nothing special about this drama. It has a cliche story and I don't know why but female Korean actresses can't act at all except a few (like Doona Bae from stranger best series ever). She is like a robot and shows no emotion through out the series. Spoiled the entire Drama for me. Loved the action and 7 rating just for Seung Gi Lee & action."
8991,Vagabond,"Loved the acting ,action,and conspiracy story line watched the whole series loving it but absolutely hated the ending. I mean who wants the characters you loved all the way through the story to end up as a vengeful ruthless killer and a woman who sells herself for illegal arms deals . Sad"
8992,Vagabond,"The actress is cute so i watch the whole series. The actions is pretty good for a TV show. There were a few episodes where there wasnt any actions and u forget that its an actions series.My problems is with the plot. the supposely REAL villain was helping him the whole time. no good explanations for doing anything. its like they just threw in the twist ending at the end saying this is the real bad guy. but everything he did up until the end didnt make any sense.Towards the end, when the main character have flashback to realize who the bad guy was, he was having other characters flashbacks!! how do they have other people flashbacks???"
8993,Vagabond,That's wonderful! This Korean drama is the best I've ever
8994,Vagabond,"This drama is so incredibly well done in terms of production and film quality. The story seems to have a few holes as I believe there should be a second season to the show. The stunts are done mostly by Seung-Gi and they are amazing. Overall great performance by all the cast, definitely kept me captivated and sitting at the edge of my seat the entire time."
8995,Vagabond,"Vagabond is a fast-paced series that at first maybe starts off a bit slow but develops the characters better and better and the action grabs the viewer more.In any case, it is worth it enormously to have Lee Seung-Gi acting and it certainly does not disappoint in that sense, it leaves you wanting to follow a second part and it is to clearly enjoy it."
8996,Vagabond,Is there gonna be season 2?? Please make happen season 2 I want a closure for this series..
8997,Vagabond,"Bored with Netflix and Prime offerings I decided to try out some non-European/American series ... io and behold, I wish I'd tried Asian series before ! Of all those I saw, I think Vagabond is my favourite series. It has everything I like in a series, some good action, betrayal, villains you'd love to punch in the nuts, and romance. Not that there was a lot of it, but the budding romance between the main leads was a joy to watch, especially thanks to Bae Suzy who's simply amazing in all aspects."
8998,Vagabond,"So first of all, it started really good, but the first thing I noticed was the action scenes. They shake all over the place, why? As for me, a person who always looks for the details in action scenes got so disturbed by the shaky editing. I know the scene should be exciting, but you just took that away on all of the scenes because of it.Besides that, everyone fits in their roles quite well, but then again. The script writers should definitely look for more inspiration if the main lead constantly fails in everything that he does, and why does it seem like he lacks intelligence.. Some decisions were cringe worthy to be honest. Kept asking myself: why? Some logical thinking and everything could probably solved the first few episodes, but I guess that's why they stretch the number of episodes with a dumb script for the main lead.But that's my personal opinion into 3 episodes. I might edit this review after watching everything, but by the looks of the consistent shaking scenes, I don't think so."
8999,Vagabond,"A MUST WATCH if you like an action thriller movie with a pinch of humour and romance.
A total awesomeness in 16 out of 16 episodes. Less Seung Gi really did a good job in this drama. Daebakkk!"
9000,Vagabond,"This is maybe the best show I have ever seen. I don't know why I started watching it but MAN! It has so many twists I was getting dizzy!Once it was over, I really felt like my life was missing something. This show is just so well written and acted, it's impossible not to love it!Do yourself a favour and WATCH THIS SHOW!"
9001,Vagabond,"This is by far the best show I've seen in 2019, and I'm dying waiting for season 2 to come out."
9002,Vagabond,I watched the show the story was good too much garbage to lengthen the show they could have done it better and more efficiently like taken away all that non- sense too much talking and being retarded not taking enough precaution total mess.
9003,Vagabond,"I love this action thriller VAGABOND! Even though its a TV series, the plot twists and action scenes are like scenes from a big movie. All actors and actresses are excellent !! I can't wait to see season 2 and hoping they make season since season 1 ended in a big cliffhanger.!! The Best K drama/action I've ever see"
9004,Vagabond,"An amazing show.
It has everything from deep emotional drama through political thriller and good action.
Don't miss it.
You'll be amased."
9005,Vagabond,"I'm from South Africa, this is my 1st time watching a Korean series, I can just say brilliant!!!! Good story, good action, and the actors just love them. Especially the main male actor, definitely my favorite. I hope there will be a second season 🙏🏻"
9006,Vagabond,All in one kdrama. It's a much watch kdrama. Lee seung gi's excellent in all ways. All the cast did very well. I loveeeee it. It's like I'm watching a hollywood movie.😍👏👏👏👏👏
9007,Vagabond,"Season 1 was a full combo of Action, Adventure, Romance, Mystery, etc. But, it ends with a cliff hanger... can't wait for season 2. Plz atleast confirm the sequel."
9008,Vagabond,"A good thriller with a political touch. As, you move towards the end of the season its gets more interesting. After the first episode you will get hooked to it. Nice show to watch."
9009,Vagabond,"This was my first ever K-drama. I never really thought about such a sweet and deadly combo of action and romance. A lot of reviewers left their reviews with 1, 2 or 3 stars. I mean, why ??They think that the main actor made silly and dumb mistakes. But, if you people really want to watch something to be absolutely perfect, then that would be a movie made by programmed robots, not humans. Considering the circumstances , the mistakes were actually made to make think the viewers about the very next movement. And to be very honest, there are plenty hollywood movies out there, have literally no relation with logic though is was way too realistic than those.VagabondEpisode 13
49 : 25 - 53 : 25Episode 16
40 : 39 - 41 : 43These are one of the most charming and heart-melting moments of Vagabond."
9010,Vagabond,You have to watch to realise why its worth. it really am amazing story
9011,Vagabond,"Please make season 2
I have watched it 3 times all the way through.The characters are amazingThe trama is; oh my GodWe need seasons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6"
9012,Vagabond,"I just can't believe this rating, maybe those who rate 10 have been impressed for the production quality of this action drama, but the storyline sucks, the main character act skills suck, a lot of plot holes... if they do a season 2 I definitely won't see it."
9013,Vagabond,Amazing action in my opinion ... drama but like watching a movie ... good job vagabond👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍
9014,Vagabond,"The more you go in the series, the more writers just break all and any logic to justify their situations. So if you are looking for a good and plausible story, this series is not for you.
On the good side, the representation of Morocco, although not as accurate as I was hoping, is better than maybe most American movies/series."
9015,Vagabond,An action movie with a very intense storyline and a twist throughout the series. The sad storyline is what made me really love this series
9016,Vagabond,"I like the series very much, i wish that there should be more episodes so both suzy and seung-gi meet at the ending and expose all those corrupted leaders in the vagabond series."
9017,Vagabond,"I am already submit my review but not satsfied
so here i am writing this again.....eagerly waiting for part 2 series of vagabond☺☺☺☺"
9018,Vagabond,"Adrenaline, plots, twists and turns, a bit of romance (not enough), amazing actors. Impressive Lee Seung Gi."
9019,Vagabond,"I have ever seen better than this
Action drama
Twists ,actions , thrill edge seat
Drama series."
9020,Vagabond,"Omg !!!!!!!! This drama 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!First of all , I NEED A SEASON TWO RIGHT NOW !!!!!!! But im hoping they would bring a season 2 coz why not , its netflix , and the show is awesome , the actors are fabulous , the story is bombarding so why not ?!Starting with the story, it started off pretty simple like a orphan nephew and his uncle living together surviving by fits and starts but they were happy until one day...TRAGEDY! The nephew dies in a plane crash and we're like okay thts really sad they made us weep in the first episode, but when we get to know tht its a conspiracy and the plan crash was nothing but an act pulled off by some powerful crackhead peoples for their own profit, killing thousands of innocent people and giving their family grief for their entire lives !!!! Im like go main lead kill them all !!!!💥
The actors did a wonderful job, everyone ! The protagonists did their very best fighting for justice and the antagonists tried everything they could to stop them ! It was a cat and mouse game but rather with lots of action, guns and bombs! I loved our main lead he was so good !!! *Chefs kiss* and I really have to thank the writers bcz the push behind the main lead to fight all those ppl was very strong , strong enough to drive us ! Anyone who loses his child would do the same thing as cha dal geon. Although he was his nephew he was like his own child to him.I loved our female lead , how can someone be so badass and cute amd beautiful at the same time ! Man !!! I loved whenever suzy spoke spanish!!! I really loved the chemistry between our leads !!! There were not so many scenes but still I want more of them!Rest I loved all the NIS agents !!! Especially our chicken shop 😂 and our mr.hacker guy!This drama has humor , amazing story line ,plot twists, romance, emotions , and lots of thriller and action!!!! Not to mention the wonderful osts ! And amazing cinematography!!!!While u watch this show I just wanna advice to guys to not trust anybody ! And when I say ANYBODY I mean it !!! I would highly , highly very highly recommend you to watch this masterpiece! Go and watch it now !!!!!! And yeah if u dont have a netflix subscription u can watch it here : dramacool.ai thank me later😉"
9021,Vagabond,"I am waiting for the session 2
Because this series 😘😘😘😘🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
9022,Vagabond,That made me cringe hard several times. Why would the writers feel the need to make such over-the-top western characters? I see this in Chinese movies where foreigners are implanted into the medium just to make the Chinese viewer feel good about how bad those characters are. I guess this is a Korean example.
9023,Vagabond,"Does South Korea have no other better movie stars to play Dal Geon? I could have given this series 9 if the main character is played by someone who is more macho.Dal Geon is so vengeful and always act like he is the only person who suffers in this world. The person who always put his personal ""great mission"" above all."
9024,Vagabond,Best action thriller and romance drama in the world there gotta be a season 2
9025,Vagabond,"Waiting for s2,, best kdrama ever made,,the acting the production and the plot twist and the action scene were just perfect. Only critic is im sad we had to wait for s2"
9026,Vagabond,"This review was done by the 14th episode, the drama hasn't completed yet, but it went better than expected.I loved the storyline, the acting, the right amount of emotions portrayed by the beautiful actors. It's just the right amount of action, thrill, combined with intelligence and good luck, you expect to find in an action-thriller tv show. Seung-gi Lee really knows how to deliver his tough and soft scenes and Suzy has portrayed her role well as well. Kudos to direction and production team as well and of course the writers who channelled such an interesting story.A must watch show."
9027,Vagabond,"When I first started this drama I wasn't sure to expect, except for hoping for a lot of action, and the first scene certainly set the tone for the rest of the drama!
Afterwards I was really hooked, and each episode made me super curious about what was going to happen next!
The acting and cinematography were great as well, and I liked the soundtrack as well, especially the credits one!Definitely a good watch if you're into good acting, suspense, action, politics!"
9028,Vagabond,"Like many korean drama series, too weak screenplay and unrealistic. Not bad for acting of both male and female lead actors, and some good action shots, but not for the rest.Do not waste your time."
9029,Vagabond,Loved it very much. Amazing show. Can't wait for season 2.
9030,Vagabond,This series It was beyond my expectations; it was so tense and made you curious when watching it; I didn't even realize about a time when viewing it. Highly recommended if you like actions thriller series with many plot twists 👏🏻
9031,Vagabond,"Everything was Next level, awesome, crazy, no words to Describe"
9032,Vagabond,At one time you are grabbing your seat and the next you know you are crying holding your head in your hands. Every act is perfectly proportioned.
9033,Vagabond,"It's one of the best ever korean thriller seen by me till date!! This thriller is filled with enough suprises and twist that will compel you to love every bit of it. Superb acting skills by lee -sung gi ,bae suzy and entire acting crew."
9034,Vagabond,"Although Vagabond had numerous plot holes large enough to drive a truck through, the action was great and I enjoyed the romance angle. In fact I've become a real fan of Bae Suzy thanks to this drama. However the last episode ruined the entire series for me. It seemed like they ran out of time or money and shot scenes that jumped around without bothering to explain how the characters got to this point. What was more troubling is that both of the lead charaters took 90 degree turns. After carefully showing how Cha Dal Geon and Go Hae Ri evolved through the first 15 episodes, the last episodes portrayed them as almost totally different people, doing things that seemed totally ""out of character"" for them without any explanation for why or how they changed. I was also very disappointed by the lack of emotional payoff - I came away feeling empty."
9035,Vagabond,The ending is just too disappointing after the anxiety build up between the episodes the ending doesn't measure up to the whole series.
9036,Vagabond,"I totally respect all Korean things
full of details a really new story and creative"
9037,Vagabond,"I love this series. It's very unfortunate that there are only 2 episodes coming out weekly.I came to see the reviews and was shocked to see 2 negative reviewsWhat I love about the series is that in just the first episode alone, there is so much happening already. And it does hit on an emotional level. I almost cried after the first episodeUsually series will make the first few episodes boring as they want to spread out the exciting part in the later episodes. But Vagabond definitely took another turn and I really love that they just make every episode as exciting. Other series can definitely learn from this.Fortunately we have many more episodes to go"
9038,Vagabond,"The plot is pretty entertaining and it moves quickly from the get go. I really want to like it but my god the camerawork makes it unbearable to watch.The action scenes make me so nauseous, were they filming during a magnitude 8.0 earthquake? The camera shakes so much that I'm worried my tv will fall off my wall.Shame, it has great potential but they ruined it with the camerawork."
9039,Vagabond,"This is the first time i am watching a series without realizing i was the end of every episode. the cinema thography, direction, and actors acting was superb and fantastic. i didnt believe it was korean drama for the first time, but it was."
9040,Vagabond,"Very good story , exciting and a lot of adrrenaline!! keep i t up"
9041,Vagabond,"Just finished ep 14. I saw LSG n Suzy (Main characters) said romance is only spoonful in this drama n that the shooting locations was in Morocco, Portugal n South Korea. So i really hope there will be a season 2 soon. Both leads carry the drama so good n tbh i couldn't wait for the next 2 episodes. So many unanswered questions which i dont think could fit in just 2 episodes.
1. What is PM Hong's true intention
2. Who is Samael
3. Hae-ri's story at the beginning of ep 1.
4. Why Dal Geon became a sniper.
5. Lawyer Hong's plot
6. N Vagabond itself - why n what Chief Kang n GI Tae Woon set it up for in the first place?As per ep 14., i believe Jessica is a pawn for the Hongs n i wonder if edward Park is also in the game. I truly hope for more romantic scenes between the leads cos i ship them so hard since Gu Family Book but i am happy so far with this drama n hoping n praying for more episodes. 💖💖💖21st Nov. I did some research while rewatching ep 3. The person holding Jerome was wearing this hat that has batch similar to ROYAL MOROCCAN ARMY. I Think the army guy took order from Samael. My suspicion is Samael is Edward Park. N he was the 1 keeping CDG alive so whatever his plot will be carried out. Vengeance could be the motivation."
9042,Vagabond,"For the love of watching series, i would definitely say it is an action packed that will really keep you on the edge of your seat, scences to make you feel your adrenaline rush. Every episode's ending is indeed a cliff hanger, bringing strong aspect of suspense, questions, doubts. finally, something you could say thank god it's not about love, romance or rom-com, fantasy, that are common in kseries. But i love their witty humor, their transition from a serious scene/script shifting to a comical one, they always have the right timing in it to blow a nice humour., i guess that is always their charm. For those saying that it is unrealistic must say the same thing on john wick. If you want realistic, watch biography or documentaries. Lol. When did an action genre comes too real? I mean, you have to consider the possibilities., yes the scene where they were ambushed was quite impossible, and when they are trying to bring the witness to the court as well, but hey! Like i said, in an action genre, you really cannot deny unrealistic ingredients in it. The depth of the story isn't that much at first but when they are getting too close to the truth, it shows and will end up in political motives. i would still give it a go and recommend it because of the thripoor suspense it gives you and the twist it tells you.
Cinematography wise in a series?, i've never had a better look than that of the peaky blinders' cinematography. It's one of the best. Not talking about big screens or movies in cinema. Just in series. For vagabond, the shaky effect of the camera during some of the action scenes is not really helping. They must really change or come up with a better idea rather than intentionally shaking the camera upon action taking., it annoys me as well. But that's it, other than that, nothing. Your time will not be wasted."
9043,Vagabond,"This series is amazing, their plot and stories look like something that usually happens when you have to deal with something that relates to government issue, i hope they can make the second season!!"
9044,Vagabond,Perfect serie cmon man its been a while since i get hyped like this this drama have everything badass charachters perfect fights good acting perfect story its amazing man brilliant
9045,Vagabond,"This is supposed to be foremost an action series then a K-Drama but I don't know what film school the director learned to shoot action scenes from but this ain't it. The most unnecessary violent shaking of the camera every single god damn time there's an action scene. Completely defeats the purpose and ruins any enjoyment out of it. Awful camera work took away from a decently scripted show, a damn shame."
9046,Vagabond,"Great but we need season 2.
Realistic choreography of scene"
9047,Vagabond,"I love asian shows, and this has jumped to the top of my list. Greatly anticipating a second season and can't wait for it to come out."
9048,Vagabond,"This is an amazing series ,
Which i cant wait for the second
I wish all should watch
It will make more sensation than money heist,
Which the action sequence and cinematography is amazing, the action sequence make to remember old Jackie chan movies,
And off course the direction is the best part
Amazingly made, and the script also there are so many twist and turns which makes very engaging until end.
This is the series which make me see more than two times.
And off course please make season two fast.
I highly suggest everyone should watch series.
If you not watch, you will miss the best serie...
Highly recommended..
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
9049,Vagabond,The series was very cool I love it but please when is the season 2 coming out.
9050,Vagabond,A thrilling Kdrama that has it all. Well recommended.
9051,Vagabond,What can I say... I literally finished this drama in 2 days. It's really interesting and the plot is very well made. I love the lead actors and the action scenes are greatly executed. I cannot wait for season two.
9052,Vagabond,"Honestly I'm unsatisfied with the end! I think I can write this in the name of the others too, we need season 2!!! It has a lot of unanswered questions. I'm curious about Dolgun's and Heri's romance! They're such a nice couple. The chemistry works well amomg them."
9053,Vagabond,"Good for entertainment. Not for your brain.
Not recommended."
9054,Vagabond,An awesome action drama that will keep you on the edge of your chair. This is not your typical korean drama because its quality is top. A new korean content that will surely suits the taste of international viewers. Got only spoonful of romance but the chemistry of the leads is perfect. The supporting casts are all versatile. The cinematography and actions scenes are all wow. Shot in Morocco and Korea. Will relate to whats happening around. The story is amazing. Awaiting for season 2! It must have season 2!
9055,Vagabond,Every episode is like a movie. The actors are all good. This kdrama is how an action-drama should be made!!!
9056,Vagabond,"You know its good when you just got stuck without even wanting to have a toilet break to a series.
Full of action, amazing cast and expect the unexpected."
9057,Vagabond,"Loved the first few episodes then it quickly spiraled down to sheer disappointment.. eg what happened between the love by the leading man/woman
This was my main interest as the film quickly added characters out of the blue.Why why do korean films focus on so much drinking.. Anyway you are blessed many beautiful women. I m a keen fan of Kfilms rate 6/10."
9058,Vagabond,The main character has such thick plot armor that towards the last episode you wish he was actually dead.The bad guys act very illogically when they should just pull the trigger on what is the dumbest main character of a korean drama series.
9059,Vagabond,"I'm not a fan of action series but this really hooked me from epside 1!! Love all the characters as well they really did a fantastic job! I don't think I've seen a kdrama leads talking in different language but in this you will have the luxury to see that!! AND Lee seung gi... is hust perfect! This role was made for him, hands down. everything in this series is unreal!!"
9060,Vagabond,I'm not often watching k drama but this show is something different from the others. A true masterpiece of storyline!!!
9061,Vagabond,"The Vagabond series tells the story itself, starting with Shadagon Stuntman, a young man who is involved in a tragic plane crash. In that flight, his only grandson was traveling with him. This incident was involved in national corruption. Leading to a global corporate network that caused this loss on the other hand, our young heroine, Gohairi, works as a foreign intelligence service. Under the National Security Service (NIS) until she accidentally met the hero Chadagon. During the investigation of the case of the plane crash. The pair must find a way to survive in a country full of killers who are hunting to silence this terrorism.As for the actor's hand ghost, Lee Seung Gi must say that he is doing really well. Well, roles of both action and drama have broken up. Considered very attractive when it comes to personal scenes when joining the scene with the heroine Bae Suzy. They are developing relationships gradually on the rise. From the very beginning that the male protagonist did not trust the heroine until when they both began to open up until it became a love that was just right in the drama line like this but I must say that the boys who have met such beautiful female protagonists more and more in the role of a spy who is both smart and good. You will definitely love her from the beginning. Vagabond series has been used in scenes from many countries. Korean, Portuguese, and Moroccan, the set design productions are stunning and instantly look like a giant series. The more it combines with the various action scenes, it is considered fun and fun, although some scenes or some characters do not look realistic and do not make sense. But the taste of fun is considered to be in the level of almost 10 ever and can be thrilled at every episode. Which now just ended the first season only, causing a lot of fans to watch and watch.While Vagabond isn't exactly the latest to Netflix, it is still at the forefront of the hit series, and every review site recommends it. Those who like a full-fledged movie with action, drama, romance and mystery that needs to be answered until the end of the story. It is one of the few Korean dramas that can hit the global market and it has also been recognized by audiences around the world as being stunning for all reasons. Season 2 is coming soon. It is very good. I will be looking forward to another vagabond return."
9062,Vagabond,"A stunt man sets out to avenge the death of his nephew, uncovering a massive conspiracy along the way.The first episode felt like a bit of a drag, I kept wondering why bits weren't cut , and then recognising someone from mobile phone footage seen a week or so prior seemed like a huge stretchbut once the action kicked in, all was pretty much forgiven.And let's set the record straight: the action is what we'll all watch it for albeit, the eye-candy of the female lead is a nice bonusI have watched the entire first series and I can tell you that some of them contain too much content, making the story too confusing, with the seeming knowledge of the episodes being almost completely funny for no reason or should. Is it too love or where? The storyline too much or the action looks too ridiculous. But overall, it's a good series that's well worth the time, having fun at some point, and it's deep to explore.However, this series could be a bit more rigorous - one or two episodes could easily be shaved off for a cut that's likely to be made - but with a fun storyline and lovable heroine, I would still rate it. Good with this movieThis movie caught my attention from start to finish. (As I was in control) and many people ignore all the worries I am talking about simply because TV and movie theaters are full of things these days! This might explain all the top 10 ratings you'll see here, even though Vagabond is just an entertaining series. But it can easily be skipped."
9063,Vagabond,This series was absolutely amazing until the last 20 minutes or so. Just save yourself the trouble and stop about 20 minutes before the ending or you might end up like me wondering why you bothered to watch it.
9064,Vagabond,This is my love. Very very nice. Wow goodddddddd.i love leeseung gee.
9065,Vagabond,I loved it but was dissapointed by the ending. I am waiting for season 2!!
9066,Vagabond,As for me the movie VAGABOND is very interesting but what I don't get is that is it the female special agent the (Black sun) ?..however you guys need to see to it and make season 2 already.
9067,Vagabond,"I saw the rating on IMDb and watched the first 10 minutes and looked interesting enough. It's been much better than I assumed based on the rating. Fantastic! It's a must see for all those who like good plot, mystery, thriller, and action."
9068,Vagabond,"IMHO the category for this movie should be South Korean fantasy
Above all my expectation, second one this year after Better Than Us.
My first Korean movie become a 1 day marathon on Netflix with popcorn and water :)))
Looking forward to see how it continues."
9069,Vagabond,"This series started with a bang and never stopped. I nearly binged it all before I realized it, the skip ahead was never a thought, every episode kept me on the edge of my seat. Well paced action that doles out the suspense and the who done did it in a very engaging way. Definitely worth the watch."
9070,Vagabond,"I really wanted to like this but it is so so unrealistic. Every time something happens I get frustrated because that's not how that works.
They could have put more effort into a compelling story line but instead they created a completely laughable unrealistic joke."
9071,Vagabond,"Loved this drama - great story, full of action and great great actors, but it can't end this way. Where is season 2?"
9072,Vagabond,Most people like this thus the high rating so i tried watching it.i'm on ep 8 but sad to say i am having a hard time watching this. the plot is good and very promising unfortunately most of the other things are bad for me.acting is badlead actor is too hot tempered and just keeps on shouting practically at everyone. how can you convince people to believe you if you keep shouting and picking fights with themstorytelling is badthings jump from 1 thing to another too suddenlythe build up to a suspense usually fails miserablythey come up with doubts and conclusions without setting the groundwork properlya lead actor who can't even pay rent and had to think very hard buying new shoes for his nephew suddenly has the money to buy his own plane ticket back to Moroccolead guy and girl doesn't jive in their characterscamera is too shaky in so many parts it'll make your head spini'll try to add more when i remember them... sorry for bad review but these opinions are hust my own
9073,Vagabond,"Was going to rate it with a 9 stars but the ending is so out there, I mean anyone could imagine anything... There is not a proper ending to the series and also many questions remain unanswered. If a season 2 is coming out then OK, otherwise its very confusing how the story ends.Besides that, great series! I recently begun to watch k-drama/romance series and this one was a great alternative action series with very good acting and very good scenario & scenes."
9074,Vagabond,Thanks best of all the Korean series I've watched we'll continue to watch for doing such a quality job we're waiting for season 2. TURKEY
9075,Vagabond,Everything is perfect but -1star for the scene that the leading actor know the scene he wasn't there and nobody tell him. It's like he just enlightment and it won't make any sense.
9076,Vagabond,"I am kdrama lovers n had watch hundreds drama. But for this one, i dropped it in eps 5 and skip to last eps and the ending ridiculous though. Plot is so so and what keeps disturb me is bad acting of female n male lead! Seriously, Shin Sung Rok and other supporting roles did their best but not for the lead. no chemistry."

9078,Vagabond,"I'm from Sweden and I'm used to watch American/European movies and series. This series popped up on my Netflix and I gotta say this series went above all my expectations. The female main character is my new crush, and the male character is a beast hahah! Strongly recommended!"
9079,Vagabond,"This show had me gripped from episode one! Perfect combination of action, corruption, romance, and wonderfully choreographed fight scenes. Seriously one of my favorite kdramas thus far. The plot twists keep viewers waiting impatiently for more with each episode. Highly recommend watching and absolutely cannot wait for a season two!!"
9080,Vagabond,Just watch this masterpiece holy molly its amazing the story line the acting the osts everything the main charachter is just beyond craziness cant wait for season 2
9081,Vagabond,"Every thing in this drama is just great beginning from the story to the music I loved it all.
But the end doesn't make any sense it's not ending anything!!!"
9082,Vagabond,The acting and the script are very satisfying. Season 2 should definitely come.
9083,Vagabond,"For the first time i'am review film. Sorry if my english not well. This movie totally amazing!!!
Thx for making this film."
9084,Vagabond,"This show was Beyond my expectation
every episode was amazing
we need season two 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
9085,Vagabond,I have never seen a show that bring so many emotions at the same time like this show. It has everything which is pretty hard to mix crime love friendship loyalty it has a little bit of everything which makes it the best. It has been a long time since I have watch a show so worth it like this one. It is so good that I am taking the time to rate it since I want to watch season 2. Awesome 👏 show.
9086,Vagabond,"Honestly there are many things that don't make sense in this series, the acting is wacky many times and not natural at all, the story itself is used up in korean dramas and movies, but with some special touches here and there..
In order to make Dal-gun a hero, they sacrificed all the other characters, no special agent even though they are armed can beat him, they don't shoot him as ordered because he said he will blow them up if he doesn't stop the timer, which is stupid, just shoot him and stop the timer yourself, he gets in the way of NIS investigations but they let him be even though they can arrest him for interfering with official missions."
9087,Vagabond,In simpler words-An amazing show in every possible way.
9088,Vagabond,"I rate this k-drama 7/10 and here is why.This drama had potential to become a 9/10 but sadly plateaed after the 2nd episode and remained an intense, action drama with little time dedicated for character development or romance.The storyline alludes to Ki Tae Woong's potential love for Go Hae Ri yet we, the audience do not know whether Go Hae Ri's kiss at the staff dinner party early in the drama is out of love or purely because she is drunk. This exact same situation occured with Cha Dal Geon and it is only at the very end of this drama that the audience have a definite conclusion, that she loves Cha Dal Geon and not Cha Dal Geon.Why does Lilly listen to Jessica Lee's orders when she dosn't have any money left in jail to pay her? Why is she still working with Kim Do Su? These are the charater development sacrificed for a drama with nothing more than action.There are several major plot holes such as in ep 14, the question I had was; how did Oh Sang Mi know Cha Dal Geon's phone number in order to call him?English words where often overused and made the drama 'fragmented' in the sense that it detached the audienence from what is really going on within the drama. I find that an occasionaly use of English words compliments a k-drama such as when korean actors are talking with English investors, but not to other korean actors or not as often as the question; do we just settle with the assumption that all of them know English? aroused within me.The overall storyline was also heavily predictable and contributed to this drama being slightly less enjoyable. A way to make it more exciting for me would have been either focus on developing Kim Do Su as a love triangle with Cha Dal Geon and Go Hae Ri more in the storyline, or make Lilly a main cast and go with a plotline along Cha Dal Geon being a ex-military soldier turned stunt-man where certain events developes a love relationship between him and Lilly, who turnes 'good'.A thing which defines k-drama is its OST music which often becomes a hit in korea music charts. This drama lacks this critical element and I suppose it is yet again due to character developent being sacrificed for a more action/suspense drama.On a final note, more character development is needed, OST music is essential and lacking in this drama and apparent plot holes have made be the score this drama a 7/10"
9089,Vagabond,"Forget about procastination. If you are like me who love conspiracies and suspense then this is for you.
I don't usually do movie reviews but I had to do this.
Check it out guys. It is just perfect."
9090,Vagabond,"A beautiful and wonderful series, there is no boredom moment, waiting for the second part, if any"
9091,Vagabond,"If you don't wanna regret, then don't miss it.One of the masterpiece i have ever seen. It contain the suspence in every episode.Mind blowing action and thrill. Desparetly waiting for season 2 cause in the ending of the season 1, it left us in a sea of thousand of question's."
9092,Vagabond,"This series takes the game to a whole new level !The scenario is fast-paced, and the action is breathtaking. Each character has its own charm, especially the protagonist : he show incredible resources and instinct in situations where he is clearly dominated. Moreover the actors do a very good job in showing emotions, and making the viewer feel them with his own guts. From sadness to anger, you get it all.This show also depicts a sad truth about political and economical powers, from complete disregard to the citizen they are supposed to represent, to oversized greed and of course the never ending obsession of power.Please watch this show, you will not regret a single minute of it !"
