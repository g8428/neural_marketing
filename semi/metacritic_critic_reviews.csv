You went to play kids’ games because someone told you you’d get all that cash. So then they had you play Red Light, Green Light, and they shot everyone who got caught. But when you said you wanted to go, they said, ‘Okay, just go,’ and you don’t know what they look like or where this all took place. Is that everything, mister?” ]"

2,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), the officer’s audience, once fully confident in his account of the games, the gunfire, and their grisly aftermath, goes from bold to sheepish as he hears his words echoed back to him. It’s a scenario too grand, too brutal, too inhuman to imagine: Somewhere, somehow, someone has accumulated enough resources to marshal a private army, tempt strangers from around South Korea into participating in a 6-stage series of “games” for cash prizes, kidnap 456 of those strangers, and hold them in an undisclosed remote location where the games commence. They are not fun. People lose more than an eye. It’s a horrific and miserable affair for the players. For the streaming audience at home, it’s colorful, shocking, and shamefully entertaining. It’s “Squid Game,” your new streaming obsession."
3,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Netflix’s latest (and completely unexpected) hit series comes to U.S. viewers all the way from South Korea, the land of Park Chan-wook, Bong Joon-ho, and dozens of other great filmmakers unknown to swaths of American audiences because Park and Bong are the only Korean names they have the bandwidth to remember. Maybe they’ll make room for Hwang Dong-hyuk, too; “Squid Game’s” popularity is quite possibly as much a surprise to him as to Netflix and to American critics, who can’t seem to find another reference point for the show than “Parasite.” Admittedly, “Parasite” does feel like kin to “Squid Game”: A merciless class critique focused largely on conflict whipped up between the have-nots by the haves. But that film and this show approach that motif from different angles and have little else in common. There’s no 1% class here. There are instead faceless agents of social attenuation. "

5,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Hwang’s lead is Gi-hun, though he’s merely one protagonist among an ensemble that includes seven others. Gi-hun has a problem: He’s a bum. He’s a bum for about a half dozen reasons, comprising a blend of bad luck and worse decision-making skills, but a bum nonetheless. With empty pockets on his daughter’s (Cho Ah-in) birthday, he goes to the racetrack, bets big, wins big, is shaken down big by friendly neighborhood loan sharks, and ends the evening a loser as is his habit. (He’s also divorced, in case that needs to be said.) Then, a stroke of fortune, neither good nor bad. Waiting for a train, Gi-hun meets a nameless nattily-dressed man (“Train to Busan‘s” Gong Yoo) who gives him a chance to make fistfuls of money by playing a game. The man leaves the details fuzzy. When, at the end of the first episode, “Red Light, Green Light,” the details come into sharp relief via the percussive reports of gunfire. "
6,Squid Game,69,7.1,"“Squid Game’s” influences are abundant. Beyond the works of Hwang’s South Korean peers: Films like “Battle Royale,” “Escape Room,” and E. L. Katz’s terrific “Cheap Thrills,” a movie about a bored married couple possessed of immeasurable wealth who pit two friends against each other in a series of sickening pranks and dares. “Squid Game” actually feels closest to that movie for sheer visceral impact; overarching commentaries on South Korea’s problems with wealth inequality and financial/political scandals, as in corruption perpetrated by the state-run developer Korea Land and Housing Corp., give Hwang’s story senses of time and specificity. But the questions posed by “Squid Game” and “Cheap Thrills” remain the same: How much does your loyalty to your friends, your family, and to your fellow man cost? What would you do to yourself and to others for a quick, easy buck, give or take several billion?"

8,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The stakes are so incalculable that judgment feels petty. “Squid Games” has no illusions about its characters’ relative morality; not all of them are “bad,” but practically none of them are “good.” Gi-hun is a deadbeat with a gambling problem, a guy who would steal from his own mother instead of getting a job; Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo), Gi-hun’s old childhood chum, embezzled so much money from his securities company’s clients that the cops are out for his arrest; Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon), a North Korean defector, is hellbent on getting her parents over the border by any means necessary; Mi-nyeo (Kim Joo-ryoung) tries to pass herself as a single mom to dubious effect; gangster Deok-su (Heo Sung-tae) is so in over his head with his own gambling debts that his organs are up for grabs. Elderly tumor patient Il-nam (O Yeong-su) and Pakistani worker Ali (Anupam Tripathi) are the 2 most moral people mixed up in the game. "
9,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Still, apart from Deok-su, “Squid Game” reserves scrutiny. There’s probably not a single soul out there who wouldn’t at least consider playing a life-and-death game where the prize is financial stability for life, and when the starting roster of 456 starts out trying to secure that prize for themselves, the impulse to condemn them for going with the flow disappears. Hwang puts so many people on the board that we immediately wonder if we, too, would sign away our safety for the chance at winning big. This, in the large tradition of “rich people make sport of the poor” genre niche, feels somewhat new. Even newer is the introduction of democracy into that class dynamic. In Episode 2, “Hell,” the players all vote to end the game in accordance with the rules laid out by their hosts. Amazingly, the game ends. "
10,Squid Game,69,7.1,"But the show goes on. Living on the precipice of bankruptcy isn’t a way to live. There is, perhaps, a conflict of a sort between “Squid Game’s” aesthetic and its material; Hwang gives the show a slick, handsome veneer, as rich in detail as the organization that’s behind the games is in resources. Grime clutters in the corners and at the edges, but for the most part, it’s barely window dressing. Whenever the plot takes us to the compound where the games commence, that grime disappears entirely, replaced by a visual sense best described as a head-on collision between M.C. Escher and “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.” It’s glorious and weird, a combination to savor in a series that demands savoring."
11,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Would “Squid Game” be improved with the addition of grit and grain? Probably not. It isn’t a series worth improving on, after all, an unpredictable smash that, like every South Korean show or film Americans latch onto, has unflattering views about the wealthy and a deft hand at turning class assessment into propulsive art. Hwang knows how much convincing he needs to do to bring his viewers on board with the premise; unlike the cop, the audience will buy into “Squid Game’s” world without a fuss, a credit to Hwang’s skills as a filmmaker and writer. Forget the negative connotations the phrase “bingeworthy” stirs up. In the binge era, this show is as good as they come. [A]"

18,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The biggest show on Netflix might just be a South Korean horror series with a cephalopod name and a violent, disturbing concept."
19,Squid Game,69,7.1,"By now you've probably heard of ""Squid Game,"" a dark social satire in which desperately impoverished people are enticed to compete in children's games with deadly stakes for the chance to win a life-changing cash prize. Since its Sept. 17 debut on the streaming service, it has become an online craze, sparking memes and fan theories and becoming the No. 1 show on the streamer in 70 countries, including the U.S., according to Netflix."
20,Squid Game,69,7.1,"We may never have appointment television viewing like ""Game of Thrones"" again in the streaming era, but amid the proliferation of content, streaming or otherwise, a genuine word-of-mouth surprise can still surface. And that's what's happened with ""Squid Game,"" which received virtually no press or marketing in the U.S. before its debut. It joins a recent list of successful foreign language series for Netflix stateside (including ""Lupin"" and ""Money Heist"") and will likely stay at the top of the pop-culture conversation as long as people keep telling their friends to watch. "
21,Squid Game,69,7.1,"So what it is about ""Squid"" (★★★½ out of four), that has so many people suctioned to their screens?"
22,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There is a visceral, primal, can't-look-away feeling to the nine-episode series, which traffics in gore but also deep psychological horror and disturbances. The protagonist is Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a divorced father who's a bit of a degenerate and a gambler. He's scraping by on the back of his elderly mother, whom he lives with while occasionally stealing her money. "

24,Squid Game,69,7.1,"After a brutally bad day, Gi-hun is approached by a smartly dressed young man in the subway, who offers him a chance to win money by playing games. After accepting, Gi-hun is whisked (or rather, gassed and kidnapped) to a deserted island, where he awakes in a dormitory with 455 other players. Among them is his childhood friend Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo), the bright kid who got out of the neighborhood, only to steal and embezzle, leaving him wanted and in debt. "
25,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The players sign a vague contract to participate in the games and get started with Red Light Green Light – but if they move when they're not supposed to, they are killed by sniper rifle. That's when the stakes of the game become truly real: If you lose any of the games or refuse to play, you die. The players are given an opportunity to leave, but the 45.6 billion won prize (equivalent to nearly $39 million) and the horrors of their own lives bring many back. Soon the players fear not only dying at the hands of the game masters, but by each other, as the worst parts of human nature come out. "
26,Squid Game,69,7.1,"""Squid"" is immediately evocative of similar films, shows and books including the 2000 Japanese film ""Battle Royale"" – about kids forced to fight to the death by a totalitarian government – and ""The Hunger Games"" series. What separates ""Squid"" is that the players in the game have a false sense of agency in their plight: As the game masters repeatedly say, they all chose to be there. But when their only other option is returning to a life of suffering that's worse, how is that really a choice?"
27,Squid Game,69,7.1,"""Squid"" harshly critiques society's economic inequalities, especially as the rich controllers and spectators behind the game are revealed. It takes specific aim at South Korea – a North Korean defector is a main character, who ruefully says she escaped the North for a better life in the South, only to find similar desperation – but it's universal in 2021, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare so many injustices.

29,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Superb acting performances heighten the drama, particularly from Lee, who makes Gi-hun irresistibly likable despite his many flaws. All of the characters undergo enormous trauma and transformation, and the actors rise to the challenge of portraying believable emotions in an unbelievable setting. "
30,Squid Game,69,7.1,"A big part of the series' success lies in its dramatic and eye-catching aesthetic. Director Hwang Dong-hyuk paints the surreal, colorful world of the deadly games like the backdrop of a video game, all exaggerated shapes and sizes and harsh edges that evoke pixels. Juxtaposed against the gray, gloomy streets of Seoul, where many of the characters reside, there's a feeling that the players have crossed over into Oz when they enter the game. "
31,Squid Game,69,7.1,"What makes it so well-suited for binge-watching is how well Hwang uses pacing and cliffhangers to make the series absurdly addictive. More than almost any original Netflix series, the endings of each episode seduce you into clicking ""next episode."" Each is nearly a full hour, but they never feel bloated or boring, like many streaming series do these days. The series is certainly disturbing, although its violence and gore never reaches the bloody levels of ""The Walking Dead,"" instead relying on an insidious psychological horror that wraps its tentacles around you."
32,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Trying to predict the next streaming sensation can be a fool's errand in the current era of television, but there is real delight in finding something without A-list stars, huge marketing budgets or the typical trappings of ""prestige"" TV that connects with so many people. ""Squid"" may be so popular because we're in a distinctly bleak moment in history, but connection over something disquieting is better than no connection at all. "
33,Squid Game,69,7.1,"And don't worry, no actual squids were harmed during filming. "

To
most of the world, money equates to survival. Apart from the richest few, people living in capitalist countries have to plan their lives based around their ability to make money: how they can leverage their skills into profit, what jobs have the best earning potential, how much they need to support their lifestyles and their loved ones. At some point, everyone has considered what they’re willing to do for money, and the answer to that question really depends on how desperate we are. So it isn’t unthinkable that someone might be willing to endure physical harm and vast risk for the chance to never have to worry about money again."
37,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The new surprise Netflix hit Squid Game plays off that idea, and turns it into a grim game. It starts with when someone offers a desperate man the chance to play childhood games, and wager on the outcome. As that offer escalates, it turns out that more than 450 other desperate people have been lured into a brutal life-or-death contest, where they’re playing popular childhood games for the chance to win 45.6 billion Korean won, about $39 million. The nine-episode Korean drama is one of a small handful of American Netflix’s many K-dramas that have crossed over into wide popularity, and cracked the service’s Top 10."
38,Squid Game,69,7.1,"And no wonder — it’s impossible to turn away from, even as it rapidly gets more brutal and bloodthirsty. A Battle Royale-type story where people are forced to kill each other for freedom and resources is nothing new. But Squid Game marks its own territory, first with its especially savage premise and the constant tension around life-or-death scenarios, and second, by focusing on each character’s decisions, as they struggle to choose between survival and humanity."
39,Squid Game,69,7.1,"In spite of the initial absurdity of the stylized survival games, Squid Game’s cultural context, motivations, and interpersonal conflicts are startlingly realistic. The show takes place in present-day Korea, and the players are culled from the margins of society. It seems like the entire game could be happening in secret today. Recent East Asian film and television stories like Parasite, Burning, and Itaewon Class have adeptly addressed wealth inequality and class struggle in real-world circumstances, rather than through the dystopian lenses of American fantasies like The Hunger Games and Elysium."
40,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Film director Hwang Dong-hyuk (My Father, The Crucible) follows this trend with Squid Game, his first drama series: In spite of the fantastical elements, the show seems to have been designed to show that our present reality can be just as hellish as any imagined world."
41,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Each of the series’ players have reasons to value the potential prize money over their own lives. The show’s lead, Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), owes a fortune to loan sharks and twice as much to the bank, but he wants to take care of his elderly mother and 10-year-old daughter. His childhood friend, investment banker Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo), has been stealing money from his clients. Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) is a North Korean defector who needs a house to get her brother out of an orphanage. The rest of the cast includes obvious good guys and antagonists, but they all have compelling enough backstories to explain why they would let themselves be lured into the Game in the first place."
42,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The game itself is a nightmarish childhood vision, where losing at a traditional Korean kids’ game (including universal games like Red Light, Green Light, or tug of war) means a bullet to the head, or a more gruesome death. Masked attendants in bright costumes machine-gun the field of contestants and collect their bodies after each event, placing the eliminated, both dead and dying, into caskets decorated as gift boxes. The players enter and exit the playgrounds through a pastel maze out of an M.C. Escher painting. Squid Game’s visuals, which juxtapose symbols of immaturity with graphic violence, add to the dissonance that powers the show. It all reads as ridiculous, frivolous fun that Korean adults normally only engage in if they’re celebrities on variety shows like Running Man or Knowing Bros — at least, until the bodies start dropping."
43,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Though a decent-sized subplot follows a detective who investigates who’s driving the competition, the game itself is more compelling than the mechanism behind it. The secrets ultimately don’t amount to anything more than what the players and viewers learn while going through the experience. The ride is much more compelling, especially because the game masters’ manipulation of the players, and the players’ manipulation of each other, both keep the audience guessing throughout. The audience is also led to feel the same absence of time as the players, who stay in a windowless compound regulated by lights-out and play times, with one round a day. The haunting score by Parasite composer Jung Jae-il adds to the constant tension."
44,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Squid Game, at its simplest, is nine-plus hours of watching average people, loaded with immense debt, make increasingly desperate and homicidal decisions while still trying to hold on to their humanity. The game attendants note at the start that all the players joined the game of their own free will, literally offering up their lives in exchange for a chance at something better. Once the game levels up, and victory involves consciously killing other people to get the largest share of the pot, the hope for wealth gets replaced by questions of humanity. These questions are deeply intimate rather than lofty. There’s no hand-wringing about capitalism and the state of the world, just the question of whether survival is worth watching a friend die."
45,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The show’s message sounds like a self-help idiom: A person’s choices make up their life. What you do with your circumstances is what counts. Squid Game is that ethos dialed up to a hundred. Who’s behind the curtain, what societal circumstances led to the Game’s founding, who knows that the Game is occurring, and who turns a blind eye — none of these details are the real point. The show succeeds because it creates two-dimensional characters and respects every choice they make, whether to help or harm, keep their humanity or sacrifice it for profit. While the game itself is a parable, the characters are fully, empathetically human."
46,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Watching Squid Game is uncomfortable. It’s tempting to fast-forward, either to skip the gore, or to bypass the sense of dread when the show stretches out some of the lethal rounds. While the discomfort could be written off as the price of admission for watching a death game, it really affirms the audience’s own humanity. If viewers don’t watch with a deep empathy for the characters, the show would be pure voyeurism, the entertainment of watching game pieces knock each other off the board. Hwang and his team take immense care with all of the players, laying out how they’re stuck in a horrible system, and just trying to make it through, at any cost. Squid Game is exciting, and startling, and tense, but that care is what really makes it worth watching."
47,Squid Game,69,7.1,All nine episodes of Squid Game are now available on Netflix.

49,Squid Game,69,7.1,This series was a real treat and I’m really hoping more people discover it.
50,Squid Game,69,7.1,"My only complaint is it probably should’ve ended about fifteen-twenty minutes before it actually ended but the ride was still great. Like a rollercoaster that’s finished rollercoasting but takes a little too long to trolley back into the station.
But if there’s a second season I’d definitely run through the queue to get on for another ride."
51,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Main casts’ performances are incredible. However, immersion was broken when the VIPs were introduced near the end of the show. Their scripts in English and voice acting really needed more work."
52,Squid Game,69,7.1,"All in all, for live action and this particular genre, the show is as good as it gets."
53,Squid Game,69,7.1,"About your spoiler, there’s a thread on r/outoftheloop (or however that subreddit is actually called) where someone gives an explanation. There’s a person that speaks in name of their friend who was one of the VIPs, and they say that they tried to talk to the director about some of the lines, for example the ""oh, it’s bigger"" line when shown the real glass bridge after seeing the model bridge. The director seems to have wanted them to play it just as it was written, actually being surprised that the actual bridge was big enough for actual people to step on, instead of the model for ants. So IMO it’s a problem of things being lost in translation, ESL writers and directors not understanding why certain things would be very grating. Here’s hoping that if there’s a second season, they hire a few English writers for those pieces."
54,Squid Game,69,7.1,"That kind of sounds like someone trying to rationalize why it wasn’t their fault how the performances turned out. The language barrier very well likely played into it, but all performances of all of the VIPs felt direct-to-video compared to the contestants we’d been watching."
55,Squid Game,69,7.1,"You do what the director wants you to do. If he tells you to read the lines as they’re written, you do the best you can and hope they know what they’re doing in editing. If those people also can’t hear the difference between a good line and a stupid line, welp, you’re screwed and people will think you did a bad job."
56,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Of course, I also don’t know more than ""I read some guy said he knew a guy…"", so yeah, it might just me rationalization without any truth behind it, but I find it could be pretty true."
57,Squid Game,69,7.1,"I am definitely not saying that the actors are exclusively at fault, or that the Reddit tale wasn’t real- I just personally think there’s very little evidence that the actors in those scenes brought anything notable, regardless of direction. If this was going into their portfolio, it would really have to be in the middle of their portfolio."
58,Squid Game,69,7.1,It goes both ways.

62,Squid Game,69,7.1,I guess I just lost this round…
63,Squid Game,69,7.1,"It’s sooooo sloooow.
if I want grim social commentary I’ll watch any number of films like parasite, anything by Ken Loach etc, if I want dystopian arena combat action then there’s BR, hunger games or the excellent Alice in Borderland. I just think Squid Game trys to be both and succeeds at neither.
An episode of Squid game just feels like 50 minutes of mediocre Korean kitchen sink drama with 10 minutes of mediocre action somewhere in it. There just aren’t any particularly engaging sub plots or narrative arcs to drive interest throughout the series and I’ve just found it really boring so far."
64,Squid Game,69,7.1,"You think it’s slow, I think it went by way too fast and really skipped over a lot of things. To each their own, I guess!"
65,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Yeah no I posted this after getting through the first 4 episodes, it does pick up the pace a bit later to be fair."
66,Squid Game,69,7.1,I started with this show totally blind to what it was about (without watching a trailer or the short info blurb about what the show was about) and I did not find it too slow.

71,Squid Game,69,7.1,"I mean, if we’re saying ""generally"", most Asian and European productions on Netflix are ""lousy"" and ""lowbrow"" too. It’s to be expected, given the sheer volume of content available. There’s a lot of quality stuff, but volume-wise Netflix is still king."
72,Squid Game,69,7.1,"I’ve found Netflix’ Scandinavian content to be mostly above average, especially their Swedish and Norwegian stuff."
73,Squid Game,69,7.1,"I agree on the cinema. It’s bascially what I watch the most on the channel. But the anime is mostly garabge tbh. And if it is good, it’s mostly older stuff I’ve alteady seen."
74,Squid Game,69,7.1,"What really bugs me though they don’t even have full series of the older series. 1 season of arslan, 3 of bleach, etc. Like i’m going to start sonething again only to not complete it."
75,Squid Game,69,7.1,Season 2 please.
76,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Also, I’ve been on a Korean show kick for roughly the last year plus and watched a bunch of great things."
77,Squid Game,69,7.1,"If they do a follow up I think the entire next season should be about soley taking down the Squid organization for good. Bunch of asshole rich serial killers. They say the games are ""fair"" which made me angry at their bullshit. They want to kill poor and destitute people for sport. People are not horses, so fuck the Squid organization, take them down Seong Gi-hun!"

82,Squid Game,69,7.1,Wut?
83,Squid Game,69,7.1,"I didn’t even know this existed until Friday just gone. Saw it was number 2 in the UK so out of curiosity put it on and I’m hooked. Just done the Gganbu episode and it broke me. My only criticism for the episode is I saw the twist coming, so should some of the characters. But aside from that, I’m loving it. Such a good show. The characters make this. 001 is a legend."
84,Squid Game,69,7.1,First show I’ve really loved since Dark finished.

91,Squid Game,69,7.1,The trailer alone left me feeling disgusted and upset enough. I cannot imagine watching this.
92,Squid Game,69,7.1,"I wish streaming services could produce movies/shows in the thriller/action/horror style genres that were not so completely consumed with extreme violence, gore and death."
93,Squid Game,69,7.1,Even the freaking Goosebumps movie they felt necessary to make R with extreme levels of mutilation/dismemberment! A kids book! I just don’t understand why everything must be pushed to the absolute limits of an R/MA rating.
94,Squid Game,69,7.1,All I can say is I wish Netflix would stop pushing their trashy sadism onto my Netflix home header.
95,Squid Game,69,7.1,Different stuff floats peoples boats – Clearly a large part of the streaming audience likes watching show with a focus on violence / death. Personally I find 99% of PG-13 movies that are in the thriller/action/horror genera rather boring.
96,Squid Game,69,7.1,Maybe there is a way for you to turn off Mature rated content on your Netflix? That way it would stop recommending things like that to you?
97,Squid Game,69,7.1,"What are you talking about? Both Goosebumps movies are rated PG, not even PG-13. And unfortunately most theatrical movies seem to be moving more and more into family-movie territory (superhero movies, Disney movies, etc) so really the only place left more adult-oriented stuff is streaming…"

99,Squid Game,69,7.1,Seems super neat. It’s on my watch list after being kind of super disappointed that Darwin’s Game ended up being the typical shonen harem anime kind of affair after an entire episode.

101,Squid Game,69,7.1,
102,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There is more than one Squid Game. There is Squid Game as a cultural idea, the Squid Game Vulture’s Joe Adalian wrote about as “Planet Squid Game”: the Korean Netflix series that has quickly become a world-dominating piece of television and proof of the streamer’s global reach. That Squid Game is a hilariously, almost perversely flattened version of the show itself — it is the Squid Game that exists so that Jeff Bezos can retweet “Planet Squid Game” as a congratulations for Netflix’s “internationalization strategy.” It’s also the Squid Game that has required Netflix to hastily slap together a merchandizing plan (customize a T-shirt with your own player number!), and will no doubt spark many industry conversations about what could be the next Squid Game."
103,Squid Game,69,7.1,"A weekly dispatch on the cultural discourse, sent Fridays."
104,Squid Game,69,7.1,
105,Squid Game,69,7.1,
106,Squid Game,69,7.1,"That version of Squid Game is real and potent, and it’s aided by elements of the show that are primed for cultural penetration. Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk’s direction and Squid Game’s overall visual design are so striking that images from the series can stand on their own, floating around the internet as pictures with detachable meanings. The first episode features a giant doll with a rotating head and an inescapable, perpetually darting gaze. She is a mysterious obsession, an embodied panopticon, an ironic image of outsize childishness returning to haunt us. Then there are the green track suits with their utilitarian, dehumanizing number badges; there’s the shot of Gong Yoo, calm and disarming, holding up the two red and blue ddakji envelopes. All of those images can refer to specific Squid Game scenes, but memes work by dissociating the image from the original context. The pervasiveness of Squid Game memes is its own kind of meaning, sometimes but not necessarily about the show, but more so about the way its imagery has been so quickly recognized and disseminated."
107,Squid Game,69,7.1,"But beyond that — or rather, before that — there is Squid Game the nine-episode Korean TV series, which has achieved this level of global recognition because it is distinctively itself while also playing in markedly familiar spaces. (If you have not seen Squid Game yet and your preference is to watch totally unspoiled by its premise, stop here.) The show’s closest relatives are Battle Royale and Hunger Games–style stories: people who are forced or recruited into a game where the only way to win is for all of your opponents to die. In Squid Game, the protagonist is a down-on-his-luck guy named Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), who finds himself deeply in debt, divorced, struggling to connect with his daughter, and guilty over his inability to support his elderly mother. He has a gambling problem. His debt is enormous — impossible to get out from underneath, and his creditors are closing in. And so, in the meme-able scene where he plays ddakji, an envelope-flipping game, Gi-hun gets enlisted into the Squid Game, a nightmarish facility isolated from the rest of the world where contestants play simple childhood games for the promise of huge wealth: 45.6 billion won, or approximately $38 million. The winner becomes immensely wealthy; the losers die."
108,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The connections to modern capitalism and the desperation of financial inequality is more explicit in Squid Game than in a Hunger Games–type setting. There is no veneer of fantasy or lightly rewritten place names to let viewers pretend that Gi-hun’s despair takes place in a faraway made-up world. Gi-hun is interested in the game because offering himself up to a stranger for potential financial gain seems safer than continuing with his life as it is, and later, because even the nightmare of Squid Game offers more possibility than the life he’d been leading."
109,Squid Game,69,7.1,"His fellow players are just as desperate. Squid Game populates the game with blunt, schematic character types (an old man, a criminal, an immigrant, a woman from North Korea, a guy who was superficially successful but secretly underwater, a married couple, a doctor, the one lady everyone hates), and if the show were less deft in the writing of Gi-hun or in the cruel nostalgia of its beautifully designed games, the oversimplified side characters might have been more of a detraction. The most frustrating among them is Ali, the show’s Pakistani immigrant character played by Anupam Tripathi, who barely gets more than a few wistful, guileless lines. The mysterious American VIPs introduced later aren’t much better, but they also don’t need to be; even without detail or particularly compelling performances, they fulfill the role Squid Game needs them to play. Sure, the economy might be absurdly complex and the causes of modern inequality might be multifaceted, but at the end of the day, there are some people who have more than enough, and Gi-hun and his doomed co-players are the have-nots."
110,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There’s a very small subgenre that Squid Game operates within (survive the brutal games to outlast the larger broken system), but it’s also playing in the broader, longer history of the social-experiment story. “The Most Dangerous Game,” Lord of the Flies, more contemporary TV shows like Amazon Prime’s The Wilds, and even the related group of post-apocalypse stories like the current FX adaptation of Y: The Last Man — there are lots of stories that let us watch human behavior play out in highly controlled, heightened scenarios. It’s as though the stark, rule-bound falseness of the experiment will let us see something about humanity that’s otherwise too hidden under social niceties and real-world messiness. The difference between Squid Game and a post-apocalypse show, though, is where the emphasis falls. In apocalyptic stories, the specific nature of the collapse becomes the social experiment: What if only people who lived in this tiny town survive? What if only people with certain characteristics make it? But there’s an inherent optimism in watching people struggle to look ahead. It’s a form of social experiment that hopes the experiment succeeds."
111,Squid Game,69,7.1,"It’s hard to not think about apocalypse while watching Squid Game. Or maybe it’s hard to not think about apocalypse because it’s 2021, and that’s when we’re all watching Squid Game. Whatever the case, although Squid Game does plenty of post-apocalyptic musing about how humanity might behave under extreme conditions, the sense of collapse is different. In Squid Game, as Gi-hun frantically scrambles to locate some bottom to the bottomless pit of inhumanity he finds himself inside, the show is most intense and horrifying, most fully and confidently itself, at the moments when there seems to be no end to the abyss. The show’s gorgeous, intense visuals work best early, when it’s still full of mystery, when the terrifying doll’s eyes see everything and there is no hope of escape. As Squid Game’s ending reaches for answers and for a future, it gets less surprising and less visually virtuosic. It’s not the kind of apocalypse story that longs for hopeful human resilience; it’s most eloquent on the topics of financial despondence and weaponized nostalgia."
112,Squid Game,69,7.1,"All of that makes Squid Game’s life as a triumphant poster child for global cultural dominance pretty dark. The show the whole world wants to watch right now is a show that’s best when it’s about realizing that the end has already come, and we’re all just grabbing at straws to distract from how bad it already is. That’s pretty bleak, but that’s also the way Squid Game would want it to be."

116,Squid Game,69,7.1,Netflix’s Korean thriller is on track to be the most watched series in the streamer’s history. It’s also giving people nightmares. What’s behind the disturbing series’ popularity?
117,Squid Game,69,7.1,Senior Entertainment Reporter
118,Squid Game,69,7.1,"It was a little over 40 minutes into the first episode of Squid Game when my eyebrow arched in confusion, I squinted closer at the TV, and, without realizing it, stopped breathing. Over the next minute, I reflexively started to lean back into my couch, as if my body was trying to run away from the TV, and began to make this weird combination gasp-yelp sound. I sort of shielded my eyes, but also couldn’t look away. I wonder if I’ll ever stop thinking about it?"
119,Squid Game,69,7.1,"When I talk about how disturbed I was by Netflix’s hit series Squid Game, it’s not in the way that, at brunch with friends, someone might exclaim, “Oh my God, you guys, this show totally creeped me out,” for dramatic effect and attention. The violence, the psychological warfare, the haunting real-world feasibility of something seemingly so outrageous: it pierces you, but then it stays there. It’s the show’s own brutal gameplay with the audience. A metaphorical stabbing."
120,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Few series in the age of streaming have ever become word-of-mouth phenomena at the scale and speed with which the South Korean thriller has since its Sept. 17 debut. Especially in this last week, that peculiar title—what the hell could a “Squid Game” possibly be??!—has been everywhere, spreading its tentacles, so to speak, to news headlines, social media feeds, and group texts, where friends and family debate each episode’s twists and commiserate over the trauma."
121,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Proving both how clever and exquisitely cinematic the series is, but also maybe how desperate people are not to be left out, Squid Game is currently the No. 1 show on Netflix in 90 different countries. The streamer is on record saying it is on track to be its most-watched series ever."
122,Squid Game,69,7.1,"So here we have this interesting dichotomy: Squid Game may be the most upsetting series I’ve ever seen, and it also may be the most globally popular series in modern times."
123,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The less a person knows about Squid Game, the better for their enjoyment. Or, um, the intensity of their waking nightmares after watching. (Good luck to all of us the first time we hear “red light” again.) But here’s a brief primer: The series, which can be watched on Netflix in Korean with English subtitles or dubbed in English, comes from South Korean director and writer Hwang Dong-hyuk."
124,Squid Game,69,7.1,"A down-on-his-luck gambler with a mountain of debt, Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), is recruited by a mystery man to participate in an ambiguous game that he promises will allow Gi-hun to settle his finances and start his life over. He arrives at a secret venue to find 455 other contestants—he is number 456—all in similarly dire straits, confused about what they’ve gotten into but tantalized at the prospect of a cash prize."
125,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Once they sign a strangely sparse contract, it is explained to them that if they make it through six games without being eliminated, they will win 45.6 billion won, or what amounts to $38.7 million. At first, these seem like childhood games, like Red Light, Green Light. (Squid Game, for example, is a variation on tag.) But the contestants soon learn—to their horror and the reason I may never sleep soundly again—that “being eliminated” means being killed."
126,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Anecdotally, I’ve noticed different reasons that people have become Squid Game evangelists."
127,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There’s a certain thrill to being as shocked and as horrified as the characters in each episode of the series. (The cliffhanger-happy series once ended an episode in the middle of such a tense moment that I impulsively yelled, “Fuck you!” at the TV. And then clicked play on the next one.) That’s intoxicating, even if it is rooted in such darkness, and people want to share that high."
128,Squid Game,69,7.1,"A more sinister extension of that is payback. Someone convinced me to traumatize myself with this show, so now I’m going to pass that on, until we’re all collectively disturbed together."
129,Squid Game,69,7.1,"More than one person has described the show to me as “fun,” which is absolutely wild."
130,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Watching the nine episodes is an intense experience. I think there’s a certain appeal in watching something that is so meticulously drawn. From the way the set pieces are laid out, the framing of certain (spectacular) shots, and the music cues, there is a morbid whimsy purposefully injected into the show. It’s black comedy at its bleakest, a tonal juxtaposition that is to be admired. I think it’s so effective, especially in a genre that is so extreme in its gore, that it masquerades as “fun.”"
131,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Then there’s the age-old reason: Curiosity kills the cat—or, in this case, the human spirit, which no longer exists after watching. Everyone is talking about it. Especially as it’s caught fire this last week, Netflix has dutifully made sure it shows up on as many home screens as possible. Who wants to feel like they missed out? (As someone who finished the season and may never smile again, maybe it’s OK to miss out!)"
132,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Watching Squid Game is such a visceral experience, but in a way that we’re not used to when it comes to television."
133,Squid Game,69,7.1,"We all have memories of the TV scenes that are so sad that just the thought of them makes you cry. (In fact, that was a viral meme on Twitter this week.) But the feelings I can conjure more explicitly are the times I watched something so upsetting that I nearly vomited—and in one case did. The hanging fake-out scene at the beginning of Handmaid’s Tale season 2. The beach scene in Years and Years. Now, any number of Squid Game sequences join the list."
134,Squid Game,69,7.1,"It’s funny how little patience we seem to have for things that make us feel good. The Schitt’s Creek final season into Ted Lasso season 1 admiration was short-lived to the point of receiving intense backlash this year over shows that are “too nice.” We keep finding our way back to the things that are disturbing. What’s interesting is who feels it intensely, and who arrives at it from a remove."
135,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The show is everywhere. It’s arrived on TikTok, where the hashtag #squidgame already had over 11 billion views earlier this week. People are having a blast making jokes about how they’d pose during “Red Light, Green Light.” That particular game’s giant porcelain villain is already achieving gay-icon status. The series has been meme’d countless times. The instinct to mine the series’ darkness for comedy is fascinating to me—or maybe that’s just an inevitability in today’s social-media world."
136,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Comparisons between Squid Game and both The Hunger Games and Battle Royale are obvious. One friend asked me why someone would want to watch something that’s like The Hunger Games, but more realistic. For a lot of people, that’s exactly why they’re so attracted to the series, which I think says a lot about us as a society. On the other hand, that’s also what makes the show so effective and its impact so undeniable."
137,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There is only one thing that I will slightly spoil, and it’s not the biggest plot point, but it’s important for talking about why the show works. Yes, an arena-style death match has been done before in pop culture. But what sets Squid Game apart is agency. The contestants choose to be there in the first place. And once they found out about the deadly repercussions, they were allowed to leave—and did. Then they came back."
138,Squid Game,69,7.1,"This isn’t government corruption and abuse as blood sport. It is desperation as blood sport. It is an indictment of the class divide that they become willing participants, twice. The stakes outside of the lethal games are as severe as the ones there."
139,Squid Game,69,7.1,I think we’re in the first wave of conversation/fascination over Squid Game’s unprecedented popularity. (I certainly am only in the first wave of NEVER SHUTTING UP about how traumatized I was by it.)
140,Squid Game,69,7.1,"It’s a foreign-language series that became an almost instant hit, at a time when Americans, whose pop-culture tastes have been notoriously xenophobic, are becoming more and more excited by global content. Like Parasite, it uses genre as a Trojan horse for discussions about capitalism and class. We’re a culture attuned to hyper-violence, but the series manages to show it in a way that you never become desensitized. What does that mean? (That’s not to mention how much we need to debate the ending, which I didn’t love…)"
141,Squid Game,69,7.1,"When it comes to talking about and dissecting Squid Game, we’ve only just heard “green light.”"
142,Squid Game,69,7.1,The vibes were actually good… until the most famous man in the world assaulted a beloved comedian. How do we reconcile that?
143,Squid Game,69,7.1,Senior Entertainment Reporter
144,Squid Game,69,7.1,"T
here was a time when we thought no one would ever care about the Oscars."
145,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Ratings had done a beautiful swan dive into a tropical lake of irrelevance. People complained about how the movies they actually cared about (starts with Spider, ends with Man) weren’t nominated. The Academy and producers had made several decisions that angered longtime viewers of the show, like excising crucial categories because they didn’t have famous people involved. A tear-jerking movie, the plot of which I can’t recount because it makes me weep inconsolably when I do—and yet was somehow dubbed an Oscar “villain”—won many awards."
146,Squid Game,69,7.1,"But then the most famous man in the world got out of his seat, walked onto the stage, slapped a beloved comedian, and continued to shout at him from his chair."
147,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Again, remember when we thought no one would care about the Oscars?"
148,Squid Game,69,7.1,"It’s a tragic thing, in multiple ways."
149,Squid Game,69,7.1,"It doesn’t matter that, for the first time, a streaming service (Apple TV+), won Best Picture at the Academy Awards for CODA, a seismic event in terms of how the industry thinks about how film is consumed. It doesn’t matter that it’s not Netflix that broke the barrier, despite its rich investment in filmmakers, like Jane Campion’s presumed favorite, The Power of the Dog. It doesn’t matter that it was possibly the most targeted and consequential night when it comes to Hollywood addressing—and moreover, representing—LGBT issues."
150,Squid Game,69,7.1,It was the biggest night in entertainment in my lifetime. Because of all of that. And also because Will Smith slapped Chris Rock and then won an Oscar.
151,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The question is: Were the Oscars good or bad? After what happened, I don’t know if you could possibly say one way or the other."
152,Squid Game,69,7.1,"First, there is the explanation that has to be done. Sunday was the Academy Awards. Many people, this writer included, thought they were going to be unwatchable. There were categories moved to pre-shows, presenters hired that made no sense, and all indications that the people involved in producing the biggest night in movies actually did not like movies at all."
153,Squid Game,69,7.1,"What they forgot, in all of their controversial producing, was that you just can’t produce good TV."
154,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Chris Rock made a horrendous, unforgivable joke about Jada Pinkett Smith and then her husband, now-Academy Award winner Will, slapped him in the goddamn face."
155,Squid Game,69,7.1,I guess the Oscars were good?
156,Squid Game,69,7.1,"I don’t know how famous you have to be that, when a comedian makes a really bad joke (to just define our take: so terribly bad) about your wife, you ignore the many television cameras that are filming the most hallowed night of Hollywood television, interrupt a live broadcast by walking on stage, slap somebody, and then from your seat scream, “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth.”"
157,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There is, apparently, an exact level of famous you have to be to do that, and that is Will Smith-level famous."
158,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Will Smith did something that the Oscars have reliably tried, but in their insecurity about ratings and buzz, very nearly thwarted itself from doing: creating a moment. It shouldn’t seem like rocket science, but apparently it is: When you put the world’s most beautiful and famous people in a room together and just set up a camera, you capture the weirdest, most beautifully out-of-touch shit."
159,Squid Game,69,7.1,"That can be a very positive thing. I don’t love that Jessica Chastain tied her speech back to Tammy Faye Bakker, whose legacy is… complicated. But I am grateful that she devoted so much of her time onstage to talking about the rights of women and LGBT people that are at stake. Only when you are that famous would you presume to have the megaphone for that. (Again, thank God she did!)"
160,Squid Game,69,7.1,It can also be a horrible thing.
161,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Let’s be clear: An assault happened. At first, every aunt, college roommate, and person I have ever met asked me if Will Smith getting angry at Chris Rock was a bit. While I’m flattered that anyone thought I had inside information, I can say definitively, at this point, it was not."
162,Squid Game,69,7.1,We’re so programmed to being programmed that none of us knew how to deal with it.
163,Squid Game,69,7.1,"In that moment and in his speech, Will Smith revealed himself to be a very famous person rendered very human. I do not condone his assault, but I understand the ethos. (Imagine any of these words ever being used in relation to the Academy Awards before.)"
164,Squid Game,69,7.1,"But again, I am trying to imagine just how famous and privileged you must be to—at the goddamn Academy Awards!—get out of your seat, slap someone, sit back down and heckle, and then win the Oscar."
165,Squid Game,69,7.1,It’s not that it’s great TV. It’s the kind of TV we still don’t know how to process.
166,Squid Game,69,7.1,"As mentioned before, there were substantial changes made to tonight’s ceremony in order to make it a show that anyone would care about, prior to the Will Smith of it all. The giant, taunting question was: How do you make people care about the Oscars who don’t care about the Oscars? You would think that’s a question a child would laugh at for being unanswerable. But the Academy braved it. They tried. Their response: Find Tony Hawk."
167,Squid Game,69,7.1,"God bless the producers for making the unnecessary presenter moment of Hawk, Kelly Slater, and Shaun White as bad as pundits predicted it would be. And also, drag the producers for the concept. Of all humans, Hollywood or otherwise in the world, these were the three brought on to introduce a tribute to James Bond."
168,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The ridiculous thing is that, besides all of that drama, the show was actually… going well? Amy Schumer’s opening monologue killed. It also had the Ricky Gervais-esque, Hollywood-skewering energy that people didn’t expect. (Who knew she’d go so hard on Being the Ricardos?) And Regina Hall proved why Regina Hall should be everywhere, in everything, in everyone’s mind."
169,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There was so much desperation that, on any Will Smith Didn’t Slap Chris Rock night, we’d be talking about it."
170,Squid Game,69,7.1,There’s been so much talk about how the Academy is chasing viewers who wouldn’t ordinarily tune into the show. I guess the mythological person they’ve been after is someone very excited to see Beyoncé dressed as a tennis ball? That’s what opened the show. (And Bey didn’t even win! I still don’t understand the politics/legality of inviting Beyoncé to an awards show and then not giving it to her.)
171,Squid Game,69,7.1,"In any case, was this year’s Oscars good? I’m better at the other question. Was it bad? No, absolutely not. That I’m so obsessed with the awards and can’t answer either way? Well, that: That’s a slap in the face."
172,Squid Game,69,7.1,“Keep my wife’s name out of your F*CKING mouth!” Smith shouted at the comedian in what definitely did not seem like a bit.
173,Squid Game,69,7.1,Senior Writer
174,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Shortly before he was poised to win his first Academy Award for King Richard, Will Smith made the Oscars theater incredibly uncomfortable—and confused the hell out of the viewers at home—when he appeared to confront presenter Chris Rock on stage for making a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s lack of hair."
175,Squid Game,69,7.1,"“Jada, I love you,” Rock said, before joking, “G.I. Jane 2, can’t wait to see it!”"
176,Squid Game,69,7.1,"He seemed genuinely surprised when Smith stormed the stage and slapped him in the face. Their extended exchange was bleeped by ABC but it was fairly easy to read Smith’s lips when he shouted, “Keep my wife’s name out of your FUCKING mouth!”"
177,Squid Game,69,7.1,"In an uncensored version posted to Twitter, Rock said, “Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.”"
178,Squid Game,69,7.1,"“Wow, dude, it was a G.I. Jane joke,” the comic added before Smith repeated his deadly serious plea: “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth!”"
179,Squid Game,69,7.1,"“I’m going to,” a visibly unnerved Rock said, shaking his head. He seemed like he wanted to say something back, but ultimately decided to move on and announce the nominees for Best Documentary."
180,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Last December, Pinkett Smith opened up about her struggles with alopecia, revealing that she had decided to shave her head instead of constantly dealing with hair-loss issues. “Mama’s gonna have to take it down to the scalp so nobody thinks she got brain surgery or something,” she posted on Instagram at the time. “Me and this alopecia are going to be friends … period!”"
181,Squid Game,69,7.1,"When Sean “Diddy” Combs presented next, he urged Smith and Rock to “solve this like family” at the after party."
182,Squid Game,69,7.1,Yarnell Sampson said the ICON Park drop ride should have stopped once his 14-year-old son began to panic as a heartbreaking 911 call was released.
183,Squid Game,69,7.1,Breaking News Reporter
184,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The Missouri father of the 14-year-old boy who died while on an amusement park ride in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday said his son knew he was in danger—and he wants to make sure no other child feels like that again."
185,Squid Game,69,7.1,"“He was panicking when he was going up,” Yarnell Sampson, the dad of Tyre Sampson, told WOFL. “He was explaining to his friend next to him, ‘I don’t know man. If I don’t make it down, please tell my Mom and Daddy I love them.’ For him to say something like that, he must have felt something.”"
186,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Sampson’s description of his son’s fear matches what a woman told a 911 operator just after the tragic fall. In a 911 call obtained by the Daily Mail, a woman claimed Tyre had not been secured in his seat prior to the slip."
187,Squid Game,69,7.1,"“They didn’t secure the seatbelt on him,” she said. He was also breathing just after the fall, she said, but because he had fallen on his stomach, no one could perform CPR. His arms and legs appeared to be broken, she said."
188,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The Orange County Sheriff’s Office is investigating Tyre Sampson’s death after he fell from the 430-foot drop tower Thursday. Sampson retained Ben Crump, famous for his civil rights and personal injury claims, who said a fun time at a park “should not have ended in tragedy.”"
189,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Sampson said the ride was the only one who offered to take his 6-foot-5-inch, 340-pound son, something he found suspicious."
190,Squid Game,69,7.1,"""This one particular ride said, ‘We can take you, come on! Get on!’” he said. “No one else allowed him to get on the ride, so I’m wondering what happened between now and then that made them say, ‘Come on, get this ride!’”"
191,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Sampson described his son as a star football player and honor roll student. Tyre, a St. Louis native, was in town with friends through his football program and had just come off a stellar season. He said his son had the NFL in sights for his future."
192,Squid Game,69,7.1,"“He was a team player. He was the type of young man that’d take the shirt off his back and give it to you,” Sampson said."
193,Squid Game,69,7.1,Now he wants answers as to why that young team player with a bright future was killed.
194,Squid Game,69,7.1,"“This should never happen to anyone else’s child ever again,” Sampson said. “If I have anything to do with this, it will not happen ever again.”"

197,Squid Game,69,7.1,"With its simple yet brutal premise that dials right into the recent boom of class-warfare stories, Squid Game is an unsubtle but riveting show fast becoming a global phenomenon. The groundwork for the show’s success (it’s currently on track to become Netflix’s biggest original series of all time) has been laid as far back as 2000, when Japanese horror Battle Royale garnered a cult following for its ruthless teen murder games. More recently in 2019, Todd Phillips’ Joker and Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite swept awards season with their two vastly different takes on the cavernous divide between rich and poor."
198,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Squid Game exists right in the pit of this divide, where 456 desperate individuals attempt to survive six violent interpretations of children’s games in the hope of scoring a life-changing 45.6 billion won (around £28 million). Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk demonstrates a real inventive flair when it comes to the tournament itself, from the presence of a chilling, pigtailed mechanical doll in the opening game, to the uniforms that distinguish the contestants from the elusive masked guards; teal tracksuits for the former, hot-pink boilersuits for the latter."
199,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The clinical execution of violence is heavy and relentless from the off. Contestants are shot en masse at close range, blood drips off swing sets, and a vicious nocturnal riot is captured via infrared. As the games roll on, an entertainment element is introduced to further twist the already rib-deep knife buried (mostly) figuratively in the contestants’ sides. "
200,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Its final act twists feel thrilling thanks to Hwang Dong-hyuk’s taut, precise script."
201,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Yet there’s heart to be found in the macabre parade of human suffering. Enemies are made amongst the ranks of survivors — notably Jang Deok-su (Heo Sung-tae), a surly gangster with a face tattoo of a gun — but so are allies. Among them are Kang Sae-byeok (standout newcomer Jung Ho-yeon), a pickpocket and North Korean defector who plans to use the prize money to get her remaining family over the border. Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) is a gentle older contestant who suffers from a brain tumour, and on the guards’ side there’s Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon), a cop who has infiltrated the game with the aim of finding his missing brother."
202,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Hwang weaves poignant details about Gi-hun and his comrades into the story as he moves frenetically between games, all while ending each episode on a tantalising cliffhanger. Bolstered by unwaveringly engaged performances from Lee and his central co-stars, each backstory pushes the emotional stakes of the show to painstaking new heights, which, when matched with its rising body count, makes for moments of raw tragedy."
203,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Even with its final act twists — which feel thrilling thanks to Hwang’s taut, precise script — Squid Game doesn’t say much about privilege, poverty and cruelty that hasn’t been said already. Yet with its propulsive storytelling, robustly drawn characters and thoughtful dialogue — which, it has been discovered, should be watched with ‘English’ rather than ‘English CC’ subtitles on Netflix for a more nuanced translation – there’s still plenty to enjoy within these familiar themes. That Squid Game also manages to be one of the most visually exhilarating shows of the year is a delightful if often gruesome bonus."

212,Squid Game,69,7.1,This post contains spoilers for Squid Game.
213,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The first half-hour of Netflix’s new top-ranked show, Squid Game, introduces Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a middle-aged gambler so down on his luck that he steals money from his elderly mom and gives his young daughter a gun-shaped cigarette lighter for her birthday, because it was the only thing he could get out of the claw machine where he inserted his last coins. After meeting a well-dressed recruiter in a train station, Gi-hun agrees to a money-making opportunity. He gets in a van, is knocked out by gas, and wakes up in a dorm with more than 400 others. A voice from a loudspeaker tells them that they will compete for a lot of cash—how much, they don’t find out quite yet, but it turns out to be 45.6 billion South Korean won, or about 38 million American dollars—by playing children’s games."
214,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Here starts the bloody part. The group is herded into another huge room, painted incongruously with a bright preschool color scheme, to play a game of Red Light, Green Light. They find out quickly that the price of remaining in motion after the creepy pigtailed robot in charge says “Red Light!” isn’t just disqualification—it’s a bullet. Before the end of the game, about half of the participants are straight-up murdered. This is not a show for viewers who dislike seeing people shot at close range (or stabbed, or killed by falling from a height, and so on). There are literally hundreds of such deaths in the show’s nine episodes, with a bonus dissection scene, if what you really crave is to see some intestines. And almost everybody on the show is afraid, all the time—the actors are constantly trembling, crying, and shaking, under the most extreme forms of duress."
215,Squid Game,69,7.1,"If you can stand all that, you should watch this show. In some ways, Squid Game, directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, is another familiar entry in the “Deadly Game” genre. It’s like the movie Cube (1997), in that the players wear jumpsuits that strip them of their individuality, are trapped in a hermetic environment that looks computer-generated, and try to solve puzzles before they’re horribly murdered—but in Squid Game the staff running the game are visible, and there are many more contestants. It’s like Battle Royale (2000), though the players are adults, not teenagers. It’s like The Hunger Games, though the larger society outside the game is not a fictionalized dystopia, like Suzanne Collins’ Panem, just everyday South Korea. It’s like the movie Gamer (2009), though the players are not controlled from afar by rich people who want to experience peril without personal risk—they’re just watched, up close, by rich people who want to experience peril without personal risk."

217,Squid Game,69,7.1,
218,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Squid Game is different from its genre cousins in one major way, and it’s the one that gives the show its emotional punch. The players must decide that they want to be part of the game. After the opening massacre, the group takes advantage of a clause in the contract they signed, and votes, by simple majority, to end the game and go home, without anyone getting the money. They are home for a short while, before they all end up back in the van, submitting to the sleeping gas, on the way back to try for the prize."
219,Squid Game,69,7.1,"They are simply too desperate—indebted, like Gi-hun; refugees, like Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon, a mesmerizing presence on screen, and a fan favorite), a defector who needs money to bring her family from North Korea; undocumented immigrants, like Abdul Ali (Tripathi Anupam), a big-hearted Pakistani father whose employer is stealing his wages. They would rather try for a big payoff, see a lot of people die, and possibly die themselves, than waste away slowly in the real world, trying to achieve something that seems impossible."
220,Squid Game,69,7.1,"They’re not all “good” people. The primary villain among the players, Jang Deok-su (Heo Sung-tae), is a gangster who owes money to other gangsters. Deok-su is comically evil, resorting to outright murder of fellow players when he realizes that every death gets him closer to the prize money and that the staff will do nothing if he kills outside of the context of the games. And there’s another villain, whose identity I won’t spoil, who does something unforgivable to a fellow player that will absolutely break your heart. The fate of the more sympathetic characters among them is where the drama lies."
221,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The ins and outs of the games are thrilling. When the team of scrappy protagonists—male and female, young and old—tugs and tugs at a rope, trying to drag a much stronger, all-male team over a precipice, I cheered for every step back they took, even though them winning would mean a bunch of other people would get crushed to death. When Ji-yeong (Lee Yoo-mi), a woman who killed her abusive father and has just left prison with no money or friends to her name, sacrifices herself for Sae-byeok, I wept. When the contestants get to the eponymous Squid Game—a contest of offense and defense, so named because the grid that kids play it on is drawn to look like a squid—the drama had me looking at my phone to escape the tension. That’s what watching a good game will do to you."
222,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Yes, I know, there’s some irony in the fact that a show that’s partly a moral commentary on the evils of spectatorship is No. 1 on Netflix. Few people are immune to the draw of watching others play hard and crafty, when the stakes are high. But, as the snippet of news about rising rates of household indebtedness in South Korea that plays in a hair salon in the last episode makes clear, the other big idea of the show is financial desperation, and what it does to people when they get on the wrong side of a bad system. As Gi-hun, who turns out to have a much richer backstory than I’d thought, says defiantly at one point: “I’m not a horse. I’m a person.” I can’t wait for Season 2, to find out how they play it."

277,Squid Game,69,7.1,How desperate do people get when they are deeply in debt? Desperate enough to play kids’ games with life-and-death consequences? That’s the idea behind the new Korean drama Squid Game. What does all of this have to do with squid? Read on for more.
278,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Opening Shot: A black-and-white scene of kids playing a pretty complex game called the “squid game,” because the playing field was shaped like a squid. A voice over of a grown up recalls the rules of the game."
279,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The Gist: Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), who lives with his mother (Kim Young-ok), is so broke that his mom has to give him money to take his daughter Ga-yeong (Jo A-in) to dinner. He asks to borrow more so he can get her a proper gift. He then takes the money to a betting parlor, where he somehow manages to win an exacta on the last race he has money to bet on. But as soon as he gets that money, a group of goons descend on him because he owes a loan shark lots of cash. He tries to give them his winnings, but a young woman picked his pocket when he ran into her while running from the goons."
280,Squid Game,69,7.1,"After singing a document that says he’ll lose a kidney and an eye in a month if he doesn’t pay, he has a birthday dinner with his daughter at a street food stand. She tries to tell him something, but he’s busy giving her a gun lighter for a present and promising to do better next year."
281,Squid Game,69,7.1,"A beat up Gi-hun meets a man in a suit (Gong Yoo) in the subway station. He offers money if Gi-hun wins a simple flip game. Gi-hun loses more often than he wins, but all he has to endure if he loses is getting slapped. He gets slapped a lot but comes away with a hunk of change. The suit man knows a lot about Gi-hun and offers him more money if he wants to join the game he reps."
282,Squid Game,69,7.1,"At first he’s resistant, but when his mother tells him that his daughter will move to the U.S. with her mom and stepdad, and the only way to keep her in South Korea is to prove he can provide for her, he calls the number on the card he gets. He goes into a van and is knocked out by a sleeping gas."
283,Squid Game,69,7.1,"He wakes up with 455 other people, all wearing green jogging outfits; they each have a number. He’s number 456; he finds an old man, Oh Il-nam (Oh Young-soo), with the number 001. Also there is Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) — Number 067 — a North Korean immigrant who was the one who picked his pocket, and his old college friend Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo) — Number 218 — who was at one time a successful investment banker. Everyone playing the game is in some sort of massive debt, and those who finish the series of games the masked gamemasters propose will win billions of won."
284,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The first game is “Green Light, Red Light,” where a massively large child statue calls “Green light” or “red light.” Whoever moves on “red light” gets eliminated. But what Gi-hun and the others don’t realize is exactly what the term “eliminated” means."
285,Squid Game,69,7.1,What Shows Will It Remind You Of? The Hunger Games mixed with the more colorful — but still sinister — environment of Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory.
286,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Our Take: You can tell the difference between a Netflix-commissioned K-drama like Squid Game and ones that the streamer licenses from other networks and studios. The season is only 9 episodes, dropped all at once. And the story is tighter, not meandering into asides and going on for feature-length runtimes. Another show like that was Sweet Home, and Squid Game has that same feel; a tight narrative and a story that has the potential to be tense and exciting."
287,Squid Game,69,7.1,"It’s a very creative concept; these downtrodden people, desperate to get out of their various debts, are playing kids’ games. The entire environment where the games go on is full of sun, colorful rooms, and unending stairways. The games almost seem whimsical, until you see what’s going on behind the scenes. There’s the masked operators, the gamemaster in charge, with a bronze mask with evil-looking eyes, the floor grid with everyone’s picture and number on it, with the pictures disappearing as people get eliminated. It’s creepy but it draws you in."
288,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The first episode does take a while to set up these games, as we get an idea of why Gi-hun would be desperate enough to submit himself to such a gamble. But it gets to the heart of the matter relatively quickly, especially compared to most of the K-dramas we’ve seen on the service. As we get to know the survivors around Gi-hun as the number of players is winnowed down, we should get a better idea of their stories. But in shows like this, it’s hard to know how long some of those people will make it before being, um, “eliminated.”"
289,Squid Game,69,7.1,"That’s the potential thrill of Squid Games; who stays, who “goes”, and how creepy each successive game gets. It’ll be interesting to watch self-interested people like Gi-hun or Sang-beyok forced into alliances to stay in the game, and how people will turn on each other once they know what’s at stake."
290,Squid Game,69,7.1,Sex and Skin: None.
291,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Parting Shot: Those who survive “Green Light, Red Light” see the roof on their sunny playing field close; we pan back to see that the field is incorporated inside a mountain on a rugged, remote island."
292,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Sleeper Star: We like Oh Young-soo as the elderly Oh Il-nam; he knows he’s dying but loves to play games, so the guy has nothing to lose."
293,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Most Pilot-y Line: There are some closeups of players getting “eliminated” that are very cartoon gory, sort of like the gushing blood in the Kill Bill films. Even though it looks outlandish and unreal — the blood is damn near cherry-colored — it still may make some of the squinchier viewers a little ill."
294,Squid Game,69,7.1,Our Call: STREAM IT. Squid Games takes a fresh idea and spins it into a thrilling drama; we hope it continues to build the tension we saw in the last 20 minutes throughout the season.

329,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There are reasons, to be sure. Korean pop culture has become a global powerhouse; people everywhere are happy to open that door. It has suspense, an increasingly sympathetic lead, looks great and has been erected on a time-tested plot structure, with more than a little heart to offset a sadistic premise you are invited to find repellent and attractive at the same time. It’s a little sad but not at all surprising to consider that this is what global humanity wants to watch — at least for the couple of minutes Netflix reportedly accounts a viewing — but then again it is not far outside the moral universe of your average modern-day superhero flick. Which also makes me sad."
330,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Technically, some minor spoilers may follow here, but on the other hand, this genre is well established enough that, unless you have the cultural memory of goldfish, you can extrapolate from the first episode much of what occurs in the following eight. It’s clear from the beginning that we will be revisiting the old theme of the powerful rich exploiting the powerless poor for their twisted amusement, along with the familiar conceit of games that leave the losers dead, which go back to the old Roman epics, through TV’s “The Avengers,” “The Hunger Games” and a zillion other works of imaginative fiction."

336,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is in debt all over town, divorced with a daughter he loves and repeatedly fails, and living with an aged, ailing mother who would like him to get his act together. Nearing 50, he is an irresponsible child who somehow believes that his typically bad luck will turn good betting on horses."
337,Squid Game,69,7.1,"One not very fine day he is approached by a well-dressed man on a subway platform who engages him in a game of chance — if he wins, he gets money; if he loses, he gets slapped — and leaves him with a card which leads to an invitation to participate in a more serious competition. After something like the opening of “The Prisoner,” he finds himself in a remote, unknown location, in a giant dormitory along with 455 other poor suckers who have also agreed to participate in six games — children’s games with, it soon transpires, a bloody twist, of which the titular Squid Game is one. Whoever’s left standing when the fun is done takes home a giant pot of money."
338,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk, whose film career is marked by its variety, does not have a history with genre pieces, and there is some serious exploration of social and character dynamics in between sequences of mass carnage and gladiatorial combat. As these things go, “Squid Game” is fairly thoughtful, and the fact that there is no sexual component to the violence is something in its favor. Some themes will obviously have special resonance for Korean viewers: one character, Kang Sae-byeoka (HoYeon Jung), is a North Korean defector trying to get money to bring her mother south. But the players’ stories are all relatable across borders, and the central characters are well developed enough that you have some investment in their fate; Lee and HoYeon do especially well at peeling away layers of caricature to find the people within, even as extras fall dead around them while explosive squibs squirt blood from their chest or head."

389,Squid Game,69,7.1,"WHAT IT'S ABOUT A mysterious man has selected 456 people out of the vast population of Seoul for a chance to play a series of games on an island off the South Korea coast. Winner takes all, or specifically the equivalent of about $40 million. Most of the players are broke, notably divorced father Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) who's chased down by gangbangers to pay back his gambling debts. When the 456 begin to play — adult versions of ""Red Light, Green Light,"" marbles, hopscotch and a popular Korean child's playground activity called ""Squid game"" — they learn the rules the hard way: If you lose, you die. In fact (spoiler alert) nearly all will, under the watchful gaze of someone called ""The Front Man."""
390,Squid Game,69,7.1,"MY SAY On the month anniversary of launch (Sept. 17), ""Squid Game"" is king of the world, or streaming world anyway. One hundred and eleven million ""views"" (a Netflix record) and soon, the most viewed piece of content on Netflix ever. ""Bridgerton"" (685 million total hours viewed) still holds that record, but the crown is about to pass."
391,Squid Game,69,7.1,"All these records and views tend to raise questions and you don't have far to look for answers either because the internet is full of them, specifically this: That ""Squid"" is a parable on predatory capitalism (it is indeed) which has resonated with cohorts of the 99% because they've found a reflection of themselves in these besotted game players."
392,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Maybe. Maybe not. Big numbers are one thing, the motive behind them another. Does the vast popularity of ""Bridgerton,"" for example, indicate some sort of hidden worldwide nostalgia for Regency-era London?"
393,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Moreover, dystopian fiction has always done something like ""Squid Game"" — the hardy band of survivors fighting the powerful elite … the have-nots vs. the haves … good vs evil. That evil triumphs here is hardly a departure from genre convention either. Dystopias aren't supposed to have happy endings."

395,Squid Game,69,7.1,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
396,Squid Game,69,7.1,"So why? For that, go to Occam's razor. Maybe it's just because ""Squid Game'' is a well-produced thriller with a couple of decent twists and a whole lot of violence. Violence always sells and has certainly helped to sell this."
397,Squid Game,69,7.1,"""Squid Game'' also has a particularly good ensemble cast. Each is someone you know or at least have seen on-screen countless times, their plights (and degradation) relatable. There's the gangster Jang Deok-su (Heo Sung-tae), with his sneer and cold reptilian gaze. Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon) is the resourceful hero cop we're all rooting for. Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-Soo) is the Wall Street investment type with the Dudley-do-right demeanor. Oh Il-nam (O Yeong-su) has one last shot at an elusive payday before he dies from a brain tumor. Series breakout Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) is a North Korean defector with hidden motives."
398,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Gi-hun is our lifeline into this dark world, our escape hatch too. Every fictional dystopia needs a Seong, otherwise it'd be overwhelmed by despair, or in this case, the Candyland aesthetic of all those deadly game rooms."
399,Squid Game,69,7.1,"And much as the characters are manipulated by the Front Man, we too are manipulated — baldly, mercilessly, and cynically. Best not to get too close to a favorite character, lest they abruptly leave both the game and our affections."
400,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There's nothing especially original here and the creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, has nearly admitted as much in various interviews. A veteran filmmaker, Hwang wrote ""Squid Game"" in 2009, during a particularly bleak period of his life, while gorging on manga comics like ""Battle Royale,"" which also inspired ""The Hunger Games."" Nevertheless, there is an auteur feel to all this, and the sense that a real flesh-and-blood person created the series as opposed to a committee. Maybe that's what's best of all or at least most noteworthy. This is an original Korean TV series, and not just one more procedural off the Warner assembly line. The world, after all, is a big place. Shouldn't television reflect that too?"
401,Squid Game,69,7.1,"Yet dark-brutal-bloody ""Squid Game"" remains a trip through Dante's 9th circle of hell (treachery) with frequent side-trips to the 7th (violence.) Proceed with caution, if at all."
402,Squid Game,69,7.1,"BOTTOM LINE Solid thriller, good twists, too violent."

422,Squid Game,69,7.1,By Daniel D'Addario
423,Squid Game,69,7.1,
424,Squid Game,69,7.1,This review contains spoilers for the plot and ending of “Squid Game.”
425,Squid Game,69,7.1,"To American viewers, “Squid Game” may seem to have emerged from nowhere. But it is a pretty unsurprising smash hit."
426,Squid Game,69,7.1,"The show, which Netflix chief Ted Sarandos has said is on track to become Netflix’s most-watched series ever, has dominated charts the world over, serving as striking proof positive of the streamer’s global strategy. And while it’s cheering that quite so many people are curious about a project that they’re watching with subtitles (or dubbed), little feels novel about people flocking to a project that allows them to have it both ways."
427,Squid Game,69,7.1,"“Squid Game,” created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, depicts a competition with some 456 entrants, in which boundless wealth is made available to whomever survives a brutal gauntlet of fatal events. These stages are borrowed from children’s playground activities, lending a certain simple irony to just how brutal they become: More than half of the competitors are gunned down, for instance, in the first stage, a version of “Red Light, Green Light” in which those who move after “Red Light” are gunned down."
428,Squid Game,69,7.1,
429,Squid Game,69,7.1,
430,Squid Game,69,7.1,"This sees more than half the competition — some 200-plus people — shot down, and “Squid Game” is hardly shy about showing viscera. The violence is at once eerily intimate and impersonal: While there’s a brutal frankness to the way the competitors’ lives are cut short, the shooters are masked game employees (or, in the case of Red Light, Green Light, a robotic doll). Death comes doled out by random functionaries, about whom we know significantly less than about the game’s players. What we gradually learn, through the device of a detective who’s broken into the system, is that they are utterly bought-in, obeying rules of their own and believing rigidly in a game they’ve worked to present with a certain baroque innocence."
431,Squid Game,69,7.1,"This fact — that both gameplayers and gamemakers are bound by need and by a strange loyalty to the rhythms of the competition — has clean, uncomplicated lines. It’s structurally sound and seems, at a glance, clever. So does the show’s structure in its early going, as surviving players are allowed the opportunity to leave after the first bloodbath, and end up returning of their own free will because they need the money that badly. (Their situations represent a legitimately interesting cross-section of contemporary Korean culture, including a North Korean defector and a migrant worker from Pakistan.) Having now seen both the harsh realities they face in the game and at home, we’re forced to reckon with the notion that infinitesimal odds of survival in the Squid Game might just be better than none in modern society."
432,Squid Game,69,7.1,"But this is a starting point from which the series does little in the way of development. “Squid Game” amplifies itself endlessly, raising the stakes and the level of inhumanity. (Its opening salvo of hundreds of dead bodies seems difficult to top, but it gets over the line in demonstrations of players’ brutality, which alternates somewhat schematically with their startling shows of kindness.) Show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has emphasized that he wrote the script for the series in 2008, before encountering recent projects with similar plots, like “The Hunger Games” book and film series. If we’re comparing the two, I’d argue that “The Hunger Games” series more clearly indicted the audience, which may be why its final installment represented a fall-off in popularity and why it’s infrequently discussed today. No one wants to be told they’re wrong for enjoying what they enjoy. Indeed, the piece of art this most clearly brought to mind was the significantly more flattering 2019 film “Joker.”"
433,Squid Game,69,7.1,
434,Squid Game,69,7.1,
435,Squid Game,69,7.1,"There, as here, violence is depicted flatly, and the embellishment comes from the fussy trappings around death and gore. Murder is fetishized as a way to raise the stakes in a hazily political conversation without proposing a solution. In both “Joker” and “Squid Game,” the concept of economic equality floats thickly in the air before the killings start, with “Squid Game’s” broad cross-section of the modern Korean underclass ultimately explored more as avatars of unluckiness or unfairness than as characters. And in both cases, exactingly composed visual landscapes — respectively, 1970s-Scorsese homage and playland-esque neons and rustic imagery of childhood — seem to have been staged in order to be disrupted by death. (It’s worth noting that much of “Squid Game’s” nostalgic visual palette is drawn specifically from Korean culture, an element about which a white American critic lacks a granular understanding.)"
436,Squid Game,69,7.1,"As the series runs on, it becomes clear that the Squid Game exists for many reasons, including for the harvesting of human organs from the killed and to provide amusement for a chattering class of wealthy people — some of them depicted as white Westerners — who bet on the results. About the first there seems little to say, other than that it’s impressive that the series found a way to be even more affectedly direct and unbothered about showing ways the human body can come apart. About the second, there seems insufficient irony or even meaningful appreciation that the show is encouraging its audience to do much the same thing as the much-loathed spectators. One fellow, for instance, shows up at the Squid Game viewing party and immediately starts threatening and violating someone who he believes to be a young functionary, culminating in an attempted coercive sex act."
437,Squid Game,69,7.1,"It’s telling that the show feels the need to push this hard to insist that the people who’d watch the Squid Game for entertainment are so much more morally degraded than people who’d, say, simply watch “Squid Game” for entertainment. Like “Joker,” there’s a having-it-both-ways insistence that a culture that could create violence is inherently sick and deranged, while playing out a wildly overstated version of sick derangement in a manner designed to be maximally tense and amusing."
438,Squid Game,69,7.1,"To be clear, there is an obvious difference between spectatorship of real-world and fictional violence, even before Hwang’s script dramatically draws it out. But it might be easier to see that distinction if the pile of bodies had been slaughtered in service of an idea more interesting than that inequality is bad. A season-closing conversation between the game’s winner and its architect indicates that the game was, in its essence, designed for entertainment and to see if it is possible for people to be good. (He believes that they are not, despite having seen various of the participants exhibiting teamwork, selflessness, and cooperation — but then, he was personally betrayed by the game’s winner, so his feelings may be a bit raw.)"
439,Squid Game,69,7.1,"This feels painfully thin as a justification for 455 dead bodies. Which is maybe the point: Those who play the Squid Game are subject to the most banal and juvenile philosophizing of those who, because of lucky breaks in life, get to determine everyone else’s reality. But taken on literal terms, that the show burned through so much life and so much fake blood in order to stage a character-based investigation of goodness, then it really is no surprise that this show has taken off. In relishing fictional death, the viewer of this series is told he’s doing something virtuous. And in enjoying gruesomeness while also tut-tutting at a system that would create such gruesomeness and rooting for its takedown, that viewer is experiencing a double pleasure, a sense of enjoying a show while also perching above it that ends up being the most complicated thing about “Squid Game.”"

471,Hellbound,66,5.4,"H

Hellbound
starts with a smoke monster dragging people to hell, then ups the ante. Over the course of the new Netflix drama, creators Choi Gyu-seok and Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho push through plot lines and human body parts with the same devil-may-care attitude of the opening, balancing social commentary with the ever-mounting tension that comes with a world where you might be brutally sent to hell at the drop of a hat. Miraculously, Hellbound manages to pull it all off for the whole six-episode season."
472,Hellbound,66,5.4,"The stakes are set by episode 1: As the clock strikes 1:20 p.m., an otherwise unassuming man fearfully is ruthlessly torn apart by demonic, ape-like monsters who leave only charred remains in their wake. From there, Hellbound moves methodically to interrogate the moment. Detective Jin Kyung-hoon (Yang Ik-june) is assigned to investigate the “murder,” as well as the New Truth, a YouTube-based religious sect claiming that the creatures are in fact angels acting on the divine will of God. In the eyes of New Truth chairman Jung Jin-soo (Burning’s Yoo Ah-in), these sinners got what was coming to them, and the rest of the world would be wise to wake up to God’s new strategy."
473,Hellbound,66,5.4,"Neither the chairman, nor the detective, nor even Min Hyejin (Kim Hyun-joo), a lawyer for the accused sinners, holds the show’s focus for long. Rather, Hellbound morphs from police procedural to social media outrage thinkpiece to religious soliloquy to Greek tragedy, narrowing the lens with each jump in order to tighten the screws of what living with such merciless judgment really means. That could leave the show feeling unfocused, but instead it just feels like intentional chaos, eschewing anything that would let the story be too neat. In the same vein as Akira, the narrative simply jumps between characters as they’re responding to the central events, providing whatever is the most interesting lens on the story at the time."
474,Hellbound,66,5.4,"From the perspective of a sinner condemned for their sex life, Choi and Yeon expose how it’s all too easy to run afoul of hysterical puritanism (a plotline Hellbound wisely sets without a whiff of “cancel culture” discourse). As the New Truth and their extremist counterpart the Arrowhead raise the profile of those who have received “the decree” — and subsequently dox the “sinner” and their family — the show interrogates how public perception changes the stakes of judgment. But it’s the initial pairing of religious leader and police officer that’s most interesting across the first season. Both believe in a higher power, be it God or the state, and perhaps overvalue the autonomy an average person has within those systems. They both desire an acceptable justice for transgressing, they just disagree on who should dole out that punishment. In the end, their opposition is the result of both of them watching the establishment as they know it collapse on top of them. And they’re both just as helpless in the face of otherworldly ape monsters as the rest of us."
475,Hellbound,66,5.4,"None of the other characters are quite as captivating as the pairing of detective and demagogue. If Hellbound has any major blindspots it’s the running problem that the powers behind the New Truth and the larger concept of belief — particularly fervent, violent belief — aren’t worth interrogating, or at least aren’t complex enough for a show devoted to highlighting the layers of “bad” decisions seems glaring across the six-episode season. A faceless mob eager to do violence in the name of the Lord is just comes off as pure evil."
476,Hellbound,66,5.4,"But a taut narrative is able to pull its viewers along even through those difficulties. The world of Hellbound, marked as it is by Old Testament judgment, provides just enough subjective perspective a puzzle that doesn’t quite fit together, until it does. The gray industrial locales and moody atmosphere create an almost noir Seoul, encouraging scrutiny of the narratives being presented. Indeed, it’s no accident that Yeon and Choi frame every pang of danger like a monster movie. The attacks feel animalistic and brutal, much more tangibly violent than, say, Sam Raimi’s brand of playful gore. The choices add up to a tone that never allows the audience to feel at peace with their place in the narrative, no matter what the New Truth says. Yoo Ah-in is particularly inspired casting, letting his chairman be just as virtuous as he is shifty, immovable in his low-key fanaticism. It’s on his shoulders that the rest of the players can build their respective roles — the damaged cop, the dogged attorney, the questioning parents — without ever feeling simply drawn."
477,Hellbound,66,5.4,"That’s Hellbound’s greatest trick of all. In adapting seven installments of his own Webtoon comic, Choi is able to build a dynamic world, constantly and cleverly laying out the groundwork for the next step, and in the execution, Yen never lets up. The series takes swipes at for-profit religion, a public’s appetite for violence and redemption, and how crimes are often just the tip of the societal iceberg, always finding a new corner of the world to land its hits. By the end of season 1, Hellbound’s many focused narratives fuse into a startling new reality, once again overriding the rules the world seems to be functioning by. There can (and probably will) be more mystery to this story in future seasons, and I’ll be devouring them with all the intensity of a supernatural smoke ape."
478,Hellbound,66,5.4,Hellbound season 1 will be released on Netflix on Nov. 19.

530,Hellbound,66,5.4,"Netflix continues to pump out Korean shows that are a lot different from the romantic comedies that they license from other producers. Squid Game, of course, proved to be a worldwide megahit, and it’s about as grim a show as we’ve seen. So how about a show where dark figures come out of nowhere to send people to hell? Read on for more."
531,Hellbound,66,5.4,Opening Shot: Seoul on a typical day. “The day was just an ordinary day.” We then see a cafe.
532,Hellbound,66,5.4,"The Gist: While a bunch of students see a YouTube video by Jeong Jin-soo (Yoo Ah-in), the supposed leader of the New Truth Society, and footage of mysterious dark figures beating a person to death, a man sits at a table staring at the clock on his phone. As the clock hits 1:20 PM on November 10, a rumble goes through the city."
533,Hellbound,66,5.4,"The massive dark figures in the video appear out of nowhere, and make their way towards the man, bashing people and things in their way. As he runs through the streets, the dark giants push and smash cars in order to get him. When they catch up to him, they beat him senseless before burning him into an unrecognizable husk."
534,Hellbound,66,5.4,"A clearly distracted Jin Kyeong-hoon (Yang Ik-june), a police detective whose wife was murdered a few months prior, is late to the briefing about the case. His annoyed chief assigns him and fellow detective Hong Eun-pyo (Park Jung-pyo) to investigate the New Truth Society, as they have been spreading the word about these incidents."
535,Hellbound,66,5.4,"They go to the scene and see a New Truth gathering, with “Chairman Jeong” explaining what happens: People who are convicted criminals see a ghostly presence that tells them what day and time they’re going to be sent to hell, and then the dark giants come at that prescribed time. They talk to Jeong about how he came to this prophecy; he first saw these creatures on a pilgrimage to Tibet, and it gave him a purpose in life, to find God and live righteously. Kyeong-hoon is already angry, having seen his daughter Hee-jeong (Lee Re) at the rally."
536,Hellbound,66,5.4,"As he researches the case, he sees that an attorney named Min Hye-jin (Kim Hyun-joo) has investigated victims of the New Truth, and that there’s a connection between New Truth and a more extreme cult called The Arrowhead."
537,Hellbound,66,5.4,"We cut to a scene where a mom named Park Jeong-ja (Kim Shin-rok) is being given a birthday cake by her kids; then all of a sudden a golden hologram of a mask shows up and says that she will go to hell in five days, at 3:00 PM."
538,Hellbound,66,5.4,"Meanwhile, a man in neon makeup and a goat skull mask, representing The Arrowhead, goes online and talks about God’s judgement. He also broadcasts the name of the victim and wonders what he did to be damned as he was. He also shows video of teens beating up a sociology professor, Gong Hyeong-joon (Im Hyeong-guk), for giving an interview expressing doubt about this being due to God. Kyeong-hoon questions the professor, represented by Hye-jin, and Eun-pyo questions the teens, who are adamant that the world is about to change. For her part, Hye-jin thinks this is just the beginning of the violence by followers of The Arrowhead."
539,Hellbound,66,5.4,"Then Park Jeong-ja shows up at Hye-jin’s office, after approaching Chairman Jeong about the incident. She tells Hye-jin about Jeong’s unusual request for the day she goes to hell."
540,Hellbound,66,5.4,"What Shows Will It Remind You Of? Though there’s some more supernatural elements, Hellbound has a lot of elements about other shows where cops chase down cult leaders, like The Following."
541,Hellbound,66,5.4,"Our Take: Hellbound, written by Choi Kyu-sok based on a webtoon of the same name, moves a bit slowly at first. Its trying to tie the threads of its story together, from these unusual, seemingly supernatural murders to Jeong and the New Truth, to the Arrowhead, and to how Kyeong-hoon tries to solve this weird crime while still in mourning."
542,Hellbound,66,5.4,"It comes off as a bit disjointed, mainly because it’s trying to shoehorn all of its characters into the story. It does a better job than other shows with so many characters (we’re looking at you, The Wheel Of Time!), but it still leaves some holes in the story, like just who the Arrowhead is, why this guy in the goat skull mask is doing videos and what distinguishes them (if there is anything) from The New Truth."
543,Hellbound,66,5.4,"But the killings themselves, and the case Kyeong-hoon is trying to solve, are intriguing enough to keep us watching. What he’s trying to do is figure out if there is an earthly answer to this otherworldly occurrence. Is Jeong full of crap or is there something to his prophecies? As Kyeong-hoon gets deeper into this case, it feels like things will be tied together, though it might take some time to get there."

579,Hellbound,66,5.4,"The wrath of God has been rendered, cinematically speaking, in many shapes and sizes. Sometimes it’s a perfect storm; sometimes it’s Samuel L. Jackson’s Jules striking great vengeance down upon thee with furious anger in “Pulp Fiction.” “Hellbound,” an ambitious new Netflix series from “Train to Busan” director Yeon Sang-ho based on a webtoon (""The Hellbound""), imagines the wrath of God as three smoky gray, towering Hulk-like beasts that appear out of nowhere and proceed to throw slam people into cars, walls, anything really, as if they were chew toys. They splatter a human being's blood everywhere, trashing the environment around them, and then torch said target to a crisp. We later learn that this first (known) victim was given a decree by a floating face in the sky, who told this poor guy exactly when he was going to die and be sent to hell. "
580,Hellbound,66,5.4,"But in one of the show’s many exciting intellectual ideas, this highly bingeable series is not about the terror of the monsters, but what would happen next—how so many people would lose their minds and sense of self, especially if such a literal force of wrath were rationalized as vengeance for our sins. The terror here is people, the opportunists, cult leaders, and blind believers who follow fear to the point of shaming others, hating others, destroying each other for the goal of earning God's mercy. Yeon’s series mixes this grounded horror with thoughtful discussions about how we define a sin, and what we as human beings are deserving of from such a God. "
581,Hellbound,66,5.4,"But before the religious folks project their own meaning onto it, the opening beatdown is investigated like a crime by Jin Kyunghun (Yang Ik-june), who provides our first-person perspective into this phenomenon. He has a sad backstory involving his wife being murdered by someone and then getting out of jail just years later. That becomes a sore spot that is pressed upon by a Jung Jinsu, a stoic chairman of a religious group called the New Truth that believes the monsters are attacking sinners. Yoo Ah-in is excellent in this role that has him delivering cryptic words of faith with a certain deadness in his eyes, making him all the more calming to his rabid supporters, especially as more deadly decrees start to happen. They believe he is right when he says that the attacks are related to someone's great sin. The New Truth has inspired its own QAnon-like media following with a radical group called The Arrowhead, who are riled up broadcast-by-broadcast by a screeching man named Dongwook (Kim Do-yoon). From a gaming chair, he makes grandiose assumptions about why so-and-so received a decree, and shows how the mania of fear can lead to witch hunts. Members of the Arrowhead, usually teenagers with baseball bats, then go out hunting. "
582,Hellbound,66,5.4,"Numerous people get in the crosshairs of Jung Jinsu and the New Truth and the Arrowhead, including a lawyer named Min Hyejin (Kim Hyun-joo), who initially tries to help a doomed woman who receives a decree and decides to let the New Truth broadcast her death. (It's a staggering scene that allows the madness of ""Hellbound"" to grow tenfold.) Min Hyejin has a surprising and heavily rewarding character arc, as many people do in this top-tier ensemble—along with how the series jumps time, it’s never certain where a character will be in the next episode, or if they’ll return. "
583,Hellbound,66,5.4,"It makes more and more sense watching “Hellbound” that it comes from the director of “Train to Busan,” as like that zombie film, he now uses human beings and the rabid effect of fearful belief for potent thrills. And the series’ bursts of action, which can surprise you just like the script's narrative developments, immerse you in the chaos with shaky camera work and long takes. “Hellbound” ensures that while the pummeling monsters stubbornly remain a mystery, the brutality that human beings commit to each other always hurts."
584,Hellbound,66,5.4,"“Hellbound” has an exciting sense of growth across six episodes that shows how the New Truth's ideas take over. But the script can be a little too busy with plotting its conspiracies, and also with its terror, so much that one battle royale at a police station early on is just forgotten about, despite its initial visual promise. There’s also a little too much telling and not showing when it comes to the impact of this new teaching—we hear that half the world has been caught up in New Truth fever, but hardly get a nervous sense of it. Similarly, the show’s dramatic goals can be out of reach, as with an albeit harrowing emotional subplot in the second half involving a baby, that then gets redundant with tearful monologues and sad music. It's the kind of stuff that one hopes is sharpened if there is a season two. "
585,Hellbound,66,5.4,"Co-written with Choi Gyu-seok, “Hellbound” is the kind of horror series that visibly grows with each episode, while it becomes apparent how much the storytellers have considered the scenario at hand in a very grounded sense. They wrestle with the inevitable media frenzy, the shame people would feel after getting a decree, the institutions that would try to capitalize on it, and more. It becomes a fascinating entry into stories about faith, while not having a self-seriousness to its ideas. The wrath monster trio might be absurd, but the madness within ""Hellbound"" is extremely believable. "
586,Hellbound,66,5.4,"All of season one screened for review. ""Hellbound"" is now playing on Netflix."

643,Hellbound,66,5.4,"A man sits in a coffee shop, staring at the clock on his phone, terror rising on his face as his hands tremble. Suddenly, the ground shakes and three massive gray creatures emerge from thin air. They are demons, sent to drag the man to Hell. First, they must perform the demonstration, showing everyone the torturous eternity that awaits this man. They smash him around the shop, down the street, and push his face so hard into a bus window that it breaks. They punch and claw at him, blood splattering everywhere. Finally, they reach into his body, destroying him from within in a burst of fire and light, leaving only a charred skeleton. It’s an effective opening to Netflix’s “Hellbound,” another Korean drama that the streaming giant hopes will latch onto the public like “Squid Game” just did. While there are some very interesting themes explored here, that kind of breakthrough success seems unlikely. After a promising start, “Hellbound” gets a little too repetitive, and the second half isn’t nearly as resonant as the first. However, horror fans might find just enough to save it from TV damnation."

645,Hellbound,66,5.4,"It turns out that the man in the coffee shop, and others around Korea, had been visited by an angel in the form of a giant head that told him the exact time that he would be shuttled off to Hell by the trio of demons who look a little like ashy, ghostly versions of The Thing from the Fantastic Four. Created by “Train to Busan” director Yeon Sang-ho, “Hellbound” is more interested in exploring the reality of this dynamic and what it would to do people than it is providing true scares. (The show is sadly thin on actual tension.) What would it do to mankind to not only confirm that God and Hell are real, but that damnation and vengeance are on the menu? In “Hellbound,” it starts to encourage a form of judgment and vigilantism—if God punishes for sins, shouldn’t we follow in his footsteps? And, of course, religion shifts and forms itself around this new vengeful God with the formation of an organization called The New Truth, led by the mysterious and charismatic Jeong Jin-soo (Yoo Ah-in of “Burning”)."
646,Hellbound,66,5.4,"With a six-episode season that’s very distinctly divided into matching three-episode arcs, the first half centers Jeong and a detective named Jin Kyeong-hoon (an effectively morose Yang Ik-june). Jin knows a thing or two about failed justice because his wife was murdered, and the killer got a short sentence by virtue of being under the influence. He basically went to rehab instead of prison, and is already back on the streets, which torments both Jin and his daughter Hee-jeong (Lee Re), who is drawn to Jeong’s magnetism. There are parts of the first couple of episodes that almost play out like a police procedural as Jin and his team try to figure out exactly what’s going on and maybe even stop the next damnation. It’s kind of “Law & Order: Hell.”"

648,Hellbound,66,5.4,"Both halves of “Hellbound” hinge on unique pending damned souls. In the first, a single mother with two children by different fathers is visited by the angel of damnation. When Jeong learns of her ticking clock, he decides to pay her to livestream the event, showing the power of the demonstration to the world. “Hellbound” is at its most interesting when it’s interrogating these ideas—how would modern society respond to old-fashioned ideas like demons coming to drag people to Hell? Why they’d form cults and start popular Twitch channels designed to track down sinners, of course. As an abrasive influencer in war paint with a skull on his head over a pink wig pushes his followers to determine the damned mother’s sins, Yeong unpacks how easy it is to fall into mob mentalities that forget about the human beings involved when people have a “greater cause” to hide behind."
649,Hellbound,66,5.4,"The first three episodes basically tell an effective standalone story, which means the season reboots in a sense in episode four. A whole new set of characters are introduced as the story jumps forward to find the New Truth and the trio of burly baddies a major part of society. Avoiding spoilers, this half centers around a pending damnation that seems like it should be impossible. Did the angel get it wrong? Are the demons really coming for a pure soul?"
650,Hellbound,66,5.4,"The second half of “Hellbound” has an interesting center but loses a lot of the texture and interesting characters from the first half, making for a notable step down in quality. The tense procedural gives way to a show that’s increasingly repetitive and dialogue-heavy, following people who aren’t nearly as riveting as Jeong or Jin. Yoo Ah-in, also in the Netflix hit “#Alive,” is such a fascinating young actor, one who really gets what “Hellbound” should be about, that the show suffers when he leaves it."
651,Hellbound,66,5.4,"Even as “Hellbound” struggles in its second act, one has to admire Yeon Sang-ho’s ambition here, taking his own webtoon and really expanding it into a multi-character, multi-arc story that sometimes almost feels too full of ideas. There have been dozens of stories about sin and damnation, but “Hellbound” feels different, a show that asks viewers what it would do to the world to know that these concepts are more than just religious doctrine. How would it change human behavior? The daring—and slightly underdeveloped—core conceit of “Hellbound” is that knowing the cost of sin wouldn’t make people better, only more judgmental of their sinful neighbors, and even more willing to take vigilante justice into their own hands. That the second half doesn’t pay off the first is a bit disappointing but fans of Yeon’s work and Korean horror (which seems to be everyone lately) should take a look, especially since the final shot hints at a potentially crazy second season.

659,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"This 12-part South Korean Netflix series about zombies invading a high school is gruesome, thrilling, and highly addictive."
660,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,Entertainment Critic
661,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The inherent terror of zombie fiction stems from the fact that once a plague emerges, it spreads at an exponential rate, rendering containment a near-impossibility. In our current pandemic era, that idea has acutely unnerving resonance, and it’s exploited to suspenseful effect by All of Us Are Dead, writer Chun Sung-il and director Lee JQ’s 12-part Netflix series (out now) about an undead outbreak that originates from, and quickly engulfs, South Korea’s Hyosan High School. Primarily taking place inside that confined setting, and yet staged on an enormously monstrous scale, it’s a vigorous marriage of unholy horror and teen drama, the latter of which only complicates its protagonists’ attempts to survive what appears to be the end of the world."
662,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The catalyst for All of Us Are Dead is teen bullying, and in particular the agony inflicted upon Jin-su (Lee Min-goo), which is so bad that his science teacher father Mr. Lee (Kim Byung-chul) attempts to counter it with an experimental drug that will bestow his son with enhanced strength. That plan, alas, goes horribly wrong, begetting a rageful virus that proliferates once an infected mouse in Mr. Lee’s school laboratory bites a young girl, who then gnaws on a nurse, who promptly runs amok in the hallways, chomping on others—thus initiating a cascading wave of pestilence. It’s a catastrophe that expands with swift ferocity and compels a group of kids to hole up in a classroom to figure out what’s suddenly happened, and how they might avoid the same fate as their now-ravenously hungry and roaring fellow students."
663,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"At the head of this makeshift class are Cheong-san (Yoon Chan-young) and On-jo (Park Ji-hoo), lifelong friends who everyone thinks are a couple, in large part because Cheong-san really does have feelings for On-jo. Unfortunately for him, though, On-jo has eyes for hunky Su-hyeok (Park Solomon), a reformed bully who appreciates On-jo’s interest but is actually smitten with aloof class president Nam-ra (Cho Yi-hyun). Theirs is a conventional high school romantic dynamic, and it’s complemented by a range of additional characters and conflicts, including the tension between Cheong-san’s mate Gyeong-su (Ham Sung-min) and snobby Na-yeon (Lee Yoo-mi, of Squid Game), the goofy rapport shared by heavyset Dae-su (Im Jae-hyuk) and loyal Wu-jin (Son Sang-yeon), and the uneasy partnership struck by Wu-jin’s sister Ha-ri (Ha Seung-ri)—an ace archer who’s just failed to qualify for the national team, thus costing her a shot at a college scholarship—and brash Mi-jin (Lee Eun-saem), who meet in a bathroom during the initial chaos."
664,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"All of Us Are Dead fleshes out its story with even more key players, including Cheong-san’s mom (Lee Ji-hyun), who runs a fried chicken restaurant named after her only child, On-jo’s firefighter dad (Jeon Bae-soo), English teacher Ms. Park (Lee Sang-hee), and—most troublesome of all—nasty Gwi-nam (Yoo In-soo), the right-hand henchman to Hyosan High’s chief bully. Gwi-nam, who tormented Jin-su as well as suicidal Eun-ji (Oh Hye-soo), is a tyrannical creep straight out of a Stephen King novel. After being caught perpetrating a heinous crime, he trains his vengeful attention on Cheong-san, culminating with a showdown in a school library on top of unsteady bookshelves that provide a bit of distance between them and the area’s speedy, single-minded zombies. In this sequence, as in numerous others, Lee JQ’s direction is fleet and serpentine, his camera zooming around physical spaces with a velocity that never hampers visual lucidity."
665,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"All of Us Are Dead’s carnage occurs in a variety of typical school locations (teacher’s offices, broadcasting rooms, storage closets, gymnasiums, tennis courts, the cafeteria), where its characters take reasonable, level-headed measures to protect themselves from imminent danger. Rarely does anyone do something head-smackingly stupid during this ordeal, which goes hand-in-hand with the fact that Chun Sung-il and Lee JQ’s series is a self-aware zombie affair, as proven by one student’s early reference to Yeon Sang-ho’s Train to Busan. Later mayhem shot from soldiers’ POVs recalls Call of Duty: World at War: Zombies, while city scenes are reminiscent of Resident Evil, further highlighting the show’s upfront embrace of popular genre fiction, and its desire to have its heroes act, and react, in a manner that’s informed by their knowledge of zombie lore."
666,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Teen romance, jealousy, rivalry, resentment and judgmental meanness all play fundamental roles in All of Us Are Dead, as do concurrent desires for acceptance, compassion and camaraderie. Given the origins of its zombie insanity, the series also functions as a portrait of how ignoring minor violence can lead to mass calamity. More timely still, some characters’ refusal to admit that they’ve been bitten—despite the hazardous ramifications that decision will have for those in their vicinity, once they turn into the undead—captures an all-too-familiar sense of people’s willingness to cling to delusions no matter the risks it poses to others. COVID-19 is only fleetingly mentioned during this 12-hour saga, but its specter looms large over the supernatural action, given how quarantine craziness, ruthless selfishness, and fear of widespread infection courses through its veins."
667,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Part teen soap opera, part sprawling nightmare, All of Us Are Dead benefits from the sheer scope of its bloodbath. Every other scene is marked by dozens—if not more—of raving zombies racing through hallways, across fields and into barricades trying to satiate their hunger, such that its protagonists’ moment-to-moment predicaments frequently feel borderline hopeless. Chun Sung-il and Lee JQ keep the material flowing from one unique locale to the next, all while developing and intertwining their students’ fraught relationships, which mutate in even pricklier ways once a new strain of the virus surfaces—making detection more difficult, and also posing new survival challenges—and the military intervenes in a desperate bid to stop the contagion from consuming the country."
668,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"At a certain point, the proceedings do fall prey to a bit of exhausting repetition, vacillating as they do between teen squabbles and battles against swarms of voracious reanimated corpses who care only about sinking their teeth into necks, arms, and legs. Then again, All of Us Are Dead makes a compelling, and often thrilling, case that a viral apocalypse would ultimately become more than a bit monotonous—something that everyone in the real world can likely relate to right now."
669,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,The vibes were actually good… until the most famous man in the world assaulted a beloved comedian. How do we reconcile that?
670,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,Senior Entertainment Reporter
671,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"T
here was a time when we thought no one would ever care about the Oscars."
672,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Ratings had done a beautiful swan dive into a tropical lake of irrelevance. People complained about how the movies they actually cared about (starts with Spider, ends with Man) weren’t nominated. The Academy and producers had made several decisions that angered longtime viewers of the show, like excising crucial categories because they didn’t have famous people involved. A tear-jerking movie, the plot of which I can’t recount because it makes me weep inconsolably when I do—and yet was somehow dubbed an Oscar “villain”—won many awards."
673,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"But then the most famous man in the world got out of his seat, walked onto the stage, slapped a beloved comedian, and continued to shout at him from his chair."
674,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Again, remember when we thought no one would care about the Oscars?"
675,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"It’s a tragic thing, in multiple ways."
676,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"It doesn’t matter that, for the first time, a streaming service (Apple TV+), won Best Picture at the Academy Awards for CODA, a seismic event in terms of how the industry thinks about how film is consumed. It doesn’t matter that it’s not Netflix that broke the barrier, despite its rich investment in filmmakers, like Jane Campion’s presumed favorite, The Power of the Dog. It doesn’t matter that it was possibly the most targeted and consequential night when it comes to Hollywood addressing—and moreover, representing—LGBT issues."
677,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,It was the biggest night in entertainment in my lifetime. Because of all of that. And also because Will Smith slapped Chris Rock and then won an Oscar.
678,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The question is: Were the Oscars good or bad? After what happened, I don’t know if you could possibly say one way or the other."
679,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"First, there is the explanation that has to be done. Sunday was the Academy Awards. Many people, this writer included, thought they were going to be unwatchable. There were categories moved to pre-shows, presenters hired that made no sense, and all indications that the people involved in producing the biggest night in movies actually did not like movies at all."
680,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"What they forgot, in all of their controversial producing, was that you just can’t produce good TV."
681,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Chris Rock made a horrendous, unforgivable joke about Jada Pinkett Smith and then her husband, now-Academy Award winner Will, slapped him in the goddamn face."
682,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,I guess the Oscars were good?
683,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"I don’t know how famous you have to be that, when a comedian makes a really bad joke (to just define our take: so terribly bad) about your wife, you ignore the many television cameras that are filming the most hallowed night of Hollywood television, interrupt a live broadcast by walking on stage, slap somebody, and then from your seat scream, “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth.”"
684,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"There is, apparently, an exact level of famous you have to be to do that, and that is Will Smith-level famous."
685,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Will Smith did something that the Oscars have reliably tried, but in their insecurity about ratings and buzz, very nearly thwarted itself from doing: creating a moment. It shouldn’t seem like rocket science, but apparently it is: When you put the world’s most beautiful and famous people in a room together and just set up a camera, you capture the weirdest, most beautifully out-of-touch shit."
686,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"That can be a very positive thing. I don’t love that Jessica Chastain tied her speech back to Tammy Faye Bakker, whose legacy is… complicated. But I am grateful that she devoted so much of her time onstage to talking about the rights of women and LGBT people that are at stake. Only when you are that famous would you presume to have the megaphone for that. (Again, thank God she did!)"
687,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,It can also be a horrible thing.
688,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Let’s be clear: An assault happened. At first, every aunt, college roommate, and person I have ever met asked me if Will Smith getting angry at Chris Rock was a bit. While I’m flattered that anyone thought I had inside information, I can say definitively, at this point, it was not."
689,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,We’re so programmed to being programmed that none of us knew how to deal with it.
690,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"In that moment and in his speech, Will Smith revealed himself to be a very famous person rendered very human. I do not condone his assault, but I understand the ethos. (Imagine any of these words ever being used in relation to the Academy Awards before.)"
691,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"But again, I am trying to imagine just how famous and privileged you must be to—at the goddamn Academy Awards!—get out of your seat, slap someone, sit back down and heckle, and then win the Oscar."
692,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,It’s not that it’s great TV. It’s the kind of TV we still don’t know how to process.
693,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"As mentioned before, there were substantial changes made to tonight’s ceremony in order to make it a show that anyone would care about, prior to the Will Smith of it all. The giant, taunting question was: How do you make people care about the Oscars who don’t care about the Oscars? You would think that’s a question a child would laugh at for being unanswerable. But the Academy braved it. They tried. Their response: Find Tony Hawk."
694,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"God bless the producers for making the unnecessary presenter moment of Hawk, Kelly Slater, and Shaun White as bad as pundits predicted it would be. And also, drag the producers for the concept. Of all humans, Hollywood or otherwise in the world, these were the three brought on to introduce a tribute to James Bond."
695,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The ridiculous thing is that, besides all of that drama, the show was actually… going well? Amy Schumer’s opening monologue killed. It also had the Ricky Gervais-esque, Hollywood-skewering energy that people didn’t expect. (Who knew she’d go so hard on Being the Ricardos?) And Regina Hall proved why Regina Hall should be everywhere, in everything, in everyone’s mind."
696,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"There was so much desperation that, on any Will Smith Didn’t Slap Chris Rock night, we’d be talking about it."
697,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,There’s been so much talk about how the Academy is chasing viewers who wouldn’t ordinarily tune into the show. I guess the mythological person they’ve been after is someone very excited to see Beyoncé dressed as a tennis ball? That’s what opened the show. (And Bey didn’t even win! I still don’t understand the politics/legality of inviting Beyoncé to an awards show and then not giving it to her.)
698,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"In any case, was this year’s Oscars good? I’m better at the other question. Was it bad? No, absolutely not. That I’m so obsessed with the awards and can’t answer either way? Well, that: That’s a slap in the face."
699,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,“Keep my wife’s name out of your F*CKING mouth!” Smith shouted at the comedian in what definitely did not seem like a bit.
700,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,Senior Writer
701,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Shortly before he was poised to win his first Academy Award for King Richard, Will Smith made the Oscars theater incredibly uncomfortable—and confused the hell out of the viewers at home—when he appeared to confront presenter Chris Rock on stage for making a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s lack of hair."
702,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"“Jada, I love you,” Rock said, before joking, “G.I. Jane 2, can’t wait to see it!”"
703,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"He seemed genuinely surprised when Smith stormed the stage and slapped him in the face. Their extended exchange was bleeped by ABC but it was fairly easy to read Smith’s lips when he shouted, “Keep my wife’s name out of your FUCKING mouth!”"
704,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"In an uncensored version posted to Twitter, Rock said, “Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.”"
705,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"“Wow, dude, it was a G.I. Jane joke,” the comic added before Smith repeated his deadly serious plea: “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth!”"
706,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"“I’m going to,” a visibly unnerved Rock said, shaking his head. He seemed like he wanted to say something back, but ultimately decided to move on and announce the nominees for Best Documentary."
707,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Last December, Pinkett Smith opened up about her struggles with alopecia, revealing that she had decided to shave her head instead of constantly dealing with hair-loss issues. “Mama’s gonna have to take it down to the scalp so nobody thinks she got brain surgery or something,” she posted on Instagram at the time. “Me and this alopecia are going to be friends … period!”"
708,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"When Sean “Diddy” Combs presented next, he urged Smith and Rock to “solve this like family” at the after party."
709,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,Yarnell Sampson said the ICON Park drop ride should have stopped once his 14-year-old son began to panic as a heartbreaking 911 call was released.
710,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,Breaking News Reporter
711,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The Missouri father of the 14-year-old boy who died while on an amusement park ride in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday said his son knew he was in danger—and he wants to make sure no other child feels like that again."
712,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"“He was panicking when he was going up,” Yarnell Sampson, the dad of Tyre Sampson, told WOFL. “He was explaining to his friend next to him, ‘I don’t know man. If I don’t make it down, please tell my Mom and Daddy I love them.’ For him to say something like that, he must have felt something.”"
713,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Sampson’s description of his son’s fear matches what a woman told a 911 operator just after the tragic fall. In a 911 call obtained by the Daily Mail, a woman claimed Tyre had not been secured in his seat prior to the slip."
714,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"“They didn’t secure the seatbelt on him,” she said. He was also breathing just after the fall, she said, but because he had fallen on his stomach, no one could perform CPR. His arms and legs appeared to be broken, she said."
715,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The Orange County Sheriff’s Office is investigating Tyre Sampson’s death after he fell from the 430-foot drop tower Thursday. Sampson retained Ben Crump, famous for his civil rights and personal injury claims, who said a fun time at a park “should not have ended in tragedy.”"
716,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Sampson said the ride was the only one who offered to take his 6-foot-5-inch, 340-pound son, something he found suspicious."
717,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"""This one particular ride said, ‘We can take you, come on! Get on!’” he said. “No one else allowed him to get on the ride, so I’m wondering what happened between now and then that made them say, ‘Come on, get this ride!’”"
718,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Sampson described his son as a star football player and honor roll student. Tyre, a St. Louis native, was in town with friends through his football program and had just come off a stellar season. He said his son had the NFL in sights for his future."
719,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"“He was a team player. He was the type of young man that’d take the shirt off his back and give it to you,” Sampson said."
720,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,Now he wants answers as to why that young team player with a bright future was killed.
721,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"“This should never happen to anyone else’s child ever again,” Sampson said. “If I have anything to do with this, it will not happen ever again.”"
722,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Mean girls and bullies, rich kids and poor. Unrequited passion, social anxiety. It’s all pretty standard high school stuff. But the stakes get just a little higher when a massive zombie outbreak hits."
723,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"“All of Us Are Dead” is the latest South Korean thriller from Netflix, a fast, gory attempt to capture the success of the runaway hit “Squid Game.” This time the menace is a runaway virus, the symptoms of which — violent twitching, acrobatic bending, a ravenous appetite for human flesh — should ring familiar to anyone who has seen enough zombie movies and TV shows. Very early on, one of the characters name-checks “Train to Busan,” the popular 2016 action flick about zombies aboard a high-speed South Korean train. “All of Us Are Dead” is nothing if not self-aware. It’s also quite well executed, even when it feels more like an exercise than an organic creation."
724,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"It all starts with a cute little hamster. The school’s science teacher, whose son has been mercilessly bullied, starts experimenting on the rodent. The next thing you know, he has created a fear virus — shades of Danny Boyle’s “28 Days Later.” One student bites another, who attacks another. The fun spreads to teachers, medics and cops. Until there’s nowhere to turn. The outbreak has breached the walls of the school. All of them are dead, or at least walking dead."
725,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"“All of Us Are Dead” trades in some of the class warfare that made “Squid Game” tick. The rich kids, petulant and selfish, look down on the “welfies,” or welfare kids, and deem them more expendable than the other students. Most of the conflicts brought to the surface by the zombie apocalypse are typical high school stuff writ large. Cyberbullying plays a big part, as do helicopter parenting and broken hearts. The zombies have a way of both accentuating the drama and flattening out the playing field. After all, once you become a twitching, sprinting monster with blood gushing from your mouth, no one cares how popular you were."
726,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The directors, Lee Jae-Kuo and Kim Nam-soo, keep the suspense taut, leaving us to wonder what lurks around the corner and daring to zombify characters we’ve come to care for. “All of Us Are Dead” works on a micro level, driving home the dramas of specific students; and on a mass scale, with long shots that reveal the chaos brought by dozens of zombies thrashing and snarling. As students hunker down in classrooms, hiding under desks, trying to remain quiet, it’s hard not to think of the school shooting epidemic that haunts American shores. And then there’s the shadow of COVID-19. It seems a zombie outbreak makes for a handy and versatile metaphor."
727,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The filmmakers keep the action and the showdowns coming, to the extent that “All of Us Are Dead” can become rote. One mini-drama fades into another. One dash for life down a hallway becomes indistinguishable from the next. It can get exhausting over the course of 12 episodes."
728,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"This series is actually a good argument for a staggered weekly release, although it should always be added, you don’t have to watch it all at once. Just because the zombies are starving doesn’t mean you can’t show a little restraint."
729,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"M

787,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"In All Of Us Are Dead (Netflix), it’s fight or flight for a group of students when their high school becomes ground zero for a zombie outbreak. The series is adapted from Now At Our School, a Korean online digital comic that ran from 2009-11, and it features at least one cast member from Netflix’s runaway hit Squid Game in Lee Yoo-mi (Player #240), who is one of the set-upon students here. "
788,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Opening Shot: In a swirling long take, we see two male students taunting and bullying a third boy as two more students look on. Pushes become shoves and kicks to the chest, and the violence escalates until the victim is thrown from the roof on which all of this is occurring. He crashes to the alley three stories below."
789,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The Gist: Right before he flew off that roof, bullied student Jin-su seemed to fight back against his tormentors with a mixture of rabid determination and bone-snapping urgency, and when we meet him again in the emergency room, it’s clear that bullies and bruises are the least of this kid’s problems. He’s got zombie fever, and his father Lee Byung-chan (Kim Byung-chul) knows it. Lee attempts to beat his son to death with a Bible, and soon returns to Hyosan High School, where he’s the science teacher. For the moment, all is calm at Hyosan, where students Cheong-san (Yoon Chan-young), On-jo (Park Ji-hoo), and Su-Hyeok (Park Solomon) are attempting to navigate a love triangle: Cheon-san pines for On-jo, but he’s stuck in the friend zone, while On-jo is crushing on Su-Hyeok, who seems to have eyes for someone else. Class bully Yoon Gwi-nam (Yoo In-soo), meanwhile, pesters the shy and the weak."
790,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Mr. Lee is hiding more than his outcast, zombie-sick son. A hamster in his lab is infected, too, and bites a mean girl named Hyeon-ju. Lee restrains her in his office and injects her with benzodiazepine. “It’s slowing down the infection,” he tells a video log, “but only by a few hours at most.” Whatever the motives of Hyosan’s most deranged science teacher, his attempts to study the zombie virus quickly spin wildly out of control, and it’s bedlam as the bitten transform into bloodthirsty undead freaks."
791,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Who will survive the onslaught? In the first episode of All Of Us Are Dead, none of the students we’ve met are immediately among the bitten. But the zombies on this show move fast, have strength, and have already been shown to be pretty resilient. (Remember the kid who survived being thrown from a roof?) Cheong-san and On-jo better stick together, watch their backs, and maybe make a beeline for the high school archery range."
792,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,
793,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"What Shows Will It Remind You Of? Obviously, zombies are everywhere, with the unkillable The Walking Dead having spawned a host of spinoffs. But Netflix also features the Korean period zombie drama Kingdom, plus five seasons of Z-Nation, its own spin-off Black Summer, and the Brazilian zombie series Reality Z."
794,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Our Take: In Korean pop culture, zombies have legs. From the 2016 hit Train to Busan (a film so popular, it’s directly referenced by the characters in AOUAD) to 2020’s #Alive, “K-Zombie” movies and dramas are all the rage in the country, where they often serve as a critique on issues of class, consumption, and competition in contemporary society. In All Of Us Are Dead, Hyosan High School is already serving as a microcosm of the country at large, with its class structures and hierarchies well in place. Rich kids like Lee Yoo-mi’s Na-yeon look down on their classmates, the class bullies pick on the weaker kids relentlessly, and gossip runs rampant in the halls. As those same places become full of zombies running amok, it will be interesting to see how the hierarchical structures mutate. As Mr. Lee says during a science lesson, “an organism doesn’t depend on its metabolism, but its will to survive.” The zombie virus he helped unleash will definitely get to the bottom of whether that’s true, and who it’s true for."
795,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"As for gore and zombifying special effects, All Of Us Are Dead in the early going features the typical gouts of blood and torn flesh and a few tremendous and startling moments of undead bodies flinging themselves forcefully into walls, off roofs, or crashing through schoolroom windows in slow-motion. As the school grounds become a warzone, there’s bound to be more opportunities for the death blows and kill shots that are standard issue for zombie content. But given the entrenched tribalism of the students, it’ll also be satisfying to see who among the living is targeted. There’s no question that the school bullies who manage to avoid being bitten will need to be taken down a peg by their fellow surviving classmates. Even as the zombies swarm, All Of Us Are Dead is sure to have its Battle Royale or Lord of the Flies moments."
796,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,Sex and Skin: None.
797,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Parting Shot: As the recently turned chase a throng of screaming students into the dining hall, Cheong-san and On-jo get their first terrifying glimpse of this horrible new reality. Suddenly, a zombie scrambles over the trampled bodies to confront On-jo head on, blood dripping from its shredded face."
798,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Sleeper Star: Park Solomon is terrific as the handsome, self-assured Su-Hyeok, who’s put his past as a bully behind him in favor of trying to be a better person and classmate."
799,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Most Pilot-y Line: It’s all Cheong-san can do to not admit his lifelong crush on On-jo. “If the world comes to an end,” he tells Su-Hyeok, “and only On-jo, me, and a zombie are left, I’d go out with the zombie.” Little does he know how soon his statement will be tested."
800,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Our Call: STREAM IT. Beyond the visceral thrill of watching zombies chow down on their unfortunate victims, All Of Us Are Dead puts social hierarchies and human beings’ mechanisms for survival under a microscope."

834,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,Yang Hae-sung/Netflix
835,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"There are few on-screen situations more dread-inducing than watching a zombie outbreak in real time. Tracking a single infection as it grows exponentially and tears through an unwitting populace is an anxiety-riddled experience that’s rarely easy to watch. “All of Us are Dead,” the latest Netflix drama to take a stab at a widespread cataclysmic event, announces itself in its opening episode by meticulously showing the transformation of a school. In a single afternoon, the massive Hyosan High School complex is plunged into chaos after one errant bite from a science lab test animal starts an irreversible chain reaction."
836,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The scope of that explosion in zombie numbers is the primary achievement of “All of Us Are Dead.” Director Lee JQ does an effective job at setting up the geography of the school, swooping through hallways and around rooms spanning the various floors. The sheer number of students in any given rehearsal room, cafeteria, or lobby — all succumbing to a mind-numbing plague in mere seconds — makes the opening moments of the series as terrifying as any potential viewer’s expectations."
837,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,
838,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,
839,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Though, as the Hyosan population gets winnowed down in record time, “expectations” is the key word hanging over much of what’s left of the 12-episode season. Despite the elaborate setup and execution of a disintegrating society, “All of Us are Dead” picks up that opening and follows a pretty established zombie story playbook. It’s delivered in an oddly-paced season that fights against an intuitive structure as much as these students try to beat back chomps from throngs of kids in uniforms."
840,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The makeup of the small group fighting the undead changes over the course of the series, but it’s built around childhood friends Cheong-san (Yoon Chan-young) and On-jo (Park Ji-hoo). They’re in high school, so naturally a throng of mutants trying to rip at their flesh is only slightly more at the forefront of their minds than the crushes they’ve been nursing on their fellow survivors. Barely keeping their feelings and their previous social standings at bay, they go through the standard trial-and-error process of figuring out how to create distractions, alert outside rescue forces, and weigh the merits of hunkering down vs. escaping."
841,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,“All of Us are Dead”
842,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,Yang Hae-sung/Netflix
843,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Given that the zombies of “All of Us are Dead” are the relentless, feed-at-all-cost variety, it leaves the students with few options. Much like Dae-su (Im Jae-hyuk) and Su-hyeok (Lomon) and Nam-ra (Cho Yi-hyun) are trapped in a cycle of darting from room to room when their makeshift barriers give way, “All of Us are Dead” has a wheel-spinning feel to it. What begins as a real-time tracker of a crisis becomes a jumble of thematic hammer-blows, unnecessary flashbacks, and conversations that stick to familiar ground. Each new time the series cuts to archival video of the virus’ architect rattling off vague platitudes about human nature, it underlines the idea that the show has few concrete ideas beyond executing a specific subgenre of story in a particular location."
844,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,
845,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,
846,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"There’s no better example of “All of Us are Dead’s” stagnation than Gwi-nam (Yoo In-soo), one of the more maddening bullies ever put on screen, and only partly by design. In a sea of zombies bent on their destruction, no single figure presents more of a frustration for the group of survivors than this cold-hearted antagonist driven solely by revenge. Gwi-nam is the requisite “are humans the real monster?” addition to the story, but aside from showing the brutality of one high school villain writ large, “All of Us are Dead” treats him like so many other elements of this story: a way to add more manufactured drama on top of what’s already a life-or-death situation."
847,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"It points to the idea that, even after fashioning this giant, high school-sized canvas to work with, “All of Us are Dead” is really only using a few of the storytelling tools at its disposal. The group of survivors hop from room to room in a series of elaborate escape plans. Yet, the creativity of these patchwork life-saving inventions is never really reflected in the students themselves. Saddling them with simple, unrequited feelings and tiny, surface-level distinctions, “All of Us are Dead” doesn’t have nearly as much to offer about these kids, given the extensive time the show spends with them. Torn between showing them trying to figure out how these zombies are functioning, how to take care of daily necessities, and how to deal with potential dangers inside their own group, there’s a lot in this show that functions simply to move this group between narrative checkpoints."
848,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"It would be one thing if “All of Us are Dead” was really trying to dial into the monotony of outlasting a hoard of brainless former classmates lurking around every corner. When the show’s attention shifts away from that main group, though, it always seems like a more effective use of time. A splinter group of Hyosan survivors, mainly made up of the lasting members of the archery team (cross “bow-and-arrow weapons” off the zombie story checklist!) has a more distinct spread of personalities and ambitions. One cold open tells more in a few minutes about a single solider than we learn about most of the Hyosan crew. By the time the show zooms out to bigger administrative forces beyond the principal and English teacher, there’s almost a tacit acknowledgment that the students were never going to be enough to sustain an entire show on their own."

851,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Still, for as repetitive as “All of Us are Dead” becomes, it’s at least built on an effective foundation. The stunt work and sheer amount of logistical choreography needed to make this a believable hellscape is impressive. Though some of the inconsistencies in zombie behavior sometimes feel a little lazy from a story perspective, the overall balance between hivemind movement and randomness makes every peek out the window at the school’s swarmed front lawn both sad and eerie. The contortion of crunched limbs and mouthfuls of hunks of flesh (this has to be a contender for the series with the most closed captioning uses of the word “squelching”) makes this a physical, visceral experience, even when the show’s plot seems content to idle."

854,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The story at the outbreak’s epicenter takes up the most energy of “All of Us are Dead,” which doesn’t leave much room for the eventual glimpses into how those adults in charge are responding. Whenever the attention turns away from the high school, it reinforces the idea that scale is what this show does best. As it becomes clearer that the students are far from the only ones having to deal with this overwhelming problem, it’s hard not to imagine what a version of this show would look like if it weren’t so tethered to a single location."
855,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"There are faint glimmers of a leaner, more confident show that peek through. At one point, the Hyosan students record goodbye messages for their families, a reminder that the kids whose parents don’t get their own separate storylines have something to live for, too. There’s not much room for non-gloominess here, yet the occasional light-hearted distraction and banter makes for something other than the living hell unfolding just beyond the walls of each occupied room. These moments are welcome when they pop up. For a show with nearly a 12-hour running time, though, there aren’t nearly enough to break a familiar story’s repetitive cycle."

873,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"SPOILER ALERT: This review includes some spoilers for Netflix’s “All of Us Are Dead,” which premiered Friday, January 28."
874,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"As the last, desperate teen survivors in “All of Us Are Dead” do their best to stay alive through a zombie apocalypse, hoping beyond hope that adults are coming to rescue them, it takes a full day of horrors to make them realize that they’re on their own. With their high school labeled Ground Zero for the escalating outbreak, the students are left for dead (or, as is the case with zombies, something in between). Their ensuing all-out battle for survival makes up the meat of “All of Us Are Dead,” Netflix’s elaborate new adaptation of the popular webtoon, in ways both banal and epic. With the high school survivors stuck inside their school for most of the season, writer Chun Sun-il and director Lee JQ have to keep finding inventive ways to make each classroom and confrontation a terrible new challenge — and they do. Like “Squid Game” before it — the only comparison I’ll be making between this show and Netflix’s recent smash Korean hit, I promise — “All of Us Are Dead,” makes the most out of its nightmarish central location to otherworldly, dizzying effect."

877,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"With 12 episodes running at least an hour each, “All of Us Are Dead” splits its time between the nightmare unfolding at the school and the one engulfing the world beyond. At Ground Zero, best friends On-jo (Park Ji-hu) and Cheong-san (Yoon Chan-young) make it out of the initial crush of zombie mayhem to a classroom where others like the class president Nam-ra (Cho Yi-Hyun), mean girl Na-yeon (Lee Yoo-mi), and On-jo’s crush Su-hyeok (Lomon) are sheltering. Elsewhere, star archer Ha-ri (Ha Seung-ri) and blunt nicotine addict Mi-jin (Lee Eun-saem) hunker down in a bathroom, while unrepentant bully Gwi-nam (Yoo In-soo) makes sure he’ll end up on top, no matter the cost. To say the least: it’s a sprawling cast, and with the addition of several adult factions outside the campus struggling to keep the outbreak under control, episodes are dense and run longer than necessary. But the school plotlines really work, in large part thanks to continued ingenuity with the props and sets and the charismatic young cast, with Yoon Chan-young and Cho Yi-Hyun as notable standouts."
878,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"The show’s weakness, then, lies beyond the labyrinthine school itself as it tries to view the outbreak from the outside in. Watching yet another military take on zombies, no matter how bone-crunchingly sickening the ones in “All of Us Are Dead” are, just isn’t that interesting after seeing so many other TV shows and movies do the same. If the drama is to continue beyond this season, digging in to the “why” and “how” of this reality having zombies in it is probably advisable. But few scenes involving the adult characters are especially compelling or different from what we’ve seen before in the zombie genre, whether they be a helpless assembly member (Bae Hae-sun), a detective (Lee Kyu-hyung), or even the miserable scientist (Kim Byung-chul) who accidentally started it all."

881,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"What this particular zombie series can instead offer unlike any other is that core group of teens running into danger, mourning constant deaths, figuring out how the virus is evolving, and forcing their way to safety through the familiar halls of their school with one ingenious scheme after another. Sequences like Cheong-san and Gwi-nam facing off on top of the library stacks, a tense tip-toeing mission down a hallway, and a mad dash across the auditorium to safety are impressively staged to bring the extraordinary and the ordinary together to thrilling effect. And when the teens do get a moment to breathe in between all the gory panic, the show lets them still be teens. They continue to nurse crushes and grudges, still crave acceptance and intimacy, still find darkness and hope in the least likely places."
882,All of Us Are Dead,67,7.3,"Most of them might be dead. But while some of them are alive, it’s undeniably moving to see them embrace the full experience of being human despite everything trying to stop them from doing exactly that."
