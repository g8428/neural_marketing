God they rip your heart out.\\', \"I think Ali\\'s character was one of the best, a sacrificial lamb character, innocent and pure hearted who gets betrayed in the worst way possible. Also like the immigrant in new country expecting kindness and all dreams to come true, just then to find that things are just as bad as where he has left before. Ali\\'s betrayal scene was heart wrenching and shocking, like the innocent of child destroyed.\", \\'The actor who plays Gi-Hun was so good. i just felt like he was a real person and not an actor playing a character. I look forward to seeing him maybe in Squid Game season 2 and other projects!\\', \\'I’m just hoping the actor that played the man who betrayed Ali isn’t dealing with too much hate. I know there are a LOT of weirdos and delusional people out there who think it’s real and decide to bully the actors relentlessly\\', \\'Just adding as a Korean, the title of the last episode; A Lucky Day is a homage to a famous Korean novel \"A Lucky Day\" by Hyun JinGeon. In the novel the protagonist, a rickshaw driver, happens to get unusually more customers than usual leading him to work until very late. On his way home, he remembers his sick wife\\\\\\'s wish to eat Seollung-tang (bone-marrow soup). Hence, he picks-up a bowl of Seollung-tang only to find his wife had passed away\\', \\'This was such a masterpiece. So glad Korean shows/movies have a platform like Netflix to go mainstream. Korean movies/shows have been underrated for a long time!\\', \\'if you hated the character, then the actor did a great job.\\', \\'This show wasn’t even made in English, yet almost all the comments that I’m seeing are. This is incredible, how many different people from around the world are invested in Squid Game. A show so magnificently written and executed that people of all languages and cultures are deeply appreciating this masterpiece. We absolutely love to see it!!  this show needs the recognition it deserves!!\\', \\'\"Sang-woo thinks he came all the way here because he worked for it and because he\\\\\\'s smart. Gi-un thinks the opposite, that it was the others who helped him cross the bridge. Winners exist because of the losers. Gi-un learned that from experience. But Sang-woo thinks he can only win by turning others into losers. I think the difference in beliefs is what makes this show stand out from other survival game shows.\"\\', \\'I love the fact that this show wasn’t glorifying violence or death like it wasn’t just doing violence for violence but to actually make an impact on you. That was the game itself but it the meaning and insights behind it made it worth your while. It wasn’t just a show where people died it was so much more to do with their characters and their journey surrounding human nature\\', \\'When he said “Mom, I have money now.” I bawled \\', \"I\\'m starting to feel that the cast is more of a family than anything\", \"Awww was hoping the art director would\\'ve talked about the VIP lounge design. It was so lavishingly gaudy with amazing colors.\", \"My wife won\\'t normally watch anything that has subtitles, but she was glued to this show. We binged it in a few days. Everything was first class. The writing, the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the lighting, the sound design, the art direction and production. Everything was just so damn good. I know people complain about the VIPs, but you\\'re supposed to hate them and they made that easy enough. A great show. Curious to see if the writer/director has more story to tell.\", \\'Out of all the actors/actresses I felt sang-woo had the most complex feeling. Like he thrived to win but also it was so mixed. The actor really played him well.\\', \\'The fact that the art director is featured as crucial a piece as the director speaks volumes of what made this show so great. It would not have been nearly as captivating without that set and costume design etc. The art director is brilliant, bravo! \\', \\'Sang-Woo’s portrayal of character is a literal masterpiece. I haven’t seen such master-level portrayal ever\\', \\'\"I thought I should cast people that aren\\\\\\'t that well known\" wish more directors were like this..\\', \\'Insane that they made this for a mere $20m. What they achieved on set is nothing short of breathtaking\\', \\'I’m obsessed with the art director cause this show is mainly alll about the art direction. She’s insane!\\', \\'The show was very philosophical. Lots of hidden messages everywhere. I’m glad the art director had a a pot light because visual artist aren’t recognized too often even though their finished work is always the most recognized.\\', \"I am soooo impressed with Park Hae Soo\\'s acting i checked his other show Prison Playbook, now gonna watch Time To Hunt. He was a theater actor before and it absolutely shows! Like he was the best actor in Squid Game. Also his voice is so cool? Idk and he comes off as very insightful and well-read lol love him so much\", \\'It’s funny how this cute lady is behind making the most dangerous movie\\', \"Park Hae-soo, who played Jo Sang-woo did one hell of a job playing an elitist in this show...there is a point here where the character and actor are split screened and its as if I am looking at two different people...he really looks different, no doubt with help from the production team but wow...the character is someone I wouldn\\'t want to hang around with...the actor is someone I want to buy a beer for...lol.\", \\'I think the most realistic character in squid game are Sangwoo, Ali and Gihun.\\\\n\\\\nSangwoo represent people who is smart but still can fail in life. Ali is that person who is always willing to help and kind but people around him will use that kindness to backstab him just like how people said that in this cruel world we dont need to be too kind coz people will take advantage of us. Lastly, Gihun represent a person who isnt perfect and street smart but despite his imperfection as a human, a son or as a father, he still had humanity in him and you see how his character develops per episode same as the other characters as well.\\', \\'The female art director is a GENIUS & needs more recognition. She brought the whole show to life with unique visual experience.\\', \\'not only did the art and set designs truly make the film, the ACTING was PHENOMENAL. hearing the director say he wanted less-known actors and actresses is mind blowing to me. like these people are amazing and they aren’t well known. HOW are they not well known??\\', \\'The main guy actually looks younger in real life than in the show.\\', \\'THIS is commitment to craft... building a true masterpiece. No egos, no Hollywood-suit-formulas catering to the lowest common denominator. Thank you KOREA!!\\', \\'What a beautiful language. I could listen to Korean like it was music.\\', \\'How adorable is this director? Calling the actress a \"gift from god\" is the sweetest thing oh mai gawd!\\', \"PROPS to the art director, squid game wouldn\\'t have been the same without the iconic visuals\", \\'I basically watched this in one sitting. No show was ever this intense! I was shaken to my core!\\', \\'i would love more interviews like this, this show was a masterpiece\\', \\'\"Our director graduated from SNU.\"\\\\n\\\\nHey why did you steal Jung Jae\\\\\\'s line hahahaha. \\', \"Idk why people hate on sang-woo i mean he\\'s the most realistic character in the show and most people will do what sang-woo did\", \\'As someone who has been watching k-dramas for many years it is great to see them getting the international recognition they deserve. It is also great to be able to see many actors I have already known in different roles. With the exception of Sae Byeok, I have seen pretty much every major character in a different show before so I knew what to expect. The acting was great but the directing/writing and cinematography really put this in a different stratosphere than many k-dramas. Love how the director incorporated aspects of his life into the stories of the two main characters\\', \"I\\'m the absolute biggest fan of the Art Director. She\\'s such a genius.\", \\'“I wanted to test and see if it really worked. I brought some to my hotel the night before and licked alone all night long”  (the director talking of dalgona). Ahhh I love this crew\\', \\'I hope the art director wins an award, her work was pure poetry especially the marbles game set and the when the vips attend .  Truly a great example of balancing several styles very specifically and for incredible effect.\\', \\'Really amazing to hear the art director’s story behind the scenes. What an amazing talent!\\', \"The acting was sooo good it didn\\'t even feel like they were acting. Seemed so real\", \\'the actors are even more handsome when they’re not covered in dirt and blood lol, they look so clean and healthy here\\', \"I love how one of my favourite scenes wasn\\'t scripted: Gi Hun handing her back her fallen coffee. The epicness\", \\'This was a fantastic K-drama. Every actor/actress, director, writers, art designer, and support crew did a fantastic job at the height of their skill set to pull this off. The writing and acting is so much better than a CGI action or gory horror show. This show truly kept me in suspense to the end. A rare feat in today’s entertainment. Job well done! \\', \\'I hope every studio that passed on this over the last 10 years remembers when they had the chance to make this but I’m glad Netflix got it. It’s a great fit for the platform!\\', \\'Art director nailed it …she is just brilliant \\', \\'the director talks so highly of his cast and idk that’s just so sweet\\', \"I\\'m so happy that the show got this much recognition worldwide considering the amount of work they did to make it happen\", \"One of the best TV shows I\\'ve seen in years. I loved this interview and how humble they are with the gold mine they created.\", \\'all the characters were so fascinating, the sets and soundtrack were incredible, the story itself was really interesting. squid game is a masterpiece and im glad it got the mass recognition it deserves\\', \"They picked the perfect actor for Gi-hun, his expressions are so sweet and child-like, he could have been a very unlikeable character, but it was impossible not to sympathize with him. If they\\'d have killed him off it would have been a huge unexpected twist, but I bet people would have been in an uproar.\", \\'An absolute masterpiece of a series. My respect to creators and actors!\\', \\'Sae-byeok may be my favourite character because she is so charming. But actually Sang-woo is the most interesting and realistic character. Coming to think of it, that actor  (Park Hae Soo) did an outstanding job too. Great job to the team and the director, for writing the story, pick the perfect cast, and making it such a phenomenal series.\\', \\'I want to say, the contrast between the games and the stages where they take place is mesmerizing. Everything is so colorful in such a grim situation.\\', \"Jung- jae is so handsome lol I couldn\\'t believe, in the series he is so shabby. But he has an aura and such a deep voice. Whereas Hae- soo is such a smooth talker. All of them are well-mannered and so enthusiastic about the show. The director and creative head can talk all day if given a chance to, so wholesome and articulate.\", \\'Not one part of Squid Game was below excellence, the actors were incredible, the films sets were unbelievable, the music, the writing, everything was incredible.\\', \"The art director absolutely knocked it out of the park.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, the acting, writing, and directing were all incredible. The series was an overall masterpiece. But the visual style was the absolute PERFECT balance between incredibly dark themes and whimsical visuals. It tricked your brain in a very odd way into thinking you were watching something cheery and lighthearted, only to be hit with something macabre and evil.\", \"I\\'ve been hooked on Korean movies since Train to Busan in 2016. So happy to see more Korean media go mainstream. There is so much art and talent over there.\", \\'This man is such a fucking genius and the art director is truly just absolutely insane for how brilliant she is. I want them to sweep awards, this show and the writing was so fucking heavy and so real with its example of capitalism and how money can change everything and absolutely nothing. truly just brilliant all around. So fucking happy he never gave up in believing in this piece of work. We are all the better for it being out in the world!\\', \"I may get teary-eyed when watching a movie or a show, but I never got to the point of crying. Ji-Young\\'s death was the first time any form of media made me cry. Even them glossing over this scene here brought back memories. I still think about it daily\", \"I\\'m just DYING to see Season 2. That\\'s it. Carry on\", \\'When he said they were playing tug of war against a forklift I couldn’t help but laugh, no wonder they were worn out \\', \"The that the girl was laughing when she wasn\\'t meant to was so funny, especially since Gi-Hun gave her back the coffee when he wasn\\'t mean to.\", \\'The art director should win an emmy seriously.\\', \"The acting, and the storyline are definitely world class, but I don\\'t think people gave enough appreciation to the artistic aspect of the show. The set they designed for this series, each of them are individual pieces of art. The attention to detail is mind blowing.\", \\'korean movies and tv shows are on another level. such high quality stuff being made there that genuinely rules. obviously there is probably a lot of shit made there like anywhere, but the stuff ive seen has been great\\', \\'I thought that Sangwoo was such a fascinating character after I finished the show\\', \"I went in thinking that this show was probably overhyped, and I was completely wrong. I was glued to my seat while watching, and I\\'m already hoping they make a second season.\", \\'It was an amazing movie; the visuals,  acting, was so well did!\\', \\'It is amazing how korean actors (and kpop) can change aparance. I didnt see that in Europe. USA etc. Their acting is so emotional, they look so diffrently than here - amazing!\\', \\'Okay but like the majority of shows do NOT give this much credit to the art director. Especially with this much praise. So hats off to them for including this artistic genius so we can understand what was being planned.\\', \"I regret watching it dubbed as when I finished and watched a bit without the English dubbing, I was shocked by the difference in tone of voices. I was hooked and watched it pretty quickly. One thing I can\\'t understand, why is it rated 15 in the UK? Its definitely an 18. Also, why are kids in the UK watching this? Insane!\", \\'No excuses for bad shows, they had 20m budget to make this, some shows get WAY HIGHER of a budget and it doesn’t impact pop culture anywhere near this. WELL DONE \\', \\'The art director is very much a star or the show. The sets were amazing.\\', \\'i loved every bit of this masterpiece. everything put together was honestly a work of art.\\', \"From the directors to the actors, everyone working on this series was so brilliant. I definitely don\\'t think it\\'s overhyped...the characters are so compelling, the sound and art design are amazing, and it\\'s altogether a really unique and memorable show.\", \\'The props and sets are SOOOO IMPRESSIVE and honestly an art!!\\', \\'This is what Martin Scorsese meant when he said the trend of action, superhero movies is taking away from a cinematic experience, not dissing it but simply stating that the art of making a story has turned into a spread sheet of how many movies can we utilize this same formula with until the next phase?\\', \\'The fact that the writer/director wanted to cast people \"who are not as well known\", and how successful this show is in the west, shows that you don\\\\\\'t need big-name, globally popular actors to make a good movie/show, you need good directors and actors that can play their role really well.\\', \"It\\'s pretty cool hearing about how Lee Jung-jae is a big shot in Korea. It\\'s neat how he seems to talk differently than the others\", \\'This was such an incredible series with an awesome ending message. I usually hate gore, but between the acting, storyline, visual appeal of the non-gory scenes, this was a masterpiece.\\', \\'This story was so refreshing to watch after only having watched those unrealistic and artificial marvel and dc super hero movies.\\', \\'I really love how this shows the director, art director and the actors really worked harmoniously together to make the scenes and had fun while acting as well. Its incredible what can be made when you also listen to others like the people who are playing the role of your character and making something even more beautiful then what they can make on their own.\\', \\'We want to give an Oscar award for the acting\\', \\'I like how many deaths are foreshadowed in earlier scenes\\\\n\\\\n1) Ali stole money from his boss, he died having the marbles stolen from him by Sang-woo\\\\n2) Sang-woo tried to kill himself in a baththub, he died drenched in rain and sucessfully killing himself\\', \"I really want to praise the Art Director. She did a phenomenal job. I wasn\\'t sure I wanted to see something as dark and gritty like this show but the art direction was so incredibly mesmerizing I had to continue on!\", \\'As a Canadian I need more squid games in my life!! Go South Korea ️\\', \\'The art director did a fantastic job of designing everything and creating such iconic imagery. I love the cast too\\', \\'I really love how they made the characters connect with the audience indirectly. I feel like they made the main protagonists and antagonists(and those in between both) have different personalities and strengths, weaknesses,  and skills and many other things that people would love or hate because when the characters died or lived for a little longer you can really see how worldwide audiences felt impacted by it.\\', \"Anyone else shocked by how deep Gi Hun\\'s real voice is?  Lol\", \\'I so badly want a interview between Ali and Sang Woo and another with Sae byeok and Ji yeong\\', \\'The Marble scene ....\\\\nIt ripped my heart out\\\\nThis is a masterpiece \\\\nEach episode is in its own Way\\', \\'One thing about this show is about how the \"game\" was interpreted. Uniformed soldiers, the rules, colorful settings, the childhood game, and realistic. For them, it\\\\\\'s only a game, nothing more, because it\\\\\\'s the players\\\\\\' perspective that makes it a survival game. Also, none of the soldiers said kill, the players were simply eliminated.\\', \"Masterpiece is the right word for this series. It\\'s clear everyone brought their absolute best. Can\\'t wait for what\\'s to come!\", \\'omg the background score was so chilling specially that flute one... \\', \\'This series was an absolute masterpiece in every sense. This crew deserve all the credit they get.\\', \\'The art director is so creative. The colors and contrast of the set vs the costuming and also the game scenes vs regular life scenes are so well done\\', \\'The whole marble scene still makes me cry. God they rip your heart out.\\', \\'The art director knows her assignment \\', \"I\\'ve got to say, the art department did a fantastic job. The entire time watching the show you just have an uneasiness and felt a creepiness about the facility in which the games take place. Like it\\'s not overtly creepy on its own, but given the subject matter it makes it incredibly unsettling.\", \\'I feel like each character teaches you a lesson in life\\', \"I know squid game is big, but I wanna see Sang Woo in even bigger projects, damn he\\'s good..\", \"This was the most beautiful written, set and acted piece of TV I\\'ve seen in years. I was reeling for about an hour and a half after the finale. Everyone involved in this wonderful piece of art should be very proud.\", \\'The whole story and plot truly makes me and I’m sure other people feel waves of emptiness and guilt for the player’s death. The way they emphases it was amazingly done, especially the art director. Thank you cast and crew !!!! \\', \\'The fact that this show was denied for years and now it’s the biggest show out there is amazing. The director/writer never gave up on it and it paid off in the end \\', \\'This show was a masterpiece on every level congratulations to the whole team \\', \"Despite and/or because of the theme, this was one of the most beautifully put-together films insofar as set designs and artist translations I\\'ve ever seen.

A glimpse into the art director and director’s vision and how the chosen actors brilliantly executed these ideas. As troubled as I was after watching the first episode (literally stayed awake until 3am lying in bed thinking “what in the WORLD did I just watch!?) If you can get past the initial shock of the first episode, this is a great show. I couldn’t stop watching it and how humanity, social norms are broken not just for survival but out of greed, financial security, etc. But even after obtaining all these things, to still come out feeling emotionally void and empty. Clear picture that money can solve a lot of issues from a worldly perspective but it can’t save your soul. The amount of loss, trauma, physical endurance, and suffering experienced through the games, what good is money? Got me thinking of a lot of things. Not a new concept for survival-type ideas (lord of the flies, battle royale, hunger games, etc.) but I love how this was a fresh new take. I’m a fan of all things K-drama.

Not bc I didn’t think it could be good… I’ve been hearing about Korean shows and films forever people raving about them… but in the language I speak there’s just a never ending amount of options and it’s hard to keep up with all the new content bc of streaming. Im a 36 year old lgbtq woman… who fell in love with the group BTS….. so through seeing these incredible young men on stage but more importantly the wonderful, humble, loving, hard working and compassionate people that they are…. Have broadened my mind into media and truly helped my only English speaking ignorance to see different gems from other cultures out there who are creating incredibly well done and thought out art in all aspects….. so basically I’m a gay woman and I only bring that up bc ppl think most army are straight young adult girls and women… and just saying that’s so not the case for me… but fell in love with bts and their artistry… and I’m thankful bc this was such an amazing and entertaining show that I probably wouldn’t have watched before bts. Im so thankful I did… I really really really hope to see a second season… and there was a scary movie I recently watched a Korean film and I can’t remember the name… but it was absolutely insanely good…. I couldn’t believe how well don’t it was and mad I can’t remember the name lol but wow what an absolute masterpiece!!!! What a wonderful cast and it’s so nice to see them happy and smiling and sharing some funny things from set… truly incredible!!!\\', \\'I would absolutely love to see the set for the marble game as a modern art installation! \\\\nImagine walking in a museum, but ending up in a sunset alleyway. \\\\nDifferent houses and gates tell you different stories and you are free to explore every detail. \\\\nThat would be an experience!\\', \\'that set and costume design etc. The art director is brilliant, bravo!\\', \"The stray cat scene is actually incredibly effective to Gihun\\'s personality and his relationship with money. He wastes money and goods at gambling. He has to beg people for money. You hate him for  it. But when he does get a bit of money or something precious he flaunts it a bit or gives it away (i.e. the cat, the money tender girl) it gives him a sense that he wants to be a good and helpful person.

But in a world of BS remakes and reboots, it was SO refreshing to see a show that actually changes things around. Is the premise new? Maybe not. But the execution is none that I’ve seen before. That’s what matters, to me. The eerie music, the pink jump suits with black masks with different shapes on them. The CRAZY twist at the end that I think NO ONE saw coming. WOW, this’ll be hard to beat. I really hope season 2 is great. Although, I doubt it’ll be as good as the first, because the first is usually the best.

The only moments where his humanity returned sincerely, were when he was shaken after hearing Ali being shot, and when he finally shared his own memories to Gi-hun of the safety and innocence that those childhood games did bring him back then, and reflecting the barbarity of the squid game the both are playing, that safety has been shattered to the point where he thinks he’s unable to live in the real world any longer, and takes his life, it’s truly sad\\', \\'I\\\\\\'m honestly glad that the explanations were in depth and not just vapid \"cutesy\" comments tbh\\', \\'good work everyone you made hollywood look like \\', \"Bruh I was not expecting to hear about Grimms Fairy Tales aka what I basically grew up reading about, like I have a whole collection I\\'ve read more times than I can count- I\\'m so happy I\\'m cultured :)\", \\'Nah but part where sang-woo said \"I thought the masked guys where hot\" \\', \\'“Fuck… GI-HUN.” dunno if I shoulda quivered in fear or laughed my butt off because he was genuinely done with everything.

In the beginning he helped Ali to reach home, but after they came again in the game, even after knowing that he had a son and wife waiting for him at home, he still made it to kill Ali to win. We wonder why there are so little kind-hearted people in the world. The answer is this show, because even if we think that we fully trust a person, that one can use and betray you anytime without a second thought if it could help him achieve what he wants.

He was so kind, and trusting - it broke my heart to see his death come from that. My husband was most emotional at Il-nams death, The fact that the old man essentially gave his life but also teaching him a lesson in that cheating and lying isnt the way to get through life really broke him.

Great job.\\', \"I\\'m happy that they are. They did an amazing job\", \\'Saebyeok cant hold laugh  and is my favorite girl in the squid game\\', \\'I was kinda hoping for them to explain the scene of Sae-byeok’s death, because I think it really explains Sang-woo’s personality and his desperation for winning the game, and returning home with all that money. I also think it shows that Ho Yeon’s character isn’t all about “sacrifice others to get to the top”, she also experiences pain from time to time. And I really think that 4 scenes show it all. Like the scene of Sae-byeok and Cheol, Ji-young death scene, Sae-byeok in the bathroom trying to treat her injury, and the Sae-byeok death scene. All of it is really brilliant, how the director and artist worked together to plan out each detail of the character’s personalities, and how each and every detail of the set affects the mood of the present scene. That’s all I have to say but this show is really truly brilliant \\', \\'Can anybody explain to me why they kept calling the director, “director” instead of saying his name? Is it a cultural thing since he would be their boss? Or is the translation just weird?\\', \\'this show is so visually stunning!!!! chae syung-sun is a genius\\', \\'Wow.

How he let us see really. Strong and not smiling anger woman’s who can feel and show emotions and it’s not showed from bad side as all time. Old people, \"not beautiful girls and womans\", fat people, immigrants. In another shows we see not fat, people of color, \"beautiful in beauty standarts\" people with real problems. In thuis show this feels real.\\', \\'Fantabulous series ️️\\', \\'🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳\\', \\'The props and sets are SOOOO IMPRESSIVE and honestly an art!!\\', \\'Much respect to the creators actors and directors!\\', \\'The film score is great as well that it perfectly created an aural mood that heightened viewers emotions in all levels of fear, joy, and excitement.\\', \\'They’re all amazing and I cannot explain why but they are\\', \\'Everything about this show is AMAZING!!!!\\', \\'really wish the subtitles would slow down and the audio was English.

Give them all an umbrella honeycomb \\', \\'It helps so much if the writer is the director himself. The scenes tend to come out executed well because if the director is not the writer, there would be different interpretations.

And that\\'s what they did in Squid Game. It\\'s not so much about the suspense during those games, but the real suspense is the relationship and interaction between those characters. How they struggle between survival and keeping their humanity, how their true colours are revealed. No one\\'s completely good or bad. Everyone has crossed a line. I really love all their back stories too. And Joon-ho\\'s character added more suspense to the show. Slipping through episode after episode like a chameleon, until eventually finding the Front Man.

어떤행동이 정의롭고 어떤행동이 정의롭지 않다고 할 수 있는가? 이 불안정한 세상에 정의라는게 존재하기는 하는것일까? 우리는 2000년 동안 그 해답을 찾지 못했다. 모두가 yes라고 답할때 혼자 no라고 하면 no가 진실이든 거짓이든 no는 거짓이 된다. 혹시 모르지 않는가? 저 하늘의 떠 있는 별이 가상이라면 저 하늘의 떠 있는 태양이 지구를 돌고있다면 그건 거짓일까? 진실일까? 우리는 하늘의 떠 있는 별이 우주에 있는 은하 어딘가에 있는 항성이라고 배웠고 지구가 태양을 돌고있다고 배웠다 하지만 본 사람은 있는가? 우리는 yes만을 강요받아왔다 왜? No를 외치면 미친놈이 되기 때문이니까 어느 누가 태양이 지구를 돌고 있다는 생각을 정상으로 보겠는가? 하지만 만약 당신이 나가서 태양계를 보았을때 지구가 아닌 태양이 돌고있다면? 당신은 믿을 수 밖에 없다 왜냐면 그게 현실이기 때문이다. 이 영화 도입부에는 모두가 지옥이 있다는 사람들을 보고 미쳤다고 생각한다. 경찰도 그런건 없다고 생각하고 수사를 했다 하지만 직접 보니까 그 말도 안되는 현상을 보니까 그게 사실이니까 믿을 수 밖에 없다. 모두가 yes라고 외칠때 no라고 말한다면 그게 진실이든 거짓이든 거짓이다. 따라서 모두가 no라고 외칠때 yes를 외치면 신이 있든 없든 거짓이다. 상식적인 세상에서 비상식적인 생각을 누가 정상으로 보겠는가? 반대로 비상식적인 세상에서 상식적인 생각을 누가 정상으로 보냐 말이다 지옥이 있든 없든 신이 있든 없든 그들은 믿을 수 밖에 없다 왜냐? 그게 사실이니까 안 믿으면? 죽지 이단자로 몰려서 진실과 사실의 차이는 진실은 옳은 진리고 사실은 보편적인 진리다 가설이 거짓이어도 모두가 믿으면 사실이 되는것이다 진실이 아닐뿐이지 상식적인 세상에서 비상식적인 현상을 직접보고 사람들은 어떻게 받아들이겠는가 지구가 도는게 아니라 태양이 도는거면 당신은 그 진실을 어떻게 받아들일것인가? 지옥 같은 말도 안되는 소리가 진실이라면 그 사실을 어떻게 받아들여야하지? 상식적인 사회에서 비상식적인 현상이 사실이라면 더 이상 상식적인 사회가 아니다 이때까지 보고 느낀게 거짓이라면 사람들은 동요할것이다 그렇게 모두가 yes라고 말하는 세상에서 모두가 no라고 말하는 세상이 된다. 더 이상 세상은 상식적이지 않게 된다는 말이다. 이 사회에서 상식적인 정부,경찰,법,지식들은 모두 비상식적인 세상에 가져 갈 수가 없다. 무엇이 옳고 그르다고 할 수 있는지 난 2000년이 지나도 5000년이 지나도 알 수가 없다. 정의란 무엇일까? 무엇이 진실일까? 난 감히 생각조차 할 수가 없다. 법이 부정된 세상 심판이 허용된 세상 그 세상은 불법과 반정부로 이루어진 혐오의 굴레 일것이다. 다시 한번 묻겠다 모두가 살인을 한다면 그 살인은 나쁜걸까? 옳은걸까? 어떤게 옳고 그른지 우리는 죽을때까지 알 수 없다...\\', \\'이게 재밌다고?\\\\nㅋ ㅋ\\\\n차라리. 씽크홀 을 봐라\\', \\'죄인 하나 잡자고 쑥대밭을 만들고 토끼네\\', \\'이새기들이  보험도 안되게  다 떄려부시네 ㅡㅡ  사람만 잡아가면되지\\', \\'오징어 게임때매 보는거지\\', \\'재미겠다\\', \\'이 감독은 항상 소재는 좋은데 연출이 싼티남\\', \\'개 망작...\\', \\'아 솔직히.......................\\', \\'헐 이거 나왓네\\', \\'그 저 뭐냐 애니 봤던거 같은데 이거 그거 맞나요\\', \\'아니 근데 마지막에 아기는 뭐냐고~~ 몰입도는 높은데 대체 말하고자 하는게 뭔지 정의?
